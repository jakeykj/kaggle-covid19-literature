2986," Canine non-rabies combined vaccines are widely used to protect animals from infectious agents, and also play an important role in public health."
2987,We have delivered a range of antigens and immunomodulatory molecules to commercially available pigs using rPAdV and found it to be a very effective delivery system.
2988,"RESULT: To compare vaccine strains encoded with different antigen delivery and expression strategies, a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the H5N1 influenza virus, as model antigens."
2989,"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in Guangzhou, China in 2003 were caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses with high homology."
2990,A single vaccination of AdC7-M/E was sufficient to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against ZIKV in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice.
2991,"Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-ΔP expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9."
2992,"Moreover, we will review the most important and challenging steps during the industrial development of the SARS vaccine highlighting the difficulties in terms of safety working with such a highly pathogenic, unknown virus."
2993,IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) can emerge from an animal reservoir into a naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans or domestic animals.
2994,"By 2017, 18 of the 22 countries of the Region had laboratory-testing capacity, 19 had functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems and 22 had trained national rapid response teams."
2995," Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality."
2996,"Strategies adopted to overcome these issues include the use of reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains, the use of baculovirusexpressed haemagglutinin or related non-pathogenic avian influenza strains, and the use of adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity."
2997,"Given their antiviral effects, we propose that basic research be conducted on human defensins that focuses on RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and dengue virus (DENV), which are considered serious human pathogens but have posed huge challenges for vaccine development for different reasons."
2998,Not all virulence factors are virmugens.
2999,"This review describes studies in this field performed exclusively on birds (chickens, ducks and turkeys)."
3000,IMPORTANCE Recurrent PEDV outbreaks have resulted in enormous economic losses to swine industries worldwide.
3001,Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-naïve animals.
3002,"Pneumonia was more likely to occur in patients with RSV than in patients with RSV-negative ILI (44% (23/53) versus 26% (362/1393), p 0.006) or with influenza virus infection (44% versus 28% (157/560), p 0.02)."
3003,"Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in migratory waterfowl, domestic poultry, and humans in Asia during the summer of 2005 present a continuing, protean pandemic threat."
3004,"In addition, recent studies suggest that certain microbiota induce inflammasomes-dependent adaptive immunity against influenza virus infections."
3005,"Thus, we expressed and produced recombinant S1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows."
3006," Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets."
3007,"The use of MDCK cells to propagate vaccine virus from egg-isolated influenza virus strains does not introduce a new or greater adventitious virus risk, compared with egg-based vaccine production."
3008,"Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(3), 224–229."
3009,Widespread use of the existing quadrivalent influenza vaccine might be useful for the prevention of FS related to the flu.
3010,"The M2e-MAP-based vaccine protected immunized mice against both clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus challenge, being able to counteract weight lost and elevate survival rate following lethal challenge of H5N1 viruses."
3011,: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as a serious pathogen in people with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions.
3012,"It is very important to understand the interactions of parasite and virus, and can be used as reference data for the control and prevention of co-infections of T. gondii and viruses in pigs."
3013,How to activate host immunity against specific TAAs and to suppress tumor growth therefore becomes important in cancer therapy development.
3014,"Furthermore, we performed a risk factor analysis on the 183 herds with a full-line production."
3015,(plaque-forming unit) of adenoviral vector were completely protected against challenge with up to 10(4) × MLD(50) of BoNT/C.
3016,"Results Of the 1 540 076 incoming travellers, 1224 cases of influenza-like illness were identified; 261 tested positive in the rapid test, and 176 were confirmed to be influenza through virus culture."
3017,"Due to its unique ability to readily induce humoral as well as cellular immune responses, it attracted great interest when the concept was first confirmed in the early 1990s."
3018,"Respiratory illnesses were common, and 8 (32%) PUI were confirmed to have influenza."
3019,"The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control."
3020,Influenza pneumonia was diagnosed in three patients (7.3%).
3021,"In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids."

3023,"Laboratory-acquired avian influenza H7N7 has been reported, and the laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2 could also be the cause of another pandemic."
3024,"To simplify this procedure, IgY antibodies specific for poxviral proteins (F1L and p28) were generated by immunisation of chickens, because antibody retrieval from eggs allows the non-invasive generation of huge amounts of antibodies."
3025,"The prevalence of viruses and bacteria increased, from 7.4% and 15.4% before the Hajj to 45.4% and 31.0% after the Hajj, respectively, due to the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus."
3026,"Antisera against each targeted virus exhibited limited cross-species binding and, to a lesser extent, cross-neutralization."
3027,"In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBD, which can induce protective antibodies to SARS-CoV, may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine."
3028,"Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole‐body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells."
3029,"doses of 2/6-VLPs plus mLT (VLP3×), three i.n."
3030,"The Coronaviridae family, an enveloped RNA virus family, and, more particularly, human coronaviruses (HCoV), were historically known to be responsible for a large portion of common colds and other upper respiratory tract infections."

3064," In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) was assessed as a means of detecting foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-infected cattle before and after the development of clinical signs."
3065,Influenza-vaccinated children were 1·6 times (P = 0·001) more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza ILI.
3066, Background The recent influenza pandemic caused by the 2009 California H1N1strain increased awareness of the importance of influenza among hospitalized patients but there are few reports on other influenza strains and other non influenza respiratory viral infections in hospitalised patients.
3067,"After challenge with a heterologous strain, there was a rapid boost in NA titres, indicating a priming effect of the vaccine."
