735,Zoonotic infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and avian influenza A/H5N1 are examples of acute ‘atypical’ pneumonia with epidemic and pandemic potentials.
736,"Experimental introduction of the A528V mutation into the wild-type spike protein resulted in the loss of MAb binding of the mutant protein, confirming that the single point mutation was responsible for the escape of BCV from immunological selective pressure."
737,"?As fomite transmission caused clusters of infection of SARS, adequate disinfection?operations should be adopted in SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."
738,"Conclusion These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples."
739,"In particular, respiratory infections are problematic; in early 2003, World Health Organization issued a worldwide alert for a previously unrecognized illness that was subsequently found to be caused by a novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus]."
740,"Intestinal content samples were collected from 101 broiler flocks from several regions of Jordan to detect the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, reovirus, and rotavirus, by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."
741,Evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in non-human primates clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine.
742,"Therefore, the availability of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV may be crucial for the control of future SARS outbreaks."
743,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be screened and diagnosed through the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
