185,"The resultant ACE2-L584A mutant trafficked to the cell membrane and facilitated SARS-CoV entry into target cells, suggesting that the ACE2 ectodomain regulates its release and that residue L584 might be part of a putative sheddase “recognition motif.” Thus ACE2 must be cell associated to serve as a CoV receptor and soluble ACE2 might play a role in modifying inflammatory processes at the airway mucosal surface."
186,Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic.
