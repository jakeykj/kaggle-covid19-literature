2947,Results indicate rotavirus immunoglobulin G1 antibodies in colostrum and milk were elevated after intramuscular and intramammary vaccination of pregnant cows with an Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center rotavirus vaccine but not after intramuscular immunization with a commercial rota-coronavirus vaccine.
2948,"Thus, promazine did not affect SARS-CoV replication in vitro or in vivo, nor were any other phenothiazines efficacious in reducing virus replication."
2949,"Among all the viruses tested, only two were detected: rhinovirus was detected in 12.6% and Coronavirus 229E in 0.6%."
2950,"Thus, only drug testing using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates."
2951,This motif is absent from other coronaviruses.
2952,"The discovery of the SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of >8000 people in >30 countries with fatality of about 10%, resulted in intense search for novel coronaviruses with potentially high pathogenicity."
2953, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002 and spread to 29 countries.
2954,Lentiviruses pseudotyped with their spike proteins (S) were compared to analyze the entry efficiency of various coronaviruses.
2955," The coronavirus family (Coronaviridae) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, with a size of 27kb."
2956,"Fragment of approximately 15 g F(ab′)(2) was obtained from 1 litre antiserum and the purity was above 90% with the titer of 1:5120, which could neutralize the other strain (SARS-CoV Z2-Y3) as well."
2957,"Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics."
2958,The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle.
2959," In 2012 in Jordan, infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused the first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
2960,"This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as &ldquo;coronavirus disease 2019&rdquo; (COVID-19)."
2961,"Specific pathogen free kittens were vaccinated with an unattenuated field isolate of canine coronavirus (ccv) either by aerosol or subcutaneously, and received boosting vaccinations four weeks later."
2962, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly lethal emerging disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV.
2963,"Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-∆E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence."
2964,"Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2."
2965,"A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic."
2966,"An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention."
2967,"The respiratory viruses—which include influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses—cause the majority of these illnesses."
2968,"The infection on Vero E6—a permissive cell line to SARS-CoV—could be neutralized by sera from convalescent SARS patients, and the entry was a pH-dependent process."

2970,"Viral envelope proteins from a variety of human pathogens including HIV-1, influenza virus, Lassa virus, SARS, Zika virus, dengue virus, and Ebola virus have evolved to be extensively glycosylated."
2971, The spike protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important target for anti-SARS drug discovery.
2972,These conserved SNVs were gradually lost from the genomes of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 SARS epidemic.
2973,SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies.
2974,"Here, we report that, similar to the A82V mutation in Ebola glycoprotein, in the S glycoprotein of murine coronavirus MHV-A59, the histidine residue at position of 209 significantly affects the thermal stability of the S protein, determines whether S protein can be activated at 37°C by either pH 8.0 alone or by receptor binding, and affects viral fitness in cell culture."
2975,"Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics to combat these highly pathogenic coronaviruses."
