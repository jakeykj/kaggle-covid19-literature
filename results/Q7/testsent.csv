0," Introduction The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold."
1,"As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease."
2,"To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese–Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline."
3,Methods The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19.
4,"We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world."
5,"Results We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline."
6,TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients’ disease status.
7,Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases.
8,Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses.
9,Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases.
10,"Conclusion To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures."
11,Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines.
12,Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.
13,New threat: 2019 novel Coronavirus infection and infection control perspective in Turkey
14,": The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019."
15,"As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths."
16,The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
17,METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley.
18,"In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus."
19,"The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors’ affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis."
20,All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.
21,RESULTS: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%).
22,The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars.
23,"Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control."
24,"Studies thus far have shown that the virus’ origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed."
25,"Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea."
26,"Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission."
27,"To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care."
28,CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
29,"During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus."
30,"Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term."
31,"Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia."
32,No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease.
33,The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently.
34,"At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment."
35,"In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed."
36,"Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed."
37,"Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced."
38," The pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style."
39,Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone.
40,"We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts."
41,Strengths and limitations are discussed.
42,"If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively."
43, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.
44,"Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19."
45,Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments.
46,Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak.
47,"Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people."
48,"In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease."
49,"Motivated by the rapid spread of COVID-19 all across the globe, we have performed simulations of a system dynamic epidemic spread model in different possible situations."
50,"The simulation, not only captures the model dynamic of the spread of the virus, but also, takes care of population and mobility data."
51,"The model is calibrated based on epidemic data and events specifically of Sultanate of Oman, which can easily be generalized."
52,"The simulation results are quite disturbing, indicating that, during a process of stringent social distancing and testing strategies, a small perturbation can lead to quite undesirable outcomes."
53,"The simulation results, although consistent in expected outcomes across changing parameters' values, also indicate a substantial mismatch with real numbers."
54,An analysis of what can be the reason of this mismatch is also performed.
55,"Within these contradictions, for Oman, regarding the eradication of epidemic, the future is not extremely alarming."
56,"Introduction: Recently, a new strain of coronaviruses, which originated from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China has been identified."
57,"According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential."
58,"Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features."
59,"Methods: This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed."
60,"We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19."
61,We used STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis.
62,"Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied."
63,"The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%), respectively."
64,"The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia (61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%)."
65,The study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically severe patients.
66,"Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent."
67,"Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients."
68,"Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue."
69,"Objective To determine the correlation between menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis of COVID-19, and to identify potential protective factors for female patients."
70,"Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020."
71,"Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared."
72,The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted.
73,Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p<0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902).
74,435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records were recruited.
75,"By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients recovered and discharged (25.3%)."
76,"Multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and severity indicated that post-menopausal patients show the greater risk of hospitalization time than non-menopausal patients (relative hazard [RH], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46)Logistic regression model showed that higher AMH as a control for age increases the risk of severity of COVID-19 (HR=0.146, 95%CI= (0.026-0.824) p=0.029)."
77,"E2 showed protective effect against disease severity (HR=0.335, 95%CI= (0.105-1.070), p=0.046).In the Mann-Whitney U test, the higher levels of IL6 and IL8 were found in severe group (p=0.040, 0.033).The higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points(p＜0.001,＜0.001, =0.009, = 0.040).E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL2R, IL6, IL8 and TNFα in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030)."
78,Conclusions and Relevance Menopause is an independent risk factor for COVID-19.
79,E2 and AMH are negatively correlated with COVID-19 severity probably due to their regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation.
80, The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19.
81,"This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state."
82,"This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012."
83,"While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death."
84,"It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province."
85,"Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients."
86,"Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident."
87,"While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective."
88,Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy.
89,"However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges."
90,"The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally."
91,"Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world."
92,"Background There had been a preliminary occurrence of human-to-human transmissions between healthcare workers (HCWs), but risk factors in the susceptibility for COVID-19, and infection patterns among HCWs have largely remained unknown."
93,"Methods Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center."
94,"Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively."
95,"Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020."
96,Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed.
97,Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs.
98,COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs.
99,"Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk."
100,"An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61]."
101,"By reducing the average contact rate per HCW by a 1.35 factor and susceptibility by a 1.40 factor, we can avoid an outbreak of the basic case among HCWs."
102,Interpretation Poor sleep quality and high working pressure were positively associated with high risks of COVID-19.
103,A novel IBM of COVID-19 transmission is suitable for simulating different outbreak patterns in a hospital setting.
104,There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 as a new emerging epidemic.
105,"In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable."
106,"However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic."
107,"Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities."

109,Analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from different species sheds some light on cross-species receptor usage of a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV
110,"Objective: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, or (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19."
111,Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included.
112,Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection.
113,"Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020."
114,Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model.
115,Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts.
116,"Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST."
117,"Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance."
118,Results: 1916 titles were screened.
119,"Of these, 15 studies describing 19 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal."
120,"We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; nine diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (seven of which were deep learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and seven prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, or length of hospital stay."
121,None of the 15 studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China.
122,"Predictors included in more than one of the 19 models were: age, sex, comorbidities, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte markers (percentage or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), lactate dehydrogenase, and features derived from CT images."
123,"Reported C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 5 of the 9 diagnostic models), and from 0.90 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 4 of the 7 prognostic models)."
124,"All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting."
125,Reporting quality varied substantially between studies.
126,"A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed."
127,"Conclusion: COVID-19 related prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis are quickly entering the academic literature through publications and preprint reports, aiming to support medical decision making in a time where this is needed urgently."
128,Many models were poorly reported and all appraised as high risk of bias.
129,We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies worldwide to support collaborative efforts in building more rigously developed and validated COVID-19 related prediction models.
130,The predictors identified in current studies should be considered for potential inclusion in new models.
131,"We also stress the need to adhere to methodological standards when developing and evaluating COVID-19 related predictions models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions about COVID-19 in the current pandemic."
132," Because in the past vaccines were considered inherently safe, only limited nonclinical testing used to be required."
133,"However, from about 2003 more stringent nonclinical testing guidelines were introduced for novel vaccines (and, in some cases, marketed vaccines attempting registration in new markets) given that vaccines are typically administered to healthy individuals, often infants."
134,"These safety considerations become even more important as technologies allowing the development of novel vaccine types are developed, such as DNA vaccines and those delivered in vector systems such as adenoviral vectors."
135,The use of adjuvants other than the standard aluminum-based ones and novel delivery systems such as electrostimulation have also led to additional testing requirements.
136,This chapter describes the current regulatory expectations for the preclinical development of vaccines.
137,Several factors should be taken into account when it comes to the first exposure of humans to a novel vaccine.
138,"Over the past century, vaccines have made a large impact on public health."
139,"Prophylactic vaccines prevent disability and disease, saving millions of dollars in potential health-care spending."
140,"Since prophylactic vaccines are administered to healthy individuals, including infants and children, it is important to demonstrate the safety of vaccines preclinically prior to testing the vaccine in clinical studies."
141,"A benefit-to-risk profile is considered for each individual vaccine and depends on many factors including preclinical and clinical toxicities that are observed, frequency of administration and intended target population."
142,"For prophylactic vaccines, in particular, the concerns about potential risks often outweigh the perception of benefit [1]."
143,"Therefore, over the past decade, there has been an increased focus on nonclinical safety assessment of vaccines, including toxicity testing."

145, The ability of a pure virus infection to induce an acute phase protein response is of interest as viral infections are normally considered to be less efficient in inducing an acute phase protein response than bacterial infections.
146,"This was studied in a bovine model for infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), analysing the induction of the two most dominant bovine acute phase proteins haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA)."
147,"Strong and reproducible acute phase responses were detected for both proteins, peaking at around 7–8 days after inoculation of BRSV, while no response was seen in mock-inoculated control animals."
148,The serum concentrations reached for SAA and haptoglobin during the BRSV-induced acute phase response were generally the same or higher than previously reported for bacterial infections in calves.
149,The magnitude and the duration of the haptoglobin response was found to correlate well with the severity of clinical signs (fever) and with the extent of lung consolidation while SAA responded most rapidly to infection.
150,"Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are closely related, recently emerged paramyxoviruses that form Henipavirus genus and are capable of causing considerable morbidity and mortality in a number of mammalian species, including humans."
151,"However, in contrast to many other species and despite expression of functional virus entry receptors, mice are resistant to henipavirus infection."
152,We report here the susceptibility of mice deleted for the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-KO) to both HeV and NiV.
153,"Intraperitoneally infected mice developed fatal encephalitis, with pathology and immunohistochemical features similar to what was found in humans."
154,"Viral RNA was found in the majority of analyzed organs, and sublethally infected animals developed virus-specific neutralizing antibodies."
155,"Altogether, these results reveal IFNAR-KO mice as a new small animal model to study HeV and NiV pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment and suggest the critical role of type I interferon signaling in the control of henipavirus infection."
156," The purpose of this subacute 22-day study was to evaluate methods for canine circulating immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, and IgE) and select B- and T-lymphocyte populations (CD4-helpers, CD8-suppressors, pan-T and pan-B) for immunotoxicity testing using an organ system (concordance) approach."
157,"The challenge substance for immunoglobulin testing was repeated immunization with six-way distemper vaccination (DHLAPP), while the challenge substance for leukocyte subpopulations was treatment with cyclophosphamide."
158,"Immunoglobulin measurements were made by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and leukocyte immunophenotyping by fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin conjugation (flow cytometry)."
159,A battery of parameters that would be used in a typical regulatory study were taken to aid interpretation of the data generated by these methods.
160,"Body weights, food consumption, clinical observations, complete clinical chemistry and urinalysis measurements were taken."
161,"Gross pathology and micropathology of sternal bone marrow, spleen, mesenteric and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney were completed."
162,"The ELISA method demonstrated acceptable intra-assay reproducibility for IgM, IgG and IgE, with values in good agreement as reported for radial immunodiffusion."
163,"The immunologic challenge demonstrated a biological trend of an increase in IgM that preceded an increase in IgG with no discernible trend in IgE response, and no abnormalities in lymphocyte subpopulations."
164,Principle flow cytometry findings related to cyclophosphamide were that the relative percent of B cells decreased dramatically and progressively after compound administration; being statistically decreased in males on day 22 compared with day −5.
165,"The relative percent CD4 and CD8 contribution increased, but the CD4/CD8 ratio remained relatively unchanged as total white blood cells decreased progressively."
166,"The increase in relative percent CD4 (males only) was statistically significant according to a two-sample t-test on days 17, 20 and 22 when compared with the pre-treatment day −5."
167,"There was a relative percent increase in CD5-panT, but absolute numbers were dramatically decreased."
168,"We conclude that an organ system approach to assessment of the immune system which incorporates humoral antibody, enumeration of lymphocyte populations and pathologic evaluation of the lymphoreticular organs assists in the interpretation of an adverse toxicological response."
169,"The ELISA method for measurement of Igs detected the expected levels of IgG, IgM and IgE due to repeated vaccinations and to cyclophosphamide treatment."
170,The flow cytometry method was acceptable for measuring select canine lymphocyte populations and detecting the expected decrease in B cells due to cyclophosphamide treatment.
171,Both methods may be added to a testing battery for assessing immunotoxicity in canine regulatory studies.
172,"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tickborne disease that circulates in wild and domestic animal hosts, and causes severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever in infected humans."
173,"Due to the lack of treatment options or vaccines, and a high fatality rate, CCHF virus (CCHFV) is considered a high-priority pathogen according to the WHO R&D Blueprint."
174,"Several commercial reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and serological diagnostic assays for CCHFV are already available, including febrile agent panels to distinguish CCHFV from other viral haemorrhagic fever agents; however, the majority of international laboratories use inhouse assays."
175,"As CCHFV has numerous amplifying animal hosts, a cross-sectoral ‘One Health’ approach to outbreak prevention is recommended to enhance notifications and enable early warning for genetic and epidemiological shifts in the human, animal and tick populations."
176,"However, a lack of guidance for surveillance in animals, harmonisation of case identification and validated serodiagnostic kits for animal testing hinders efforts to strengthen surveillance systems."
177,"Additionally, as RT-PCR tests tend to be lineage-specific for regional circulating strains, there is a need for pan-lineage sensitive diagnostics."
178,Adaptation of existing tests to point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms that can be implemented in clinic or field-based settings would be of value given the potential for CCHFV outbreaks in remote or low-resource areas.
179,"Finally, improved access to clinical specimens for validation of diagnostics would help to accelerate development of new tests."
180,These gaps should be addressed by updated target product profiles for CCHFV diagnostics.
181,"Indirect modification of animal genomes by interspecific hybridization, cross-breeding, and selection has produced an enormous spectrum of phenotypic diversity over more than 10,000 yr of animal domestication."
182,"Using these established technologies, the farming community has successfully increased the yield and efficiency of production in most agricultural species while utilizing land resources that are often unsuitable for other agricultural purposes."
183,"Moving forward, animal well-being and agricultural sustainability are moral and economic priorities of consumers and producers alike."
184,"Therefore, these considerations will be included in any strategy designed to meet the challenges produced by global climate change and an expanding world population."
185,Improvements in the efficiency and precision of genetic technologies will enable a timely response to meet the multifaceted food requirements of a rapidly increasing world population.
186,": Despite the crucial role of domestic dogs as reservoirs for zoonosis and some of the most threatening diseases for wild carnivores such as distemper and parvovirosis, little is known about the epidemiological features and the risk factors involved in pathogen exposure of dogs that live in human/wildlife interfaces and actually contacts wildlife."
187,"Through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic Forest fragments in southeast Brazil."
188,"RESULTS: Widespread exposure to canine parvovirus (97 %), canine distemper virus (15 %) and canine adenovirus (27 %) was detected, but none for canine coronavirus."
189,Dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks.
190,"Exposure was associated with dog sex and age, lack of health care and the number of people in the households."
191,"Remarkably, factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected."
192,"CONCLUSIONS: According to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog’s movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance."
193,Promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary.
194,"The study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs, and consequently of Atlantic Forest’s wild carnivores."
195,This study describes two longitudinal serological surveys of European Bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) antibodies in serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) maternity colonies located in the North-East of France.
196,This species is currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir.
197,Multievent capture-recapture models were used to determine the factors influencing bat rabies transmission as this method accounts for imperfect detection and uncertainty in disease states.
198,"Considering the period of study, analyses revealed that survival and recapture probabilities were not affected by the serological status of individuals, confirming the capacity of bats to be exposed to lyssaviruses without dying."
199,"Five bats have been found with EBLV-1 RNA in the saliva at the start of the study, suggesting they were caught during virus excretion period."
200,"Among these bats, one was interestingly recaptured one year later and harbored a seropositive status."
201,"Along the survey, some others bats have been observed to both seroconvert (i.e."
202,move from a negative to a positive serological status) and serorevert (i.e.
203,move from a positive to a negative serological status).
204,Peak of seroprevalence reached 34% and 70% in site A and B respectively.
205,"On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony."
206,Seroprevalence were affected by significantly higher seroprevalence in summer than in spring.
207,The maximum time observed between successive positive serological statuses of a bat demonstrated the potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least 4 years.
208,"At last, EBLV-1 serological status transitions have been shown driven by age category with higher seroreversion frequencies in adults than in juvenile."
209,"Juveniles and female adults seemed indeed acting as distinct drivers of the rabies virus dynamics, hypothesis have been addressed but their exact role in the EBLV-1 transmission still need to be specified."
210, Foodborne illness is a serious public health concern.
211,"There are over 200 known microbial, chemical, and physical agents that are known to cause foodborne illness."
212,"Efforts are made for improved detection, control and prevention of foodborne pathogen in food, and pathogen associated diseases in the host."
213,"Several commonly used approaches to control foodborne pathogens include antibiotics, natural antimicrobials, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, ionizing radiations, and heat."
214,"In addition, probiotics offer a potential intervention strategy for the prevention and control of foodborne infections."
215,"This review focuses on the use of probiotics and bioengineered probiotics to control foodborne pathogens, their antimicrobial actions, and their delivery strategies."
216,"Although probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective in antagonizing foodborne pathogens, challenges exist in the characterization and elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms of action and in the development of potential delivery strategies that could maintain the viability and functionality of the probiotic in the target organ."
217," Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been used extensively during the past four decades for research and nonclinical development because they are close to humans in terms of genetics, anatomy, physiology, and immunology."
218,"They have been widely used in the development of infection models, leading to the generation of vaccines and drugs, as well as in the nonclinical pharmacologic and toxicologic assessment of biopharmaceuticals, especially in the fields of immunotherapy and oncology, despite the constant pressure to move to lower species."
219,"In many cases, NHPs are the only species that allows a correct risk assessment for humans."
220,"Nevertheless, limitations inherent to each species have to be considered before an investigation."
221,"This chapter shines some light on the respective interests and limitations of using cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and marmosets in medical research and nonclinical development, with a specific focus on reproduction and immunology."
222," Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus (LASV), which is endemic throughout much of West Africa."
223,The virus primarily circulates in the Mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions; human-to-human transmission is documented as well.
224,"With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus."
225,On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality.
226,"Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics."
227,"Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection."
228,"Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials."
229,"Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans."
230,This review briefly discusses the epidemiology and biology of LASV infection and highlights recent progress in vaccine development.
231,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months."
232,"As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines."
233,"So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2."
234,"The research includes the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs."
235,The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time.
236,"Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process."
237,"Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required."
238,"Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19."
239,Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing.
240,"Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Saquinavir (DrugBank ID DB01232) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions."
241,Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID 19 treatment.
242,The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.
243,"Guided by the principle of primum non nocere (first do no harm), we report a cautionary note on the potential fatal toxicity of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with anti-diabetic drug metformin."
244,"We observed that the combination of CQ or HCQ and metformin, which were used in our studies as potential anti-cancer drugs, killed 30-40% of mice."
245,"While our observations in mice may not translate to toxicity in humans, the reports that CQ or HCQ has anti-COVID-19 activity, the use of CQ resulting in toxicity and at least one death, and the recent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for CQ and HCQ by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prompted our report."
246,Here we report the lethality of CQ or HCQ in combination with metformin as a warning of its potential serious clinical toxicity.
247,"We hope that our report will be helpful to stimulate pharmacovigilance and monitoring of adverse drug reactions with the use of CQ or HCQ, particularly in combination with metformin."
248,For the last 50 years we have known of a broad-spectrum agent tilorone dihydrochloride (Tilorone).
249,This is a small-molecule orally bioavailable drug that was originally discovered in the USA and is currently used clinically as an antiviral in Russia and the Ukraine.
250,Over the years there have been numerous clinical and non-clinical reports of its broad spectrum of antiviral activity.
251,"More recently we have identified additional promising antiviral activities against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Chikungunya, Ebola and Marburg which highlights that this old drug may have other uses against new viruses."
252,This may in turn inform the types of drugs that we need for virus outbreaks such as for the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
253,Tilorone has been long neglected by the west in many respects but it deserves further reassessment in light of current and future needs for broad-spectrum antivirals.
254," The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide."
255,"Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing."
256,"In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2."
257,"The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM)."
258,"Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases."
259,"However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1,000 nM."
260,"In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2."
261,"Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2."
262,"What We Know So Far (As of March 26, 2020) About COVID-19 – An MRT Point of View"
263,"Over 100,000 cases of COVID-19 patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 have been reported worldwide in approximately 2 months, resulting in over 3000 deaths."
264,"Potential therapeutic strategies, including remdesivir, chloroquine phosphate, abidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, plasma, antibody, vaccine and stem cells are discussed in this review."
265,"With the number of patients increasing daily, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic intervention."
266," Aims A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19)."
267,"Until today >2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries."
268,Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago.
269,"Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for >8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths."
270,"Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases."
271,The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
272,"Materials and methods In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp."
273,"Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin."
274,"Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease."
275,Significance The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs.
276,"Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection."
277,"Background: Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19, based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2."
278,Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression.
279,"We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays."
280,Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs.
281,Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies.
282,Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses than typically administered to patients.
283,Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression.
284,"Conclusion: Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19."
285,We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.
286,The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date.
287,An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein.
288,The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP).
289,It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.
290,We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge.
291,A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice.
292,Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible.
293,Nucleocapsid proteins within COVID-19 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage.
294,A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.
295, The SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus candidate recently detected in China that is now reported in people on inhabited continents.
296,The virus shares a high level of identity with some bat coronaviruses and is recognised as a potentially zoonotic virus.
297,"We are utilizing the One Health concept to understand the emergence of the virus, as well as to point to some possible control strategies that might reduce the spread of the virus across the globe; thus, containment of such virus would be possible."
298,"Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."
299,"Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks."
300,"Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously."
301,"Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."
302,Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells.
303,We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals.
304,"Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far."
305,"This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not."
306, Introduction Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic.
307,Objective This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19.
308,"Discussion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets."
309,Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses.
310,"Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
311,"Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities."
312,Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask.
313,"Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases."
314,"Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine."
315,Conclusion This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.
316,"Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak."
317,"It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development."
318,"A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines."
319,Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used.
320,A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review.
321,Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published.
322,A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia.
323,"However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future."
324,Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline.
325,The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate.
326,A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV.
327,"Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV."
328,"However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence."
329," The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern."
330,The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation.
331,The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase.
332,"When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment."
333,Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care.
334,"Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2."
335,"Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response."
336,"Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed."
337,"We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways."
338," The unmet need for effective antivirals against potential agents of bioterrorism and emerging infections is obvious; however, the challenges to develop such drugs are daunting."
339,"Even with the passage of Project BioShield and more recently the BARDA legislation, there is still not a clear market for these types of drugs and limited federal funding available to support expensive drug development studies."
340,"SIGA Technologies, Inc. is a small biotech company committed to developing novel products for the prevention and treatment of severe infectious diseases, with an emphasis on products for diseases that could result from bioterrorism."
341,Through trials and error SIGA has developed an approach to this problem in order to establish the infrastructure necessary to successfully advance new antiviral drugs from the discovery stage on through to licensure.
342,"The approach that we have taken to drug development is biology driven and dependent on a dispersive development model utilizing essential collaborations with academic, federal, and private sector partners."
343,This consortium approach requires success in acquiring grants and contracts as well as iterative communication with the government and regulatory agencies.
344,"However, it can work as evidenced by the rapid progress of our lead antiviral against smallpox, ST-246, and should serve as the template for development of new antivirals against important biological pathogens."
345,Preclinical therapeutics development research is directed toward fulfilling two overlapping sets of goals.
346,"A set of scientific goals includes defining the best molecule or biologic construct for the task at hand, and proving the case for its development."
347,The second set of goals addresses regulatory requirements necessary to introduce the agent into human subjects.
348,"In the case of “small molecule” drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward."
349,"In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges."
350,The nature of the “drug” may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination.
351,"Its properties may vary depending on the scale and method of its preparation, purification, and storage."
352,How to test adequately for its safety prior to first introduction in humans may not be straightforward owing to intrinsic differences in response to the agent expected in humans as compared to animals.
353,Preclinical development of and research on potential Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) medical countermeasures remain preliminary; advancements are needed before most countermeasures are ready to be tested in human clinical trials.
354,"Research priorities include standardization of animal models and virus stocks for studying disease pathogenesis and efficacy of medical countermeasures; development of MERS-CoV diagnostics; improved access to nonhuman primates to support preclinical research; studies to better understand and control MERS-CoV disease, including vaccination studies in camels; and development of a standardized clinical trial protocol."
355,Partnering with clinical trial networks in affected countries to evaluate safety and efficacy of investigational therapeutics will strengthen efforts to identify successful medical countermeasures.
356," Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS."
357,"The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics."
358,"The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures."
359,"To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments."
360,"Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East."
361,The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them.
362,"Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines."
363,For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans.
364,In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral pathogens.
365,Ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there are no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments.
366,"Several vaccines have provided immune protection in laboratory animals, but because outbreaks occur unpredictably and sporadically, vaccine efficacy cannot be proven in human trials, which is required for traditional regulatory approval."
367,"The Food and Drug Administration has introduced the 'animal rule', to allow laboratory animal data to be used to show efficacy when human trials are not logistically feasible."
368,"In this Review, we describe immune correlates of vaccine protection against Ebola virus in animals."
369,This research provides a basis for bridging the gap from basic research to human vaccine responses in support of the licensing of vaccines through the animal rule.
370,"A subunit vaccine, RBD-S, is under development to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is classified by the US NIH as a category C pathogen."
371,"This vaccine is comprised of a recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and formulated on alum, together with a synthetic glucopyranosyl lipid A."
372,The vaccine would induce neutralizing antibodies without causing Th2-type immunopathology.
373,Vaccine development is being led by the nonprofit product development partnership; Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in collaboration with two academic partners (the New York Blood Center and University of Texas Medical Branch); an industrial partner (Immune Design Corporation); and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.
374,A roadmap for the product development of the RBD-S SARS vaccine is outlined with a goal to manufacture the vaccine for clinical testing within the next 5 years.
375,"Globally, there are a number of emerging pathogens."
376,"For most, there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development."
377,"However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge."
378,Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti‐microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro‐organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential.
379,"Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease."
380,Vaccination provides a defence against these emerging pathogens.
381,"However, vaccines for pathogens which cause severe, but occasional, disease outbreaks in endemic pockets have suffered from a lack of commercial incentive for development to a clinical standard, encompassing Phase III clinical trials for efficacy."
382,"An alternative is to develop such vaccines to request US Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), or equivalent status in the United States, Canada and the European Union, making use of a considerable number of regulatory mechanisms that are available prior to licensing."
383,"This review covers the status of vaccine development for some of the emerging pathogens, the hurdles that need to be overcome to achieve EUA or an equivalent regional or national status and how these considerations may impact vaccine development for the future, such that a more comprehensive stockpile of promising vaccines can be achieved."
384,An effective DNA vaccine platform for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
385," Severe viral infections, including hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, occur throughout the world, but are most prevalent in developing areas that are most vulnerable to infectious diseases."
386,Some of these can also infect related species as illustrated by the threatened extinction of gorillas by Ebola infection in west and central Africa.
387,There are no safe and effective treatments available for these serious infections.
388,"In addition to the logistical difficulties inherent in developing a drug for infections that are sporadic and occur mainly in the third world, there is the overwhelming barrier of no hope for return on investment to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to address these unmet medical needs."
389,"Therefore, the National Institute of Allergy and infectious Disease (NIAID) has developed and supported a variety of programs and resources to provide assistance and lower the barrier for those who undertake these difficult challenges."
390,The primary programs relevant to the development of therapies for severe viral infections are described and three case studies illustrate how they have been used.
391,"In addition, contact information for accessing these resources is supplied."
392, Concerns about the safety and adequacy of the blood supply have fostered twenty years of research into the so-called “blood substitutes” among them the oxygen carriers based on modified hemoglobin.
393,"Although none of these materials has yet been licensed for use in North America or Europe, the results of research and clinical trials have increased our understanding of oxygen delivery and its regulation."
394,"In particular, the examination of the basis for the vasoactivity observed with some of the hemoglobin based oxygen carriers has led to the insight that several colligative properties of hemoglobin solutions, such as their diffusion coefficient for oxygen, viscosity and colloid oncotic pressure, are important determinants of efficacy."
395,Human bocavirus (HBoV) was identified as the second human parvovirus with pathogenic potential in 2005 in respiratory samples from children suffering from viral respiratory infections of unknown etiology.
396,"Since its first description, a large number of clinical studies have been performed that address the clinical significance of HBoV detection and the molecular biology of the virus."
397,"This review summarizes the most important steps taken in HBoV research to date and addresses open questions that need to be answered in the future to provide a better understanding of the role of a virus that is difficult to grow in cell culture and is suspected to be a pathogen, although it has not yet fulfilled Koch’s postulates."
398,The use of small animal models for the study of infectious disease is critical for understanding disease progression and for developing prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options.
399,"For many diseases, Syrian golden hamsters have emerged as an ideal animal model due to their low cost, small size, ease of handling, and ability to accurately reflect disease progression in humans."
400,"Despite the increasing use and popularity of hamsters, there remains a lack of available reagents for studying hamster immune responses."
401,"Without suitable reagents for assessing immune responses, researchers are left to examine clinical signs and disease pathology."
402,This becomes an issue for the development of vaccine and treatment options where characterizing the type of immune response generated is critical for understanding protection from disease.
403,"Despite the relative lack of reagents for use in hamsters, significant advances have been made recently with several hamster specific immunologic methods being developed."
404,"Here we discuss the progress of this development, with focus on classical methods used as well as more recent molecular methods."
405,We outline what methods are currently available for use in hamsters and what is readily used as well as what limitations still exist and future perspectives of reagent and assay development for hamsters.
406,This will provide valuable information to researchers who are deciding whether to use hamsters as an animal model.
407,"Currently, there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular pathogenesis for many high-consequence pathogens (HCPs) that pose threats to both national and international public health."
408,"In spite of this, investigations of the molecular pathogenesis for many HCPs have been limited to gross pathological changes in animal models or global analysis of gene expression."
409,"Further, questions remain regarding the ability of animal models of disease to recapitulate human molecular pathogenesis or act as predictors of therapeutic efficacy."
410,"Thus, it is likely that medical countermeasure development for HCPs will rely on identifying therapeutic targets that are uniquely modulated during HCP infection."
411,It is also appreciated that many cellular processes can be regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through phosphorylation events.
412,"Cellular kinases, individually or collectively (the kinome), play critical roles in regulating complex biology, underlie various malignancies, and represent high-priority drug targets."
413,The growing interest in kinases in both basic and translational research has driven efforts to develop technologies that enable characterization of phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction.
414,"To this end, enhanced technical capabilities at the IRF-Frederick provide the unique capability for characterizing host responses to HCP insult during the course of infection and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention."
415,"In light of the recent outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in West Africa, there have been renewed efforts to search for effective antiviral countermeasures."
416,A range of compounds currently available with broad antimicrobial activity have been tested for activity against EBOV.
417,"Using live EBOV, eighteen candidate compounds were screened for antiviral activity in vitro."
418,"The compounds were selected on a rational basis because their mechanisms of action suggested that they had the potential to disrupt EBOV entry, replication or exit from cells or because they had displayed some antiviral activity against EBOV in previous tests."
419,"Nine compounds caused no reduction in viral replication despite cells remaining healthy, so they were excluded from further analysis (zidovudine; didanosine; stavudine; abacavir sulphate; entecavir; JB1a; Aimspro; celgosivir; and castanospermine)."
420,A second screen of the remaining compounds and the feasibility of appropriateness for in vivo testing removed six further compounds (ouabain; omeprazole; esomeprazole; Gleevec; D-LANA-14; and Tasigna).
421,The three most promising compounds (17-DMAG; BGB324; and NCK-8) were further screened for in vivo activity in the guinea pig model of EBOV disease.
422,"Two of the compounds, BGB324 and NCK-8, showed some effect against lethal infection in vivo at the concentrations tested, which warrants further investigation."
423,"Further, these data add to the body of knowledge on the antiviral activities of multiple compounds against EBOV and indicate that the scientific community should invest more effort into the development of novel and specific antiviral compounds to treat Ebola virus disease."
424, The world was struck by surprise when a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in 2003 in China.
425,This disease had never been observed in man before; the SARS-Coronavirus causing the disease was unknown.
426,"With the uncertainty about the future impact of this epidemic, an important international collaboration started spontaneously sharing scientific knowledge and reagents."
427,"Resources became quickly available, and public and private efforts were undertaken to develop rapidly a vaccine."
428,We will discuss here the importance of the international collaboration and the availability of funding.
429,"Moreover, we will review the most important and challenging steps during the industrial development of the SARS vaccine highlighting the difficulties in terms of safety working with such a highly pathogenic, unknown virus."
430,"We will emphasize the industrial perspectives on inactivation and decontamination experiments, the selection of the most promising vaccine candidate, the production process and the choice and use of animal models in such a pressing and difficult situation."
431,"Finally, we will briefly review the unique regulatory environment created during this period for the development of a SARS vaccine."
432, Infectious diseases continue to plague mankind and evolve to keep pace with the efforts to control them.
433,"Sir William Osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, “Humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.” Despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicated—variola virus, the agent of smallpox."
434,"In its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics."
435,"Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the “Black Death” caused by Yersinia pestis in 14th century Europe."
436,"However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases."
437,"Focusing on viruses, a catalog of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time."
438,"However, of the more than 100 virus families, only 22 have been associated with human infections, a number that seems to have plateaued."
439,In the chapter we will concentrate on vaccines for emerging viral diseases.
440,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration, caused by the absence of dystrophin."
441,Exon skipping by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) has recently gained recognition as therapeutic approach in DMD.
442,Conjugation of a peptide to the phosphorodiamidate morpholino backbone (PMO) of ASOs generated the peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) that exhibit a dramatically improved pharmacokinetic profile.
443,"When tested in animal models, PPMOs demonstrate effective exon skipping in target muscles and prolonged duration of dystrophin restoration after a treatment regime."
444,Herein we summarize the main pathophysiological features of DMD and the emergence of PPMOs as promising exon skipping agents aiming to rescue defective gene expression in DMD and other neuromuscular diseases.
445,The listed PPMO laboratory findings correspond to latest trends in the field and highlight the obstacles that must be overcome prior to translating the animal-based research into clinical trials tailored to the needs of patients suffering from neuromuscular diseases.
446,"No specific antivirals are currently available for two emerging infectious diseases, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."
447,"A literature search covering pathogenesis, clinical features and therapeutics, clinically developed drugs for repurposing and novel drug targets was performed."
448,"This review presents current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical features of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses."
449,The rationale for and outcomes with treatments used for SARS and MERS is discussed.
450,The main focus of the review is on drug development and the potential that drugs approved for other indications provide for repurposing.
451,"The drugs we discuss belong to a wide range of different drug classes, such as cancer therapeutics, antipsychotics, and antimalarials."
452,"In addition to their activity against MERS and SARS coronaviruses, many of these approved drugs have broad-spectrum potential and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections."
453,A wealth of knowledge is available for these drugs.
454,"However, the information in this review is not meant to guide clinical decisions, and any therapeutic described here should only be used in context of a clinical trial."
455,Potential targets for novel antivirals and antibodies are discussed as well as lessons learned from treatment development for other RNA viruses.
456,The article concludes with a discussion of the gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research on emerging coronaviruses.
457,Hendra and Nipah viruses are related emergent paramyxoviruses that infect and cause disease in animals and humans.
458,"Disease manifests as a generalized vasculitis affecting multiple organs, but is the most severe in the respiratory and central nervous systems."
459,"The high case fatality and person-to-person transmission associated with the most recent NiV outbreaks, and the recent re-emergence of HeV, emphasize the importance and necessity of effective therapeutics for these novel agents."
460,"In recent years henipavirus research has revealed a more complete understanding of pathogenesis and, as a consequence, viable approaches towards vaccines and therapeutics have emerged."
461,All strategies target early steps in viral replication including receptor binding and membrane fusion.
462,"Animal models have been developed, some of which may prove more valuable than others for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents and regimes."
463,Assessments of protective host immunity and drug pharmacokinetics will be crucial to the further advancement of therapeutic compounds.
464,Food Security within a health security context relates to systems dealing with the prevention and control of not only acute but also sporadic and chronic foodborne diseases.
465,"The description of food security and safety systems in this chapter will hence include oversight of both microbiological and chemical hazards, which both can cause acute as well as chronic disease events."
466,"The Chapter includes a description of existing national and international surveillance systems for foodborne diseases and regulatory systems enabling risk mitigation action for both chemical and microbiological hazards, with specific inclusion of the concerning increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of foodborne microorganisms also related to the animal production systems."
467,The Chapter also includes descriptions of methodology for the quantitative assessment of sustainability of food production systems.
468,": The Ebola virus has been responsible for numerous outbreaks since the 1970s, with the most recent outbreak taking place between 2014 and 2016 and causing an international public health emergency."
469,Ebola virus disease (EVD) has a high mortality rate and no approved targeted treatment exists to date.
470,A number of established drugs are being considered as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of EVD.
471,OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify potential drug repositioning candidates and to assess the scientific evidence available on their efficacy.
472,"METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, and other relevant trial registry platforms for studies published between January 1976 and January 2017."
473,"We included drug screening, preclinical studies, and clinical studies on repurposed drugs for the treatment of EVD."
474,The risk of bias for animal studies and nonrandomized clinical studies was assessed.
475,The quality of reporting for case series and case reports was evaluated.
476,"Finally, we selected drugs approved by established regulatory authorities, which have positive in vitro study outcomes and at least one additional animal or clinical trial."
477,"RESULTS: We identified 3301 publications, of which 37 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria."
478,"Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study type, methodology, and intervention."
479,The risk of bias was high for 13 out of 14 animal studies.
480,We selected 11 drugs with potential anti-EVD therapeutic effects and summarized their evidence.
481,"CONCLUSIONS: Several established drugs may have therapeutic effects on EVD, but the quality and quantity of current scientific evidence is lacking."
482,This review highlights the need for well-designed and conducted preclinical and clinical research to establish the efficacy of potential repurposed drugs against EVD.
483,The demand for nonhuman primates will undoubtedly increase to meet biomedical needs in this current age of biodefense.
484,The availability of funding has increased the research on select agents and has created a requirement to validate results in relevant primate models.
485,This review provides a description of current and potential biological threats that are likely to require nonhuman primates for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.
486,Primates have been an invaluable resource in the dissection of viral disease pathogenesis as well as in testing vaccine efficacy.
487,"DNA vaccine approaches have been studied successfully for Ebola, Lassa, and anthrax in nonhuman primate models."
488,Nonhuman primate research with monkeypox has provided insight into the role of cytokines in limiting disease severity.
489,Biodefense research that has focused on select agents of bacterial origin has also benefited from nonhuman primate studies.
490,Rhesus macaques have traditionally been the model of choice for anthrax research and have yielded successful findings in vaccine development.
491,"In plague research, African green monkeys have contributed to vaccine development."
492,"However, the disadvantages of current vaccines will undoubtedly require the generation of new vaccines, thus increasing the need for nonhuman primate research."
493,"Unfortunately, the current biosafety level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4 facilities equipped to perform this research are limited, which may ultimately impede progress in this era of biodefense."
494,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause severe congenital diseases, such as microcephaly, ocular defects and arthrogryposis in fetuses, and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults."
495,"Efficacious therapeutic treatments for infected patients, as well as prophylactic treatments to prevent new infections are needed for combating ZIKV infection."
496,"Here, we report that ZIKV-specific human polyclonal antibodies (SAB-155), elicited in transchromosomal bovine (TcB), provide significant protection from infection by ZIKV in STAT2 knockout (KO) golden Syrian hamsters both prophylactically and therapeutically."
497,These antibodies also prevent testicular lesions in this hamster model.
498,Our data indicate that antibody-mediated immunotherapy is effective in treating ZIKV infection.
499,"Because suitable quantities of highly potent human polyclonal antibodies can be quickly produced from the TcB system against ZIKV and have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a small animal model, they have the potential as an effective countermeasure against ZIKV infection."
500,Emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
501, The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that resulted in a pandemic in 2003 spurred a flurry of interest in the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the potentially deadly viral infection.
502,Researchers around the world pooled their scientific resources and shared early data in an unprecedented manner in light of the impending public health crisis.
503,There are still large gaps in knowledge about the pathogenesis of this virus.
504,"While significant advances have been made in the development of animal models, the practicality of their use may be hampered by a lack of pathological similarity with human disease."
505,Described here are issues related to progress in vaccine development and the obstacles that lie ahead for both researchers and regulatory agencies.
506,"Today’s world is characterized by increasing population density, human mobility, urbanization, and climate and ecological change."
507,"This global dynamic has various effects, including the increased appearance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), which pose a growing threat to global health security."
508,"Outbreaks of EIDs, like the 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa or the current Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have not only put populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) at risk in terms of morbidity and mortality, but they also have had a significant impact on economic growth in affected regions and beyond."
509,"The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) is an innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations that was launched as the result of a consensus that a coordinated, international, and intergovernmental plan was needed to develop and deploy new vaccines to prevent future epidemics."
510,"CEPI is focusing on supporting candidate vaccines against the World Health Organization (WHO) Blueprint priority pathogens MERS-CoV, Nipah virus, Lassa fever virus, and Rift Valley fever virus, as well as Chikungunya virus, which is on the WHO watch list."
511,"The current vaccine portfolio contains a wide variety of technologies, ranging across recombinant viral vectors, nucleic acids, and recombinant proteins."
512,"To support and accelerate vaccine development, CEPI will also support science projects related to the development of biological standards and assays, animal models, epidemiological studies, and diagnostics, as well as build capacities for future clinical trials in risk-prone contexts."
513,The domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has been a long-standing animal model used in the evaluation and treatment of human diseases.
514,"Molecular imaging techniques such as 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) would be an invaluable method of tracking disease in vivo, but this technique has not been reported in the literature."
515,"Thus, the aim of this study was to establish baseline imaging characteristics of PET/computed tomography (CT) with (18)F-FDG in the ferret model."
516,Twelve healthy female ferrets were anesthetized and underwent combined PET/CT scanning.
517,"After the images were fused, volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated in the liver, heart, thymus, and bilateral lung fields."
518,"For each VOI, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated."
519,"Additional comparisons were made between radiotracer uptake periods (60, 90, and >90 minutes), intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of (18)F-FDG, and respiratory gated and ungated acquisitions."
520,Pulmonary structures and the surrounding thoracic and upper abdominal anatomy were readily identified on the CT scans of all ferrets and were successfully fused with PET.
521,"VOIs were created in various tissues with the following SUV calculations: heart (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV(Max)] 8.60, mean standardized uptake value [SUV(Mean)] 5.42), thymus (SUV(Max) 3.86, SUV(Mean) 2.59), liver (SUV(Max) 1.37, SUV(Mean) 0.99), right lung (SUV(Max) 0.92, SUV(Mean) 0.56), and left lung (SUV(Max) 0.88, SUV(Mean) 0.51)."
522,Sixty- to 90-minute uptake periods were sufficient to separate tissues based on background SUV activity.
523,No gross differences in image quality were seen between intraperitoneal and intravenous injections of (18)F-FDG.
524,Respiratory gating also did not have a significant impact on image quality of lung parenchyma.
525,The authors concluded that (18)F-FDG PET and CT imaging can be performed successfully in normal healthy ferrets with the parameters identified in this study.
526,They obtained similar imaging features and uptake measurements with and without respiratory gating as well as with intraperitoneal and intravenous (18)F-FDG injections.
527,(18)F-FDG PET and CT can be a valuable resource for the in vivo tracking of disease progression in future studies that employ the ferret model.
528,"Infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality in suckling pigs."
529,Contaminated feed has been suggested as a vehicle of transmission for PEDV.
530,"The objective of this study was to compare thermal and electron beam processing, and the inclusion of feed additives on the inactivation of PEDV in feed."
531,Feed samples were spiked with PEDV and then heated to 120–145°C for up to 30 min or irradiated at 0–50 kGy.
532,"Another set of feed samples spiked with PEDV and mixed with Ultracid P (Nutriad), Activate DA (Novus International), KEM-GEST (Kemin Agrifood), Acid Booster (Agri-Nutrition), sugar or salt was incubated at room temperature (~25°C) for up to 21 days."
533,"At the end of incubation, the virus titers were determined by inoculation of Vero-81 cells and the virus inactivation kinetics were modeled using the Weibull distribution model."
534,The Weibull kinetic parameter delta represented the time or eBeam dose required to reduce virus concentration by 1 log.
535,"For thermal processing, delta values ranged from 16.52 min at 120°C to 1.30 min at 145°C."
536,"For eBeam processing, a target dose of 50 kGy reduced PEDV concentration by 3 log."
537,All additives tested were effective in reducing the survival of PEDV when compared with the control sample (delta = 17.23 days).
538,Activate DA (0.81) and KEM-GEST (3.28) produced the fastest inactivation.
539,"In conclusion, heating swine feed at temperatures over 130°C or eBeam processing of feed with a dose over 50 kGy are effective processing steps to reduce PEDV survival."
540,"Additionally, the inclusion of selected additives can decrease PEDV survivability."
541,The interface of animal and human vaccines
542," Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are an expanding global threat to public health, security, and economies."
543,"Increasing populations, urbanization, deforestation, climate change, anti-vaccination movements, war, and international travel are some of the contributing factors to this trend."
544,"The recent Ebola, MERS-CoV, and Zika outbreaks demonstrated we are insufficiently prepared to respond with proven safe and effective countermeasures (i.e., vaccines and therapeutics)."
545,"The State University of New York Upstate Medical University and the Trudeau Institute convened a summit of key opinion and thought leaders in the life sciences and biomedical research and development enterprises to explore global biopreparedness challenges, take an inventory of existing capabilities and capacities related to preparation and response, assess current “gaps,” and prospect what could be done to improve our position."
546,"Herein we describe the summit proceedings, “Translational Immunology Supporting Biomedical Countermeasure Development for Emerging Vector-borne Viral Diseases,” held October 2–3, 2018, at the Trudeau Institute in Saranac Lake, NY."
547,Animal models to study opiates are of growing interest.
548,We have examined the short-term safety of buprenorphine implants in Fischer F344/NTac rats treated with excess doses of a cholesterol-triglyceride suspension of buprenorphine.
549,A single injection of 0.65 mg/kg afforded clinically significant blood levels of analgesia for 3 days.
550,"Chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis values with 2- to 10-fold excess doses of the drug-lipid suspension were within normal limits."
551,Histopathology findings were unremarkable.
552,The skin and underlying tissue surrounding the drug injection were unremarkable.
553,Here we report the results of a long-term follow-up study of female rats injected with 0.65 and 1.3 mg/kg.
554,The 14-month evaluation showed no abnormal findings that could be attributed to the drug or lipid suspension.
555,These results confirm the safety of cholesterol-triglyceride carrier systems for subcutaneous drug delivery in laboratory animals and suggest that this model may be used to study long-term effects of opiate therapy.
556,The recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) highlights the need to engineer new methods for expediting vaccine development against emerging diseases.
557,"However, several obstacles prevent pursuit of a licensable MERS vaccine."
558,"First, the lack of a suitable animal model for MERS complicates in vivo testing of candidate vaccines."
559,"Second, due to the low number of MERS cases, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to pursue MERS vaccine production as the costs of clinical trials are high."
560,"In addition, the timeline from bench research to approved vaccine use is 10 years or longer."
561,"Using novel methods and cost-saving strategies, genetically engineered vaccines can be produced quickly and cost-effectively."
562,"Along with progress in MERS animal model development, these obstacles can be circumvented or at least mitigated."
563,"Despite major advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin the development of diabetic kidney disease, current best practice still leaves a significant proportion of patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy."
564,This is on a background of an increasing diabetes epidemic worldwide.
565,Although kidney failure is a major cause of morbidity the main cause of death remains cardiovascular in nature.
566,"Hence, diabetic therapies which are both “cardio-renal” protective seem the logical way forward."
567,"In this review, we discuss the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (DPP4inh), which are glucose-lowering agents used clinically and their role in diabetic kidney disease with specific focus on renoprotection and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease."
568,We highlight the novel pleiotropic effects of DPP4 that make it an attractive additional target to combat the fibrotic and inflammatory pathways in diabetic kidney disease and also discuss the current literature on the cardiovascular safety profile of DPP4inh.
569,"Clearly, these observed renoprotective effects will need to be confirmed by clinical trials to determine whether they translate into beneficial effects to patients with diabetes."
570,Liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) is a critical issue in drug discovery and development.
571,Standard preclinical evaluation of drug hepatotoxicity is generally performed using in vivo animal systems.
572,"However, only a small number of preselected compounds can be examined in vivo due to high experimental costs."
573,A more efficient yet accurate screening technique which can identify potentially hepatotoxic compounds in the early stages of drug development would thus be valuable.
574,"Here, we develop and apply a novel genomic prediction technique for screening hepatotoxic compounds based on in vitro human liver cell tests."
575,"Using a training set of in vivo rodent experiments for drug hepatotoxicity evaluation, we discovered common biomarkers of drug-induced liver toxicity among six heterogeneous compounds."
576,This gene set was further triaged to a subset of 32 genes that can be used as a multi-gene expression signature to predict hepatotoxicity.
577,This multi-gene predictor was independently validated and showed consistently high prediction performance on five test sets of in vitro human liver cell and in vivo animal toxicity experiments.
578,The predictor also demonstrated utility in evaluating different degrees of toxicity in response to drug concentrations which may be useful not only for discerning a compound’s general hepatotoxicity but also for determining its toxic concentration.
579,"The Vaccine Research Center has developed vaccine candidates for different diseases/infectious agents (including HIV-1, Ebola, and Marburg viruses) built on an adenovirus vector platform, based on adenovirus type 5 or 35."
580,"To support clinical development of each vaccine candidate, pre-clinical studies were performed in rabbits to determine where in the body they biodistribute and how rapidly they clear, and to screen for potential toxicities (intrinsic and immunotoxicities)."
581,"The vaccines biodistribute only to spleen, liver (Ad5 only), and/or iliac lymph node (Ad35 only) and otherwise remain in the site of injection muscle and overlying subcutis."
582,"Though ∼10(11) viral particles were inoculated, already by Day 9, all but 10(3) to 10(5) genome copies per μg of DNA had cleared from the injection site muscle."
583,"By three months, the adenovector was cleared with, at most, a few animals retaining a small number of copies in the injection site, spleen (Ad5), or iliac lymph node (Ad35)."
584,"This pattern of limited biodistribution and extensive clearance is consistent regardless of differences in adenovector type (Ad5 or 35), manufacturer's construct and production methods, or gene-insert."
585,"Repeated dose toxicology studies identified treatment-related toxicities confined primarily to the sites of injection, in certain clinical pathology parameters, and in body temperatures (Ad5 vectors) and food consumption immediately post-inoculation."
586,Systemic reactogenicity and reactogenicity at the sites of injection demonstrated reversibility.
587,These data demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of Ad5 or Ad35 adenovector-based vaccine candidates at doses of up to 2 × 10(11) given intramuscularly to prevent various infectious diseases.
588,Introduction: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an important emerging respiratory pathogen.
589,MERS-CoV resulted in multiple hospital outbreaks within and outside the Arabian Peninsula.
590,"The disease has a high case fatality rate, with the need for a therapeutic option."
591,"Areas covered: In this review, we provide an overview of the progress in the development of therapeutic strategies for MERS."
592,"We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the following terms: ‘MERS’, ‘MERS-CoV’, ‘Middle East respiratory syndrome’ in combination with ‘treatment’ or ‘therapy’."
593,Expert commentary: There are multiple agents tried in vitro and in vivo.
594,None of these agents were used in large clinical studies.
595,Available clinical studies are limited to the use of the combination of interferon and other agents.
596,These clinical studies are based solely on case reports and case series.
597,There are no prospective or randomized trials.
598,There is a need to have prospective and randomized clinical trials for the therapy of MERS-CoV.
599,"However, this strategy might be hampered by the sporadic cases outside the large hospital outbreaks."
600," Immunity to targeted infectious diseases may be conferred or enhanced by vaccines, which are manufactured from recombinant forms as well as inactivated or attenuated organisms."
601,"These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality, and efficacy."
602,"In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response."
603,"To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies."
604,"There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology."
605,"If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly."
606,"Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response."
607,"Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety."
608,The common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the Callitrichidae family weighing between 350 and 400g.
609,"The marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding model for studying aging, reproduction, neuroscience, toxicology, and infectious disease."
610,"With regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents, they are exquisite NHP models for viral, protozoan and bacterial agents, as well as prions."
611,"The marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and susceptibility to wild type, non-adapted viruses."
612,Preclinical investigations such as animal modeling make the basis of clinical investigations and subsequently patient care.
613,"Predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) not only highlights a patient-tailored approach by choosing the right medication, the right dose at the right time point but it as well essentially requires early identification, by the means of complex and state-of-the-art technologies of unmanifested pathological processes in an individual, in order to deliver targeted prevention early enough to reverse manifestation of a pathology."
614,"Such an approach can be achieved by taking into account clinical, pathological, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics of the patients or an individual who has a suboptimal health condition."
615,"Inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, in this context, may diminish the predictive potential and slow down the development of PPPM and consequently modern healthcare."
616,"Therefore, it is the common goal of PPPM and translational medicine to find the solution for the problem we present in our review."
617,"Both, translational medicine and PPPM in parallel, essentially need accurate surrogates for misleading animal models."
618,This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models.
619,Limitations of current animal models and drug development strategies based on animal modeling have been systematically discussed.
620,"Finally, a variety of potential surrogates have been suggested to change the unfavorable situation in medical research and consequently in healthcare."
621,"Public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(1,2,3,4,5), but concerns remain over the possibility of future recurrences."
622,Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority.
623,"Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model."
624,Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization.
625,"These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
626,"Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies."
627,"Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism."
628,Gene-based vaccination for the SARS-CoV elicits effective immune responses that generate protective immunity in an animal model.
629,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature02463) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
630,Plant-made vaccines are now a well-established and well-tested concept in veterinary medicine—yet the only product so far licenced was never produced commercially.
631,"This is puzzling, given the breadth of exploration of plant-made animal vaccines, and their immunogenicity and efficacy, over more than twenty years of research."
632,"The range of candidate vaccines that have been tested in laboratory animal models includes vaccines for E. coli, Salmonella, Yersinia pestis, foot and mouth disease virus, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, rabbit and canine and bovine papillomaviruses, mink enteritis and porcine circovirus, and lately also bluetongue virus, among many others."
633,"There are many proofs of efficacy of such vaccines, and regulatory pathways appear to have been explored for their licencing."
634,"This review will briefly explore the history of plant-made vaccines for use in animals, and will discuss the unique advantages of plant-made vaccines for use in a veterinary medicine setting in detail, with a proposal of their relevance within the “One Health” paradigm."
635,Nipah virus (NiV) causes a severe and often fatal neurological disease in humans.
636,"Whilst fruit bats are considered the natural reservoir, NiV also infects pigs and may cause an unapparent or mild disease."
637,"Direct pig-to-human transmission was responsible for the first and still most devastating NiV outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998–99, with nearly 300 human cases and over 100 fatalities."
638,Pigs can therefore play a key role in the epidemiology of NiV by acting as an “amplifying” host.
639,The outbreak in Singapore ended with the prohibition of pig imports from Malaysia and the Malaysian outbreak was ended by culling 45% of the country's pig population with costs exceeding US$500 million.
640,"Despite the importance of NiV as an emerging disease with the potential for pandemic, no vaccines, or therapeutics are currently approved for human or livestock use."
641,"In this mini-review, we will discuss current knowledge of NiV infection in pigs; our ongoing work to develop a NiV vaccine for use in pigs; and the pig as a model to support human vaccine development."
642,"Emerging and re-emerging pathogens represent a substantial threat to public health, as demonstrated with numerous outbreaks over the past years, including the 2013–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus in western Africa."
643,"Coronaviruses are also a threat for humans, as evidenced in 2002/2003 with infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused more than 8000 human infections with 10% fatality rate in 37 countries."
644,"Ten years later, a novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
645,"Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35% fatality rate."
646,Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.
647,Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology of the disease.
648,Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range.
649,"In this paper, experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed."
650,Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral pathogenesis and transmission studies.
651,"Finally, the relevance of potential new target species is discussed."
652,Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a crucial intracellular second messenger molecule that converts extracellular molecules to intracellular signal transduction pathways generating cell- and stimulus-specific effects.
653,"Importantly, specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) subtypes control the amplitude and duration of cAMP-induced physiological processes and are therefore a prominent pharmacological target currently used in a variety of fields."
654,"Here we tested the extracts from traditional Chinese medicine, Forsythia suspense seeds, which have been used for more than 2000 years to relieve respiratory symptoms."
655,"Using structural-functional analysis we found its major lignin, Forsynthin, acted as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting PDE4 in inflammatory and immune cell."
656,"Moreover, several novel, selective small molecule derivatives of Forsythin were tested in vitro and in murine models of viral and bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and cytokine-driven systemic inflammation."
657,"Thus, pharmacological targeting of PDE4 may be a promising strategy for immune-related disorders characterized by amplified host inflammatory response."
658,Antiviral compounds were evaluated for efficacy against yellow fever virus (YFV) in a hamster model of YFV-induced liver disease.
659,Challenge with a 10(2) 50% cell culture infectious doses of YFV resulted in a 50–80% mortality rate in female hamsters.
660,"Virus was detected by QRT-PCR in liver, kidney, spleen, and serum with peak titers on 4–6 days post-viral challenge (dpi)."
661,"Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and creatinine were significantly elevated, while serum levels of albumin, amylase, glucose, calcium, globulin, phosphorus, sodium, and total protein were significantly reduced."
662,Packed cell volume and white blood cell count were significantly elevated during the course of the infection.
663,"Intraperitoneal treatment of hamsters with 0.5–5 μg/kg/d interferon (IFN) alfacon-1, 100 mg/kg/d viramidine, or 50 mg/kg/d ribavirin, initiated 4 h prior to YFV challenge, resulted in significant improvement in survival and serum ALT levels."
664,"Treatment with IFN alfacon-1 or ribavirin starting 2 dpi, also significantly improved survival and serum ALT levels in hamsters challenged with YFV."
665,Pre- and post-virus exposure treatment with IFN alfacon-1 was efficacious in improving disease in YFV-infected hamsters.
666,"Several arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease with case-fatality rates in hospitalized individuals ranging from 15-30%."
667,"Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens."
668,Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-α) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal.
669,"However, while cIFN-α has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production."
670,"To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replication-deficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-α, for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters."
671,Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichindé virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease.
672,A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge.
673,DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure.
674,"The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-α, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge."
675,"Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections."
676,The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.
677, Full evaluation of the interactions between a virus and host during infection and clearance requires a living organism.
678,A live animal is also necessary for development of vaccines requiring evaluation of immunogenicity and an immune response that protects from challenge.
679,"Study of the natural host for the virus is ideal, but often not possible."
680,"Mice have emerged over the last 60 years as the most popular animal model for studying viral pathogenesis due to extensive genetic and immunologic characterization, wide availability of reagents, inbred and transgenic strains, and small size."
681,"However, responses in mice are not always predictive of those in the natural host."
682,"Other species commonly used include guinea pigs, ferrets, chickens, and nonhuman primates."
683,"When choosing an animal model for a study, factors to be considered include host susceptibility to the infection, animal size, cost, availability of housing and reagents, potential confounding coinfections, and ethical restrictions."
684,The devastating Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa in 2013–2016 has flagged the need for the timely development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens.
685,"To be better prepared for new epidemics, the WHO has compiled a list of priority pathogens that are likely to cause future outbreaks and for which R&D efforts are, therefore, paramount (R&D Blueprint: https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/)."
686,"To this end, the detailed characterization of vaccine platforms is needed."
687,The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been established as a robust vaccine vector backbone for infectious diseases for well over a decade.
688,The recent clinical trials testing the vaccine candidate VSV-EBOV against EBOV disease now have added a substantial amount of clinical data and suggest VSV to be an ideal vaccine vector candidate for outbreak pathogens.
689,"In this review, we discuss insights gained from the clinical VSV-EBOV vaccine trials as well as from animal studies investigating vaccine candidates for Blueprint pathogens."
690,"To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus."
691,"Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS."
692,"However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns."
693,We then applied the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates.
694,"By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion."
695,"The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity."
696,"Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation."
697,"The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals."
698,"The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein."
699,"By applying reverse vaccinology and machine learning, we predicted potential vaccine targets for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development."
700,"We then propose that an ""Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine"" containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses."
701,"SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019 in China."
702,"It has since infected more than 870,000 individuals and caused more than 43,000 deaths globally."
703,"Here, we discuss therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges."
704,Vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic.
705,"Nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses."
706,"Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population."
707,"The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly in China, and has developed to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern."
708,"However, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available yet."
709,This work aims to share strategies and candidate antigens to develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
710,"The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide."
711,Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades.
712,"However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS."
713,"Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies."
714,"Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection."
715,"This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection."
716,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a public health emergency of international concern declared by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
717,"An immuno-informatics approach along with comparative genomic was applied to design a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E proteins."
718,"The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced bioinformatics tools."
719,The candidate vaccine showed an average of ≥ 90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups.
720,Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding.
721,Immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2.
722,It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased INF-γ and IL-2 cytokines.
723,The codon optimization and mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed the chimera is suitable for high-level expression and cloning.
724,"Overall, the constructed recombinant chimeric vaccine candidate demonstrated significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global threat, COVID-19."
725," Background Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19."
726,"SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively."
727,Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed.
728,"The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection."
729,Methods We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure.
730,"In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design."
731,"We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays."
732,"Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines."
733,Findings Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity.
734,"Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses."
735,"Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence."
736,"Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization."
737,Interpretation MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection.
738,Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics.
739,Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses.
740,"Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases."
741,Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: Is the genie already out of the bottle?
742," On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
743,"As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries."
744,"Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency."
745,"Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection."
746,"On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China."
747,The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
748,Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses.
749,"As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths."
750,"As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare."
751,"Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan."
752,"Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence."
753,"While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant."
754,Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic.
755,"There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?"
756,What is the animal reservoir?
757,Is there an intermediate animal reservoir?
758,Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV?
759,We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines.
760,We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.
761,Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/laboratory-diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus.
762,"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe."
763,"Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines."
764,"To support the current research and development, CAS has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the CAS content collection."
765,It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication.
766,The drug-repurposing effort documented herein focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
767,"The patent analysis of coronavirus-related biologics includes therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines."
768,"More than 500 patents disclose methodologies of these four biologics with the potential for treating and preventing coronavirus infections, which may be applicable to COVID-19."
769,The information included in this report provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines.
770,Information about the open-access article 'Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019nCoV' in DOAJ.
771,"DOAJ is an online directory that indexes and provides access to quality open access, peer-reviewed journals."
772,Novel coronavirus is putting the whole world on alert
773,The missing pieces in the jigsaw and need for cohesive research amidst COVID 19 global response
774,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China and spread around the world."
775,"Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir."
776,"The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely."
777,There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19.
778,"However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery."
779,"In the current review, we summarize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection and previous human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
780,We also discuss the approaches for developing effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to cope with this viral outbreak.
781,"With sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the global health community has been able to record a great number of recovered population."
782,"Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E_0 ) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R_0=0 for and endemic situation."
783,"Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B=0."
784,"Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally."
785,Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.
786,A glimpse into the origins of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2
787,"Coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory, enteric and systemic infections in a wide range of hosts including man, mammals, fish, and avian."
788,The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV).
789,"This decade’s first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’ on January 30(th), 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
790,"As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines)."
791,"In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries."
792,The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin.
793,The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus.
794,The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well.
795,The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.
796,"ABSTRACTNovel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort."
797,This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome.
798,"Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts."
799,The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development.
800,"This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events."
801,"Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution."
802,"Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017."
803,"Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population."
804,These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine.
805,Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans.
806,Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.
807,The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the epidemic potential of coronaviruses.
808,The rapid spread of this virus across the world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause.
809,We highlight the current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
810," In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern."
811,SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
812,"Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days."
813,"Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients."
814,"This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19."
815,"Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article."
816,"In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed."
817,"As of early March, 2019-nCoV has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives."
818,2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV.
819,No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus.
820,Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties.
821,These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies.
822,"We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506)."
823,"Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations."
824,These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02).
825,No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain.
826,"Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate."
827,We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread.
828,There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes).
829,"Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure."
830,"We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses."
831,"Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion."
832,Our computational pipeline is validated with experimental data from SARS-CoV.
833,Identification of potential cross-protective epitope between a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus
834,This study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability.
835,This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures.
836,"Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R_0<1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure."
837,"The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment."
838,Puzzle of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (2019-nCoV)
839,"In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries)."
840,"The disease is officially named as the Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable communicable disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health."
841,SSCP is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%) mortality rate.
842,Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of stringent infection control or no proper personal protective equipment available.
843,"Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under investigation."
844,"To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of travel or contact history for patients with compatible symptoms."
845,"In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries)."
846,"The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020)."
847,"It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category."
848,COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate.
849,"Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers."
850,"Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation."
851,"To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms."
852,We study a novel multi-strain SIR epidemic model with selective immunity by vaccination.
853,A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilibrium.
854,"We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain."
855,"Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population."
856,We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability.
857,The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium.
858,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has aroused a global alert.
859,"To release social panic and guide future schedules, this article proposes a novel mathematical model, the Delay Differential Epidemic Analyzer (D(2)EA), to analyze the dynamics of epidemic and forecast its future trends."
860,"Based on the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the D(2)EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states."
861,Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture.
862,"In the experiment part, we use the D(2)EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province."
863,"Fitting to the collected real data as non-linear optimization, the D(2)EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down."
864,We also evaluate the effectiveness of the quarantine measures and schedule the date to reopen Hubei Province.
865,"Objective: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) has advanced into 197 countries and territories leaving behind a total of 372,757 confirmed cases and 16231 deaths."
866,"Methods: One the basis of WHO situation reports data of COVID-19 along with daily official reports from the Japan, China and the Korea we modeled the spread of COVID19 by using the Successive Approximation Method."
867,We defined the two state of data to find the mean ratio (η) of the present cases count to the sum of previous and present cases.
868,This ratio further predicts the future state of COVID-19 pandemic.
869,"Results: The mean ratio (η) of expected cases were found 0.485, while the mean ratio for deaths was found to be 0.49."
870,We calculated worldwide expected lower bound value for confirmed cases 247007 cases with maximum limit of 1667719 cases and minimum deaths count 8660 with upper limit of 117397 deaths in next 30 days.
871,"While in the case of Iran, a large increase in the number of deaths are expected in the upcoming 30 days with lower bound value of 1140 deaths and maximum value of 598478 deaths."
872,Interpretation: Iran whole population is on risk.
873,Human coronaviruses continue to pose a threat to human health.
874,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century."
875,This recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus in China leads to huge impacts on humans globally.
876,Covid-19 is a challenge to global public health.
877,"Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in a one health context, highlighting the need for the implementation of one health measures and practices to improve human health and reduce the emergence of pandemic viruses."
878,Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority.
879,"Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time."
880,"A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies."
881,"Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure."
882,It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19.
883,It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation.
884,"Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves."
885,"Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days."
886,"In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days."
887,"In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration."
888,"Conclusions: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings."
889,We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.
890,"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China in December 2019."
891,"The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus."
892,"Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002–2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts."
893,Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly.
894,"We know that SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio."
895,"The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control."
896,"While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of “superspreading” events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in Australia, across five jurisdictions."
897,"Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world."
898,"However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead."
899,"Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non‐Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insig​htplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coron​avirus-no-place-for-racism-xenop​hobia/)."
900,"Since late 2019 the world is facing the rapid spreading of a novel viral disease (SARS-CoV-2) provoked by the coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19), declared pandemic last 12 March 2020."
901,"As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide."
902,"In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate."
903,"In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections."
904,"Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease."
905,System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems.
906,The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures.
907,"The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA® from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios."
908,"Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions."
909,"We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities."
910,"First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped."
911,"The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply."
912,"Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient."
913,"High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19."
914,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice."
915,"Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation."
916,"In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted."
917,The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated.
918,"Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine."
919,"Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority."
920,Mental health and a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China
921,"The rapid global spread of the novel, pathogenic, SARS-CoV-2 causing the severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19, becomes a major health problem worldwide and pose the need for international predictive programs."
922,"Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated in the social scene."
923,"Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by bioclimatic variables."
924,The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions.
925,"Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia."
926,"Our approach may, therefore, be of value for the incorporation of climatic influences in the design and implementation of public health policies."
927,Maps are available (constantly updated) at https://navaak.shinyapps.io/CVRisk/.
928,"An emerging coronavirus causing pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China: calling for developing therapeutic and prophylactic strategies"
929,A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world.
930,"Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV."
931,Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs.
932,Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
933,"Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2."
934,"Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2."
935,"Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority."
936,Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary.
937,"For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human."
938,"The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2."
939,"In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites."
940,More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains.
941,"These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage."
942,The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work.
943,"Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution."
944,The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.
945,"A novel type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting humans appeared in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019."
946,"Since the identification of the outbreak the infection quickly spread involving in one month more than 31,000 confirmed cases with 638 death."
947,"Molecular analysis suggest that 2019-nCoV could be originated from bats after passaging in intermediate hosts, highlighting the high zoonotic potential of coronaviruses."
948,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging human infectious coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11(th)."
949,There is still no vaccine or definitive treatment for this virus because its pathogenesis and proliferation pathways are still unknown.
950,"Therefore, in this article, new potential COVID-19 therapies are briefly reviewed."
951,"An outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan and spread globally."
952,"Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering."
953,"However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection”."
954,The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study.
955,"We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection."
956,"After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain."
957,"Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys."
958,"Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge."
959,"Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design."
960,ABSTRACTThe respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019.
961,"This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago."
962,Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces.
963,It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV.
964,"However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control."
965,"To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method."
966,"Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently."
967,We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system.
968,"Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body."
969,"Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS."
970,"Many countries have applied lockdown to suppress COVID-19, with devastating economic consequences."
971,"Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that suppress the epidemic and provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity."
972,"We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants that can be adapted in response to epidemiological observations, can in certain conditions suppress the epidemic while providing part-time employment."
973,The cycle reduces the reproduction number R by a combination of reduced exposure time and a resonance effect where those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days.
974,"Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing and extensive testing and contact tracing."
975,Adaptive work-lockdown cycles can provide epidemic control and offer predictability to many economic sectors.
976,In this work we propose a data-driven age-structured census-based SIRD-like epidemiological model capable of forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil.
977,We model the current scenario of closed schools and universities and voluntary home quarantine to show that it is still not enough to protect the health system by explicitly computing the demand for hospital intensive care unit beds.
978,"We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid the collapse of the health system and, consequently, to minimize the quantity of deaths."
979,"On the other hand, we demonstrate that the relaxation of the already imposed control measures in the next days would be catastrophic."
980,"In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 originating from Wuhan, China, has become pandemic."
981,Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model.
982,"The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE."
983,"These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient β describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(α,t) with α = lnβ."
984,"The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals."
985,"In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1."
986,"Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases."
987,"In contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, Italian provinces on February 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rC/rE and corresponding decrease of β from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth."
988,"Even higher reduction should take place in France, Germany and Spain for which β > 1.3 (as of March 10, 2020)."
989,"Considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which rE decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves."
990,"In such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years."
991,"This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine."
992,A recent manuscript (Ferguson et al.
993,"in Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand, Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, London, 2020. https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) from Imperial College modelers examining ways to mitigate and control the spread of COVID-19 has attracted much attention."
994,"In this paper, we will discuss a coarse taxonomy of models and explore the context and significance of the Imperial College and other models in contributing to the analysis of COVID-19."
995,Science in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease
996, This study investigates the propagation power and effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in light of published data.
997,"We examine the factors affecting COVID-19 together with the spatial effects, and use spatial panel data models to determine the relationship among the variables including their spatial effects."
998,"Using spatial panel models, we analyse the relationship between confirmed cases of COVID-19, deaths thereof, and recovered cases due to treatment."
999,We accordingly determine and include the spatial effects in this examination after establishing the appropriate model for COVID-19.
1000,The most efficient and consistent model is interpreted with direct and indirect spatial effects.
1001,Investigating hypothiocyanite against SARS-CoV-2
1002,"Emergence of a novel coronavirus causing respiratory illness from Wuhan, China"
1003,"Data as of March 29, 2020 show that the flattening strategy for COVID-19 in the U.S. is working so well that a clean removal of social distancing (aka unlock) at any time in 2020 will produce a renewed catastrophe, overloading the healthcare system."
1004,Leaving the economy locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe.
1005,"An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which learns disease spread characteristics rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock."
1006,"Case load can be managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning of implementation."
1007,The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week.
1008,"Given that not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial unlock might be 5 full working days per week."
1009,"The model can be regionalized easily, and by expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the U.S. medical equipment and volunteers, many of them with already acquired immunity, can be made available to other countries."
1010,COVID-19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country.
1011,"Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease."
1012,"According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes."
1013,Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic.
1014,"In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks."
1015,SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020 to 30th March 2020.
1016,The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model.
1017,The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01.
1018,"Also, the value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02."
1019,Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time.
1020,This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks.
1021,"Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals."
1022,[Image: see text] The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent need for therapeutics.
1023,"Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, was found to be effective against various viral infections with nanomolar to micromolar potency such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, ZIKV, HCV, and human adenovirus, indicating its potential as an antiviral agent."
1024,"In this brief review, we summarize the broad antiviral activity of niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use in the treatment of COVID-19."
1025,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency.
1026,"Here we highlight nine most important research questions concerning virus transmission, asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, origin of virus and viral pathogenesis."
1027,A discrete-time deterministic epidemic model is proposed with the aim of reproducing the behaviour observed in the incidence of real infectious diseases.
1028,"For this purpose, we analyse a SIRS model under the framework of a small world network formulation."
1029,"Using this model, we make predictions about the peak of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy."
1030,"A Gaussian fit is also performed, to make a similar prediction."
1031," There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020."
1032,Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency.
1033,"At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities."
1034,This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation.
1035,"This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus."
1036,The novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a one health issue
1037,Outbreak of COVID-19 – an urgent need for good science to silence our fears?
1038,Mass gathering events and reducing further global spread of COVID-19: a political and public health dilemma
1039,"One world, one health: The novel coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic"
1040,"COVID-19 data from India is compared against several countries as well as key states in the US with a major outbreak, and it is found that the basic reproduction number R_0 for India is in the expected range of 1.4-3.9."
1041,"Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California."
1042,Exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis.
1043,"Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000."
1044,"However, this estimation will be invalid if India enters the stage of community transmission."
1045,"The impact of social distancing, again with the assumption of no community transmission, is also assessed by comparing data from different geographical locations."
1046,: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control.
1047,"Because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated."
1048,Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease.
1049,"DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein."
1050,Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated IM on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56.
1051,"On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology."
1052,RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses.
1053,Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV.
1054,"All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all."
1055,"Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains."
1056,The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence.
1057,CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV.
1058,"However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced."
1059,Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.
1060,Viral vaccines have had remarkable positive impacts on human health as well as the health of domestic animal populations.
1061,"Despite impressive vaccine successes, however, many infectious diseases cannot yet be efficiently controlled or eradicated through vaccination, often because it is impossible to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population."
1062,Recent advances in molecular biology suggest that the centuries-old method of individual-based vaccine delivery may be on the cusp of a major revolution.
1063,"Specifically, genetic engineering brings to life the possibility of a live, transmissible vaccine."
1064,"Unfortunately, releasing a highly transmissible vaccine poses substantial evolutionary risks, including reversion to high virulence as has been documented for the oral polio vaccine."
1065,"An alternative, and far safer approach, is to rely on genetically engineered and weakly transmissible vaccines that have reduced scope for evolutionary reversion."
1066,"Here, we use mathematical models to evaluate the potential efficacy of such weakly transmissible vaccines."
1067,Our results demonstrate that vaccines with even a modest ability to transmit can significantly lower the incidence of infectious disease and facilitate eradication efforts.
1068,"Consequently, weakly transmissible vaccines could provide an important tool for controlling infectious disease in wild and domestic animal populations and for reducing the risks of emerging infectious disease in humans."
1069, Zika virus outbreaks have been explosive and unpredictable and have led to significant adverse health effects—as well as considerable public anxiety.
1070,"Significant scientific work has resulted in multiple candidate vaccines that are now undergoing further clinical development, with several vaccines now in phase 2 clinical trials."
1071,"In this review, we survey current vaccine efforts, preclinical and clinical results, and ethical and other concerns that directly bear on vaccine development."
1072,It is clear that the world needs safe and effective vaccines to protect against Zika virus infection.
1073,"Whether such vaccines can be developed through to licensure and public availability absent significant financial investment by countries, and other barriers discussed within this article, remains uncertain."
1074, We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine; a combination of the DNA vaccines expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope and –liposome (HSP65+IL-12/HVJ).
1075,This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse model compared to the BCG.
1076,This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) in murine models.
1077,"Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis."
1078,This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality.
1079,The BCG prime and HSP65+IL-12/HVJ vaccine (boost) by the prime-boost method showed a synergistic prophylactic effect in the monkey.
1080,"Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys.HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine increased the body weight of TB-infected monkeys, improved the ESR, and augmented the immuneresponses (proliferation of PBL and IL-2 production)."
1081,The enhancement of IL-2 production from monkeys treated with this vaccine was correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine.
1082,These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.
1083,"Various types of vaccines are under pre-clinical and clinical development to address the recent appearance of Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS, an emerging infectious disease that has already caused over 600 deaths and remains a threat to world health."
1084,"The causative agent for this respiratory disease is a member of the betacoronavirus genus, phylogenetically closely related to the SARS coronavirus that caused an international health emergency in 2002."
1085,"With lessons learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and with undeniable technological advances, vaccine development against MERS was initially fast-paced and has produced several DNA and protein vaccine candidates with promising results during early pre-clinical testing."
1086,At least one vaccine candidate has even entered first-in-humans clinical trials now.
1087,"With the number of MERS cases declining though and other infectious diseases attracting increased attention, the question remains, whether, similar to the situation after the SARS pandemic, vaccine development is halted or remains the priority it rightfully should."
1088, This review focuses on the immunization of animals as a means of preventing human diseases (zoonoses).
1089,"Three frameworks for the use of vaccines in this context are described, and examples are provided of successes and failures."
1090,"Framework I vaccines are used for protection of humans and economically valuable animals, where neither plays a role in the transmission cycle."
1091,"The benefit of collaborations between animal health and human health industries and regulators in developing such products is discussed, and one example (West Nile vaccine) of a single product developed for use in animals and humans is described."
1092,Framework II vaccines are indicated for domesticated animals as a means of preventing disease in both animals and humans.
1093,The agents of concern are transmitted directly or indirectly (e.g.
1094,via arthropod vectors) from animals to humans.
1095,"A number of examples of the use of Framework II vaccines are provided, e.g."
1096,"against brucellosis, Escherischia coli O157, rabies, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Hendra virus."
1097,Framework III vaccines are used to immunize wild animals as a means of preventing transmission of disease agents to humans and domesticated animals.
1098,"Examples are reservoir-targeted, oral bait rabies, Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines."
1099,"Given the speed and lost cost of veterinary vaccine development, some interventions based on the immunization of animals could lead to rapid and relatively inexpensive advances in public health."
1100,Opportunities for vaccine-based approaches to preventing zoonotic and emerging diseases that integrate veterinary and human medicine (the One Health paradigm) are emphasized.
1101,"Since its discovery and characterization in the early 1980s as a virus that attacks the immune system, there has been some success for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection."
1102,"However, due to the overwhelming public health impact of this virus, a vaccine is needed urgently."
1103,"Despite the tireless efforts of scientist and clinicians, there is still no safe and effective vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity."
1104,"A vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity against HIV infection remains elusive in part due to the following reasons: 1) degree of diversity of the virus, 2) ability of the virus to evade the hosts’ immunity, and 3) lack of appropriate animal models in which to test vaccine candidates."
1105,There have been several attempts to stimulate the immune system to provide protection against HIV-infection.
1106,"Here, we will discuss attempts that have been made to induce sterilizing immunity, including traditional vaccination attempts, induction of broadly neutralizing antibody production, DNA vaccines, and use of viral vectors."
1107,Some of these attempts show promise pending continued research efforts.
1108,"New and emerging infectious diseases continue to plague the world, and there is significant concern that recombinant infectious agents can be used as bioterrorism threats."
1109,Microbiologists are increasingly being asked to apply their scientific knowledge to respond to these threats.
1110,The recent pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus illustrated not only how a newly evolved pathogen can rapidly spread throughout the world but also how the global community can unite to identify the causative agent and control its spread.
1111,"Rapid response research mechanisms, such as those used by the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative (SAVI), have shown that the application of emergency management techniques, together with rapid response research, can be highly effective when applied appropriately to new infectious diseases."
1112, We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine; a combination of the DNA vaccines expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope and –liposome (HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ).
1113,An IL-12 expression vector (IL-12DNA) encoding single-chain IL-12 proteins comprised of p40 and p35 subunits were constructed.
1114,"This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse and guinea pig models compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions."
1115,This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB in the lung) in murine models.
1116,"Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis."
1117,"This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses."
1118,"All monkeys in the control group (saline) died within 8 months, while 50% of monkeys in the HSP65+hIL-12/HVJ group survived more than 14 months post-infection (the termination period of the experiment)."
1119,"Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100% survival)."
1120,"In contrast, 33% of monkeys from BCG Tokyo alone group were alive (33% survival)."
1121,"Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys."
1122,These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.
1123,"In this review, the current state of vaccine development against human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, focusing on recently published data is assessed."
1124,We discuss which strategies have been assessed immunologically and which have been evaluated in SARS coronavirus challenge models.
1125,"We discuss inactivated vaccines, virally and bacterially vectored vaccines, recombinant protein and DNA vaccines, as well as the use of attenuated vaccines."
1126,"Data regarding the correlates of protection, animal models and the available evidence regarding potential vaccine enhancement of SARS disease are discussed."
1127,"While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge."
1128,Current data suggest that intranasal vaccination may be crucial and that new or combination strategies may be required for good protective efficacy against SARS in humans.
1129,Background.
1130,Development of vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is limited by the lack of well-characterized animal models.
1131,"Previous vaccine reports have noted robust neutralizing antibody and inflammatory responses in ferrets, resulting in enhanced hepatitis."
1132,Methods.
1133,We evaluated the humoral immune response and pathological end points in ferrets challenged with the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) after having received formalin-inactivated whole-virus vaccine or mock vaccine.
1134,Results.
1135,Humoral responses were observed in ferrets that received an inactivated virus vaccine.
1136,Histopathological findings in lungs showed that infection of ferrets produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and vaccinated ferrets.
1137,"SARS-CoV infection demonstrated bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing in ferret lung tissue, as seen previously in infected mice."
1138,No evidence of enhanced disease was observed in any of the ferrets.
1139,"All of the ferrets cleared the virus by day 14, 1 week earlier if vaccinated."
1140,Conclusions.
1141,"The vaccine provided mild immune protection to the ferrets after challenge; however, there was no evidence of enhanced liver or lung disease induced by the inactivated whole-virus vaccine."
1142,The ferret may provide another useful model for evaluating SARS vaccine safety and efficacy.
1143,Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a deadly viral respiratory disease caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
1144,"To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease."
1145,"In addition, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent MERS-CoV infection thus far."
1146,"Therefore, our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective MERS vaccine."
1147,"Overall, vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV are mainly based upon the viral spike (S) protein, due to its vital role in the viral infectivity, although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, and non-structural protein 16 (NSP16) have also been reported."
1148,"In general, the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types: viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, nanoparticle-based vaccine, inactivated-whole virus vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine, which are discussed in detail."
1149,"Besides, the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of MERS-CoV infection are extensively reviewed."
1150,"In addition, animal models used to study MERS-CoV and evaluate the vaccine candidates are discussed intensively."
1151,SARS Vaccine Protective in Mice
1152, An inactivated vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was evaluated in rhesus monkeys.
1153,The monkeys were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.)
1154,"with 0.5, 5, 50, or 5000μg of vaccine, or PBS as control, and boosted on day 7."
1155,"After 3 weeks, they were challenged with the NS-1 strain of SARS-CoV."
1156,"The humoral and mucosal immune responses, clinical signs, chemical indices and viremia were monitored following the immunization and challenge."
1157,"The control animals who received PBS developed atypical SAR-CoV infection after viral challenge, according to clinical, virological and pathological findings."
1158,"No systematic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization, even in at the high dose of 5000μg."
1159,The 50μg dosage of vaccine elicited SARS-CoV specific immune responses against viral infection as compared to the partial immunity elicited by 0.5 and 5μg doses.
1160,"The results show that this inactivated vaccine can induce effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV infection, is safe in monkeys, and the vaccine maybe a good candidate for clinical trials."
1161, PRRSV live vaccines are widely used in pig farming practice and are usually not adjuvanted.
1162,"For safety issues, it would be useful to reduce the antigenic load of such vaccines while preserving their efficacy."
1163,In this study we show that the addition of polymer or oil adjuvants in a PRRS live vaccine enhanced the protection to challenge of vaccinated animals compared to a non-adjuvanted commercial reference.
1164,"Moreover, for both types of adjuvants, despite lower antibody titers, the protection to challenge given by the adjuvanted vaccine containing only 50% of the antigen load was equivalent to the protection given by the non-adjuvanted vaccine."
1165,These results demonstrate that the addition of relevant adjuvants can enhance the efficacy of the protection conferred to animals by live vaccines.
1166, Infectious Bovine Rhinothracheitis (IBR) caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) infection is distributed worldwide.
1167,BoHV-1 either alone or in association with other respiratory cattle pathogens causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry.
1168,The aim of this work was to validate a guinea pig model as an alternative method to the current BoHV-1 vaccine potency testing in calves.
1169,"Guinea pigs were immunized with two doses of vaccine, 21 days apart and sampled at 30 days post vaccination (dpv)."
1170,"BoHV-1 antibody (Ab) response to vaccination in guinea pigs, measured by ELISA and virus neutralization (VN), was statistically compared to the Ab response in cattle."
1171,The guinea pig model showed a dose–response relationship to the BoVH-1 antigen concentration in the vaccine and it was able to discriminate among vaccines containing 1log10 difference in its BoHV-1 concentration with very good repeatability and reproducibility (CV≤20%).
1172,"A regression analysis of the Ab titers obtained in guinea pigs and bovines at 30 and 60dpv, respectively, allowed us to classify vaccines in three potency categories: “very satisfactory”, “satisfactory” and “unsatisfactory”."
1173,"Bovines immunized with vaccines corresponding to each of these three categories were experimentally challenged with BoVH-1 virus, the level of protection, as measured by reduction of virus shedding and disease severity, correlated well with the vaccine category used."
1174,"Data generated by 85 experiments, which included vaccination of calves and guinea pigs with 18 reference vaccines of known potency, 8 placebos and 18 commercial vaccines, was subjected to statistical analysis."
1175,Concordance analysis indicated almost perfect agreement between the model and the target species for Ab titers measured by ELISA and almost perfect to substantial agreement when Ab titers were measured by VN.
1176,Taken together these results indicate that the developed guinea pig model represents a novel and reliable tool to estimate batch-to-batch vaccine potency and to predict efficacy of killed BoHV-1 veterinary vaccines.
1177,Marburg and Ebola viruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates.
1178,"Currently, there are no effective treatments and no licensed vaccines; although a number of vaccine platforms have proven successful in animal models."
1179,"The ideal filovirus vaccine candidate should be able to provide rapid protection following a single immunization, have the potential to work postexposure and be cross-reactive or multivalent against all Marburg virus strains and all relevant Ebola virus species and strains."
1180,"Currently, there are multiple platforms that have provided prophylactic protection in nonhuman primates, including DNA, recombinant adenovirus serotype 5, recombinant human parainfluenza virus 3 and virus-like particles."
1181,"In addition, a single platform, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, has demonstrated both prophylactic and postexposure protection in nonhuman primates."
1182,These results demonstrate that achieving a vaccine that is protective against filoviruses is possible; the challenge now is to prove its safety and efficacy in order to obtain a vaccine that is ready for human use.
1183,Improved use of highly pure antigens to improve vaccine safety has led to reduced vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy.
1184,This has led to the need to use adjuvants to improve vaccine immunogenicity.
1185,The ideal adjuvant should maximize vaccine immunogenicity without compromising tolerability or safety or posing undue risk.
1186,"Unfortunately, adjuvant research has lagged behind other vaccine areas such as antigen discovery, with the consequence that only a very limited number of adjuvants based on aluminum salts, monophosphoryl lipid A and oil emulsions are currently approved for human use."
1187,Recent strategic initiatives to support adjuvant development by the National Institutes of Health should translate into greater adjuvant choices in the future.
1188,Mechanistic studies have been valuable in better understanding adjuvant action but mechanisms of adjuvant toxicity are less well understood.
1189,The inflammatory or danger-signal model of adjuvant action implies that increased vaccine reactogenicity is the inevitable price for improved immunogenicity.
1190,"Hence, adjuvant reactogenicity may be avoidable only if it is possible to separate inflammation from adjuvant action."
1191,"The biggest remaining challenge in the adjuvant field is to decipher the potential relationship between adjuvants and rare vaccine adverse reactions such as narcolepsy, macrophagic myofasciitis or Alzheimer’s disease."
1192,"While existing adjuvants based on aluminum salts have a strong safety record, there is an ongoing need for new adjuvants and for more intensive research into adjuvants and their effects."
1193,"ASCARIS LUMBRICOIDES: The Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership is developing a Pan-anthelmintic vaccine that simultaneously targets the major soil-transmitted nematode infections, in other words, ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infection."
1194,The approach builds off the current bivalent Human Hookworm Vaccine now in clinical development and would ultimately add both a larval Ascaris lumbricoides antigen and an adult-stage Trichuris trichiura antigen from the parasite stichosome.
1195,"Each selected antigen would partially reproduce the protective immunity afforded by UV-attenuated Ascaris eggs and Trichuris stichosome extracts, respectively."
1196,"Final antigen selection will apply a ranking system that includes the evaluation of expression yields and solubility, feasibility of process development and the absence of circulating antigen-specific IgE among populations living in helminth-endemic regions."
1197,"Here we describe a five year roadmap for the antigen discovery, feasibility and antigen selection, which will ultimately lead to the scale-up expression, process development, manufacture, good laboratory practices toxicology and preclinical evaluation, ultimately leading to Phase 1 clinical testing."
1198,A major challenge for research on influenza vaccines is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans.
1199,"Vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans, with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines."
1200,Many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza have been conducted in human subjects.
1201,Studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past.
1202,"Therefore, as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues, it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, and a major challenge is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans."
1203,The emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (AI) viruses and the threat of a pandemic caused by AI viruses of this or another subtype has resulted in a resurgence of interest in influenza vaccine research.
1204,"The development of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents a unique set of obstacles, not the least of which is that the demonstration of efficacy in humans is not possible."
1205,"As the correlates of protection from pandemic influenza are not known, we rely on extrapolation of the lessons from seasonal influenza vaccines and on data from the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in animal models to guide our decisions on vaccines for use in humans."
1206,The features and contributions of commonly used animal models for influenza vaccine research are discussed.
1207,The recent emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus underscores the unpredictable nature of influenza viruses and the importance of pandemic preparedness.
1208,Efficient translation of basic vaccine research into clinical therapies greatly depends upon the availability of appropriate animal models.
1209,Testing novel vaccine candidates in animal models is a critical step in the development of modern vaccines.
1210,"Animal models are being used to assess the quality and quantity of the immune response, to identify the optimal route of delivery and formulation, to determine protection from infection and disease transmission, and to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the vaccine formulation."
1211,"Animal models help to make the translation from basic research to clinical application, and they often allow prediction of the vaccine potential, which helps in predicting the financial risks for vaccine manufacturers."
1212,"Choosing an appropriate animal model has become increasingly important for the field, as each model has its own advantages and disadvantages."
1213,"In this review, the criteria for selecting the right animal model, the advantages and disadvantages of various animal models, as well as the future needs for animal models are being discussed."
1214,"Since the discovery, over a decade and a half ago, that genetically engineered DNA can be delivered in vaccine form and elicit an immune response, there has been much progress in understanding the basic biology of this platform."
1215,"A large amount of data has been generated in preclinical model systems, and more sustained cellular responses and more consistent antibody responses are being observed in the clinic."
1216,"Four DNA vaccine products have recently been approved, all in the area of veterinary medicine."
1217,"These results suggest a productive future for this technology as more optimized constructs, better trial designs and improved platforms are being brought into the clinic."
1218,"Immunity to targeted infectious diseases may be conferred or enhanced by vaccines, which are manufactured from recombinant forms as well as inactivated or attenuated organisms."
1219,"These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality and efficacy."
1220,"In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response."
1221,"To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies."
1222,"There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology."
1223,"If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly."
1224,"Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including: using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response."
1225,"Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety."
1226," A workshop on viral vectors for malaria vaccine development, organized by the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, was held in Bethesda, MD on October 20, 2005."
1227,Recent advancements in viral-vectored malaria vaccine development and emerging vector technologies were presented and discussed.
1228,"Classic viral vectors such as poxvirus, adenovirus and alphavirus vectors have been successfully used to deliver malaria antigens."
1229,Some of the vaccine candidates have demonstrated their potential in inducing malaria-specific immunity in animal models and human trials.
1230,"In addition, emerging viral-vector technologies, such as measles virus (MV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and yellow fever (YF) virus, may also be useful for malaria vaccine development."
1231,Studies in animal models suggest that each viral vector is unique in its ability to induce humoral and/or cellular immune responses.
1232,Those studies have also revealed that optimization of Plasmodium genes for mammalian expression is an important aspect of vaccine design.
1233,"Codon-optimization, surface-trafficking, de-glycosylation and removal of toxic domains can lead to improved immunogenicity."
1234,Understanding the vector's ability to induce an immune response and the expression of malaria antigens in mammalian cells will be critical in designing the next generation of viral-vectored malaria vaccines.
1235, Vaccine development has had a huge impact on human health.
1236,"However, there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases."
1237,Several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential.
1238,"This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers — 1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation."
1239,"Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development."
1240,"These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain."
1241,"While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic."
1242,"An overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections, with advantages and disadvantages of each model, is discussed."
1243,"Taken together, advances in nanotechnology, combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy, has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections."
1244,Rhinoviruses (RV’s) are common human pathogens of the respiratory tract being the most frequent cause of mild diseases of the upper respiratory tract (common cold) but more importantly they are a major initiator of acute exacerbations of chronic airway diseases.
1245,Infections can be life threatening in the latter context however RV -induced common colds have an associated economic cost from loss of productivity due to absence from work or school.
1246,There are no appropriate antiviral therapies available and vaccine strategies have failed because of the large number of viral serotypes and the lack of cross-serotype protection generated.
1247,"Here, approaches past and present for development of a vaccine to these widespread human pathogens are highlighted."
1248,"During the past decade several notable viruses have suddenly emerged from obscurity or anonymity to become serious global health threats, provoking concern regarding their sustained epidemic transmission in immunologically naive human populations."
1249,With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development.
1250,"Indeed, vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or non‐existent, or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited."
1251,"While classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non‐replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms."
1252,"Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility."
1253,Several Ebola vaccines and therapeutics are under clinical development.
1254,"However, limited knowledge exists on the quality of antibody response generated by different Ebola vaccines."
1255,"In this study, antibody repertoire induced by vaccination of transchromosomal bovine (TcB) with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein ([GP]; recombinant GP [rGP]) encoded by either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or nanoparticle-based vaccine platform was analyzed using EBOV genome fragment phage display library and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based real-time kinetics assay to measure antibody affinity maturation to both native and partially denatured Ebola GP as well as GP containing the receptor binding domain but lacking the mucin-like domain."
1256,Immunoglobulin (IgG) obtained from rGP nanoparticle-vaccinated TcB demonstrated ~4-fold higher binding affinity compared with DNA-vaccinated TcB-induced IgG against the native rGP’s.
1257,"The rGP nanoparticle vaccine generated a more robust and diverse antibody immune response to the native EBOV-GP compared with the DNA vaccine, which may explain the protective efficacy observed for these antibody preparations."
1258,Andes virus (ANDV) is highly pathogenic in humans and is the primary etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in South America.
1259,Case-fatality rates are as high as 50% and there are no approved vaccines or specific therapies for infection.
1260,Our laboratory has recently developed a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine that expressed the glycoproteins of Andes virus in place of the native VSV glycoprotein (G).
1261,"This vaccine is highly efficacious in the Syrian hamster model of HCPS when given 28 days before challenge with ANDV, or when given around the time of challenge (peri-exposure), and even protects when administered post-exposure."
1262,"Herein, we sought to test the durability of the immune response to a single dose of this vaccine in Syrian hamsters."
1263,"This vaccine was efficacious in hamsters challenged intranasally with ANDV 6 months after vaccination (p = 0.025), but animals were not significantly protected following 1 year of vaccination (p = 0.090)."
1264,"The decrease in protection correlated with a reduction of measurable neutralizing antibody responses, and suggests that a more robust vaccination schedule might be required to provide long-term immunity."
1265,Modern human activity fueled by economic development is profoundly altering our relationship with microorganisms.
1266,This altered interaction with microbes is believed to be the major driving force behind the increased rate of emerging infectious diseases from animals.
1267,"The spate of recent infectious disease outbreaks, including Ebola virus disease and Middle East respiratory syndrome, emphasize the need for development of new innovative tools to manage these emerging diseases."
1268,Disseminating vaccines are one such novel approach to potentially interrupt animal to human (zoonotic) transmission of these pathogens.
1269," There is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines against pneumonic plague, a highly lethal and contagious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis."
1270,"Here we demonstrate that a novel DNA vaccine expressing a modified V antigen (LcrV) of Y. pestis, with a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence, elicited strong V-specific antibody responses in BALB/c mice."
1271,This tPA-V DNA vaccine protected mice from intranasal challenge with lethal doses of Y. pestis.
1272,"In comparison, a DNA vaccine expressing the wild type V antigen was much less effective."
1273,"Only tPA-V formed oligomers spontaneously, and elicited a higher IgG2a anti-V antibody response in immunized mice, suggesting increased TH1 type cellular immune response."
1274,Our data indicate that antigen engineering is effective in inducing high quality protective immune responses against conformationally sensitive antigens.
1275,These results support that optimized DNA vaccines have the potential to protect against bacterial pathogens than is generally recognized.
1276,"Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a severe tick-borne disease, endemic in many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia."
1277,Between 15–70% of reported cases are fatal with no approved vaccine available.
1278,"In the present study, the attenuated poxvirus vector, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus nucleoprotein."
1279,"Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in 2 mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease."
1280,"Despite the immune responses generated post-immunisation, the vaccine failed to protect animals from lethal disease in a challenge model."
1281," A case control study on farm level was conducted at the Clinic for Ruminants, LMU Munich, to identify possible risk factors associated with the observed increase in numbers of calves showing clinical signs of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia (BNP) since 2006 in southern Germany."
1282,Interviews were conducted between August 2008 and June 2010.
1283,"The characteristics of 56 dairy farms with at least one confirmed case of BNP (thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia and/or typical findings in post-mortem examination and bone marrow histology) were compared with those of two sets of 50 control dairy farms each, with no history of BNP."
1284,The first set of 50 control farms was selected randomly from veterinary practices which had never observed a BNP case on the farms they serviced.
1285,The second set of 50 control farms was matched by the veterinary practices which had provided case farms.
1286,Two separate analyses were conducted: (1) case farms (n =56) vs. randomly selected control farms (n =50) and (2) case farms (n =56) vs. a matched set of control farms (n =50).
1287,All variables with p <0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in stepwise logistic regression models.
1288,"In the first analysis, only the use of PregSure® BVD vaccine was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 1292 (95% CI: 114–14707)."
1289,"In the second analysis, conditional logistic regression models did not converge, therefore non-conditional logistic regression models were conducted."
1290,"In the non-conditional analysis five variables remained in the model, three of which were negatively associated with BNP: the use of vitamin E and selenium, the frequent use of mastitis tubes, and the use of stem growth regulators in grain production."
1291,The use of prophylactic measures (such as control of parasites or vaccination of calves against respiratory disease) was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 14.3 as well as the use of PregSure® BVD vaccine with an odds ratio of 426 (95% CI: 20–9095).
1292," The feasibility of developing a prophylactic vaccine against SARS was assessed by comparing the immune responses elicited by immunizing mice with a recombinant SARS spike glycoprotein (S-protein) formulated with different adjuvants, given by different routes."
1293,"In both young and aged mice, an intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific IgG in serum, comparable to those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine."
1294,Serum antibodies were shown to be virus neutralizing.
1295,Intranasal immunization of young mice with the Protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung IgA in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung IgA was detected.
1296,"Following live virus challenge of aged mice, no virus was detected in the lungs of intranasally immunized mice, in contrast to intramuscularly immunized mice whose lung virus titers were comparable to those observed in control mice."
1297,Highly attenuated rabies virus (RV) vaccine vectors were evaluated for their ability to protect against highly pathogenic SIV(mac251) challenge.
1298,"Mamu-A*01 negative rhesus macaques were immunized in groups of four with either: RV expressing SIV(mac239)-GagPol, a combination of RV expressing SIV(mac239)-Env and RV expressing SIV(mac239)-GagPol, or with empty RV vectors."
1299,Eight weeks later animals received a booster immunization with a heterologous RV expressing the same antigens.
1300,"At twelve weeks post-boost, all animals were challenged intravenously with 100 TCID(50) of pathogenic SIV(mac251-CX)."
1301,Immunized macaques in both vaccine groups had 1.3–1.6-log fold decrease in viral set point compared to control animals.
1302,The GagPol/Env immunized animals also had a significantly lower peak viral load.
1303,"When compared to control animals following challenge, vaccinated macaques had a more rapid induction of SIV(mac251) neutralizing antibodies and of CD8(+) T cell responses to various SIV epitopes."
1304,"Moreover, vaccinated macaques better-maintained peripheral memory CD4(+) T cells and were able to mount a poly-functional CD8(+) T cell response in the mucosa."
1305,These findings indicate promise for RV-based vectors and have important implications for the development of an efficacious HIV vaccine.
1306,Significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV).
1307,"Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus."
1308,"Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre’ syndrome in infected adults."
1309,"Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection."
1310,"In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV."
1311,"Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery."
1312,Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity.
1313,"In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)-α/β (designated IFNAR(−/−)) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue."
1314,"In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR(−/−) mice against subsequent viral challenge."
1315,This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans.
1316,Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) remains a serious international public health threat.
1317,"With the goal of accelerating the development of countermeasures against MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), funding agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and researchers across the world assembled in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on November 14–15, 2015, to discuss vaccine development challenges."
1318,"The meeting was spearheaded by the Saudi Ministry of Health and co-organized by the International Vaccine Institute, South Korea."
1319,"Accelerating the development of a preventive vaccine requires a better understanding of MERS epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis in humans and animals."
1320,A combination of rodent and nonhuman primate models should be considered in evaluating and developing preventive and therapeutic vaccine candidates.
1321,Dromedary camels should be considered for the development of veterinary vaccines.
1322,Several vaccine technology platforms targeting the MERS-CoV spike protein were discussed.
1323,"Mechanisms to maximize investment, provide robust data, and affect public health are urgently needed."
1324,Evaluation of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of SARS-CoV Infection in Rhesus Macaques Immunized with an Inactivated SARS-CoV Vaccine
1325,Infectious diseases are linked to 15%–20% of cancers worldwide.
1326,"Among them, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that chronically infects over 90% of the adult population, with over 200,000 cases of cancer and 150,000 cancer-related deaths attributed to it yearly."
1327,"Acute EBV infection can present as infectious mononucleosis, and lead to the future onset of multiple cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma."
1328,"Many of these cancers express latent viral genes, including Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2)."
1329,Previous attempts to create potent immunogens against EBV have been reported but generated mixed success.
1330,"We designed novel Synthetic Consensus (SynCon) DNA vaccines against EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 to improve on the immune potency targeting important antigens expressed in latently infected cells."
1331,These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.
1332,"We optimized the genetic sequences for these three antigens, studied them for expression, and examined their immune profiles in vivo."
1333,We observed that these immunogens generated unique profiles based on which antigen was delivered as the vaccine target.
1334,EBNA1vax and LMP2Avax generated the most robust T cell immunity.
1335,"Interestingly, LMP1vax was a very weak immunogen, generating very low levels of CD8 T cell immunity both as a standalone vaccine and as part of a trivalent vaccine cocktail."
1336,LMP2Avax was able to drive immunity that impacted EBV-antigen-positive tumor growth.
1337,These studies suggest that engineered EBV latent protein vaccines deserve additional study as potential agents for immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.
1338,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of an acute respiratory disease causing atypical pneumonia and diarrhea with high mortality.
1339,"Different types of SARS-CoV vaccines, including nonreplicative and vectored vaccines, have been developed."
1340,Administration of these vaccines to animal model systems has shown promise for the generation of efficacious and safe vaccines.
1341,"Nevertheless, the identification of side effects, preferentially in the elderly animal models, indicates the need to develop novel vaccines that should be tested in improved animal model systems."
1342,Live attenuated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections.
1343,"A limited number of SARS-CoV attenuating modifications have been described, including mutations, and partial or complete gene deletions affecting the replicase, like the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 or nsp2), or the structural genes, and drastic changes in the sequences that regulate the expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs."
1344,"A promising vaccine candidate developed in our laboratory was based on deletion of the envelope E gene alone, or in combination with the removal of six additional genes nonessential for virus replication."
1345,"Viruses lacking E protein were attenuated, grew in the lung, and provided homologous and heterologous protection."
1346,"Improvements of this vaccine candidate have been directed toward increasing virus titers using the power of viruses with mutator phenotypes, while maintaining the attenuated phenotype."
1347,"The safety of the live SARS-CoV vaccines is being increased by the insertion of complementary modifications in genes nsp1, nsp2, and 3a, by gene scrambling to prevent the rescue of a virulent phenotype by recombination or remodeling of vaccine genomes based on codon deoptimization using synthetic biology."
1348,"The newly generated vaccine candidates are very promising, but need to be evaluated in animal model systems that include young and aged animals."
1349,Human adenovirus 5 (AdHu5) vectors are robust vaccine platforms however the presence of naturally-acquired neutralizing antibodies may reduce vector efficacy and potential for re-administration.
1350,This study evaluates immune responses and protection following vaccination with a replication-incompetent porcine adenovirus 3 (PAV3) vector as an alternative vaccine to AdHu5 using an avian influenza H5N1 disease model.
1351,Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in BALB/c mice following vaccination with different doses of the PAV3 vector expressing an optimized A/Hanoi/30408/2005 H5N1 hemagglutinin antigen (PAV3-HA) and compared with an AdHu5-HA control.
1352,"PAV3-HA rapidly generated antibody responses, with significant neutralizing antibody titers on day 21, and stronger cellular immune responses detected on day 8, compared to AdHu5-HA."
1353,"The PAV3-HA vaccine, administered 8 days before challenge, demonstrated improved survival and lower virus load."
1354,Evaluation of long-term vaccine efficacy at 12 months post-vaccination showed better protection with the PAV3-HA than with the AdHu5-HA vaccine.
1355,"Importantly, as opposed to AdHu5, PAV3 vector was not significantly neutralized by human antibodies pooled from over 10,000 individuals."
1356,"Overall, PAV3-based vector is capable of mediating swift, strong immune responses and offer a promising alternative to AdHu5."
1357," Following the anthrax attacks of 2001 and the recent SARS outbreak, concerns about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have catalyzed a renewed interest in developing new vaccination strategies that provide rapid and flexible response options to future threats."
1358,"Because the probability of encountering one of these exotic agents is unknown, it is essential that new vaccine formulations employ methods that provide effective protection and extremely good safety profiles if they are to be used by either military or civilian populations."
1359,"One approach, which potentially satisfies these criteria, is the use of live recombinant Gram-positive commensal bacteria as expression vectors."
1360,"This review provides an overview of the system, its advantages and limitations, and details an example of how Gram-positive commensal bacteria are being developed as a fifth generation vaccine against a Class A biowarfare pathogen, namely smallpox."
1361,": In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death."
1362,"SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents."
1363,"A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs."
1364,We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.
1365,"METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice."
1366,"To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV."
1367,"icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain."
1368,"Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals."
1369,"VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice."
1370,"VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses."
1371,"CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations."
1372,"The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks."
1373,"Macaques have served as models for more than 70 human infectious diseases of diverse etiologies, including a multitude of agents—bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, prions."
1374,"The remarkable diversity of human infectious diseases that have been modeled in the macaque includes global, childhood, and tropical diseases as well as newly emergent, sexually transmitted, oncogenic, degenerative neurologic, potential bioterrorism, and miscellaneous other diseases."
1375,"Historically, macaques played a major role in establishing the etiology of yellow fever, polio, and prion diseases."
1376,"With rare exceptions (Chagas disease, bartonellosis), all of the infectious diseases in this review are of Old World origin."
1377,"Perhaps most surprising is the large number of tropical (16), newly emergent (7), and bioterrorism diseases (9) that have been modeled in macaques."
1378,"Many of these human diseases (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis E, bartonellosis) are a consequence of zoonotic infection."
1379,"However, infectious agents of certain diseases, including measles and tuberculosis, can sometimes go both ways, and thus several human pathogens are threats to nonhuman primates including macaques."
1380,"Through experimental studies in macaques, researchers have gained insight into pathogenic mechanisms and novel treatment and vaccine approaches for many human infectious diseases, most notably acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
1381,"Other infectious agents for which macaques have been a uniquely valuable resource for biomedical research, and particularly vaccinology, include influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, hepatitis E virus, papillomavirus, smallpox virus, Mycobacteria, Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia pestis, and Plasmodium species."
1382,This review summarizes the extensive past and present research on macaque models of human infectious disease.
1383, Electronic medical records of a large veterinary practice were used for surveillance of potential space–time clustering of adverse events associated with rabies vaccination in dogs.
1384,"The study population was 257,564 dogs vaccinated in 169 hospitals in 13 US metropolitan areas during a 24-month period."
1385,"Using a scan statistic for population rate data, significant space–time clusters were identified involving the Atlanta and Tampa/St."
1386,Petersburg areas during a 4-month period.
1387,"Separate spatial–temporal analyses of these cities using coordinates for individual address coordinates identified one significant patient cluster (P =0.002), associated with a 23.26km-radius area in Atlanta (20 adverse events in 702 dogs; 2.85%) from November 2002 through February 2003."
1388,This percentage of adverse events was significantly increased after adjustment for host-related factors and the number of concurrent vaccinations.
1389," Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance, has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1600 people, resulting in more than 600 deaths."
1390,"The high case fatality rate, growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined epidemiology of MERS-CoV have created an urgent need for effective public health countermeasures, paramount of which is an effective means of prevention through a vaccine or antibody prophylaxis."
1391,"Despite the relatively few number of cases to-date, research and development of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates is advancing quickly."
1392,"This review surveys the landscape of these efforts across multiple groups in academia, government and industry."
1393,"Dengue fever is a tropical endemic disease; however, because of climate change, it may become a problem in South Korea in the near future."
1394,Research on vaccines for dengue fever and outbreak preparedness are currently insufficient.
1395,"In addition, because there are no appropriate animal models, controversial results from vaccine efficacy assessments and clinical trials have been reported."
1396,"Therefore, to study the mechanism of dengue fever and test the immunogenicity of vaccines, an appropriate animal model is urgently needed."
1397,"In addition to mouse models, more suitable models using animals that can be humanized will need to be constructed."
1398,"In this report, we look at the current status of model animal construction and discuss which models require further development."
1399,"First identified in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is listed as a new Category C Priority Pathogen."
1400,"While the high mortality of MERS-CoV infection is further intensified by potential human-to-human transmissibility, no MERS vaccines are available for human use."
1401,"This review explains immune responses resulting from MERS-CoV infection, describes MERS vaccine criteria, and presents available small animal models to evaluate the efficacy of MERS vaccines."
1402,"Current advances in vaccine development are summarized, focusing on specific applications and limitations of each vaccine category."
1403,"Taken together, this review provides valuable guidelines toward the development of an effective and safe MERS vaccine."
1404,This article is written for a Special Focus Issue of Expert Review of Vaccines on “Vaccines for Biodefence”.
1405," Virus vaccines have to be immunogenic, sufficiently stable, safe, and suitable to induce long-lasting immunity."
1406,"To meet these requirements, vaccine studies need to provide a comprehensive understanding of (i) the protective roles of antiviral B and T-cell-mediated immune responses, (ii) the complexity and plasticity of major viral antigens, and (iii) virus molecular biology and pathogenesis."
1407,"There are many types of vaccines including subunit vaccines, whole-inactivated virus, vectored, and live-attenuated virus vaccines, each of which featuring specific advantages and limitations."
1408,"While nonliving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable, they may cause side effects and be less efficacious compared to live-attenuated virus vaccines."
1409,"In most cases, the latter induce long-lasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent reversion to highly virulent viruses following vaccination."
1410,"The chapter summarizes the recent progress in the development of coronavirus (CoV) vaccines, focusing on two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, both of which cause deadly disease and epidemics in humans."
1411,"The development of attenuated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogenic CoVs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral virulence proteins that, for example, interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells, and T lymphocytes, thereby modulating antiviral host responses and viral pathogenesis and potentially resulting in deleterious side effects following vaccination."
1412,: Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic agent in the family Paramyxoviridae that is maintained in nature by bats.
1413,"Outbreaks have occurred in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh and have been associated with 40 to 75% case fatality rates."
1414,There are currently no vaccines or postexposure treatments licensed for combating human NiV infection.
1415,"METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of ferrets received a single vaccination with different recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing: Group 1, control with no glycoprotein; Group 2, the NiV fusion protein (F); Group 3, the NiV attachment protein (G); and Group 4, a combination of the NiV F and G proteins."
1416,Animals were challenged intranasally with NiV 28 days after vaccination.
1417,"Control ferrets in Group 1 showed characteristic clinical signs of NiV disease including respiratory distress, neurological disorders, viral load in blood and tissues, and gross lesions and antigen in target tissues; all animals in this group succumbed to infection by day 8."
1418,"Importantly, all specifically vaccinated ferrets in Groups 2-4 showed no evidence of clinical illness and survived challenged."
1419,All animals in these groups developed anti-NiV F and/or G IgG and neutralizing antibody titers.
1420,"While NiV RNA was detected in blood at day 6 post challenge in animals from Groups 2-4, the levels were orders of magnitude lower than animals from control Group 1."
1421,CONCLUSIONS: These data show protective efficacy against NiV in a relevant model of human infection.
1422,Further development of this technology has the potential to yield effective single injection vaccines for NiV infection.
1423,Biodegradable nanoparticle-based vaccine development research is unexplored in large animals and humans.
1424,"In this study, we illustrated the efficacy of nanoparticle-entrapped UV-killed virus vaccine against an economically important respiratory viral disease of pigs called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)."
1425,We entrapped PLGA [poly (lactide-co-glycolides)] nanoparticles with killed PRRSV antigens (Nano-KAg) and detected its phagocytosis by pig alveolar macrophages.
1426,Single doses of Nano-KAg vaccine administered intranasally to pigs upregulated innate and PRRSV specific adaptive responses.
1427,"In a virulent heterologous PRRSV challenge study, Nano-KAg vaccine significantly reduced the lung pathology and viremia, and the viral load in the lungs."
1428,"Immunologically, enhanced innate and adaptive immune cell population and associated cytokines with decreased secretion of immunosuppressive mediators were observed at both mucosal sites and blood."
1429,"In summary, we demonstrated the benefits of intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-based viral vaccine in eliciting cross-protective immune response in pigs, a potential large animal model."
1430, An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading.
1431,"Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics."
1432,"This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome."
1433,"The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful."
1434,"After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans."
1435, Vaccination is considered one of the most effective ways to control pathogens and prevent diseases in humans as well as in the veterinary field.
1436,"Traditional vaccines against animal viral diseases are based on inactivated or attenuated viruses, but new subunit vaccines are gaining attention from researchers in animal vaccinology."
1437,"Among these, virus-like particles (VLPs) represent one of the most appealing approaches opening up interesting frontiers in animal vaccines."
1438,VLPs are robust protein scaffolds exhibiting well-defined geometry and uniformity that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome.
1439,They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety.
1440,VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities.
1441,"In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens."
1442,"VLPs have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines; nevertheless, only one veterinary VLP-base vaccine is licensed."
1443,"Here, we review and examine in detail the current status of VLPs as a vaccine strategy in the veterinary field, and discuss the potential advantages and challenges of this technology."
1444," The frequency of moderate to severe adverse reactions associated with smallpox vaccines currently stockpiled in the US, and the continued threat of bioterrorism have prompted the development of effective vaccines with improved safety profiles."
1445,"LC16m8, an attenuated, replicating smallpox vaccine derived from the Lister strain of vaccinia, is currently licensed in Japan where it was safely used in over 50,000 children in the 1970s."
1446,It has been shown to have markedly less neurotoxicity than unattenuated vaccines in nonclinical studies.
1447,"LC16m8 is immunogenic after a single dose, and recent studies in two different animal models have demonstrated protective efficacy equivalent to that of the only FDA-licensed smallpox vaccine."
1448,This article reviews the history and available scientific literature regarding LC16m8 and provides comparisons to other smallpox vaccines.
1449," Rinderpest is an acute, highly contagious often fatal disease of large and small ruminants, both domestic and wild."
1450,"Global eradication of rinderpest needs a robust, safe and cost-effective vaccine."
1451,"The causative agent, rinderpest virus (RPV) is an important member of the genus Morbillivirus in the Paramyxoviridae family."
1452,"We have generated transgenic peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) plants expressing hemagglutinin protein of RPV and report here, the induction of immune responses in cattle following oral feeding with transgenic leaves expressing hemagglutinin protein without oral adjuvant."
1453,"Hemagglutinin-specific antibody was detected in the serum as confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of virus-infected cells, and in vitro neutralization of virus infectivity."
1454,Oral delivery also resulted in cell-mediated immune responses.
1455,Distinct roadblocks prevent translating basic findings in viral pathogenesis into therapies and implementing potential solutions in the clinic.
1456,"An ongoing partnership between the Volkswagen Foundation and Nature Medicine resulted in an interactive meeting in 2012, as part of the “Herrenhausen Symposia” series."
1457,Current challenges for various fields of viral research were recognized and discussed with a goal in mind—to identify solutions and propose an agenda to address the translational barriers.
1458,"Here, some of the researchers who participated at the meeting provide a concise outlook at the most pressing unmet research and clinical needs, identifying these key obstacles is a necessary step towards the prevention and cure of human viral diseases."
1459,Live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine virus (MV) Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) strain was evaluated as a viral vector to express the ectodomains of fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV F) or glycoprotein 350 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV gp350) as candidate vaccines for prophylaxis of RSV and EBV.
1460,The glycoprotein gene was inserted at the 1(st) or the 3(rd) position of the measles virus genome and the recombinant viruses were generated.
1461,Insertion of the foreign gene at the 3(rd) position had a minimal impact on viral replication in vitro.
1462,RSV F or EBV gp350 protein was secreted from infected cells.
1463,"In cotton rats, EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV- and insert-specific antibody responses."
1464,"In addition, both vaccines also induced insert specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ) secreting T cell response."
1465,EZ-RSV F protected cotton rats from pulmonary replication of RSV A2 challenge infection.
1466,"In rhesus macaques, although both EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV specific neutralizing antibody responses, only RSV F specific antibody response was detected."
1467,"Thus, the immunogenicity of the foreign antigens delivered by measles vaccine virus is dependent on the nature of the insert and the animal models used for vaccine evaluation."
1468,The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic.
1469,"The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae."
1470,"Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2."
1471,"In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date."
1472,"While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance."
1473,This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.
1474,COVID-19: a novel zoonotic disease caused by a coronavirus from China: what we know and what we don’t
1475,"In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host."
1476,Chest radiograph score data are used to estimate the parameters of that model.
1477,Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is around 3.79.
1478,Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of MERS virus is 8.16 which is higher than SARS-CoV-2.
1479,The PRCC method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters and the drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model.
1480,Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro
1481,"The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions."
1482,The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another.
1483,The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system.
1484,"The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated."
1485,"The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature."
1486,"The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0."
1487,Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.
1488,"The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least six lives as of January 22 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals."
1489,"The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community."
1490,"We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world."
1491,The virus receptor is key for viral infection of host cells.
1492,Identification of the virus receptor is still challenging at present.
1493,"Our previous study has shown that human virus receptor proteins have some unique features including high level of N-glycosylation, high number of interaction partners and high expressions."
1494,"Here, we built a random-forest model to identify human virus receptorome from human cell membrane proteins with accepted accuracy based on combination of unique features of human virus receptors and protein sequences."
1495,A total of 729 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome for the human-infecting virome.
1496,"Combination of the random-forest model with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies further predicted receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses, such as the Enterovirus, Norovirus and West Nile virus."
1497,"Finally, we predicted the candidate alternative receptors for the 2019-nCoV."
1498,The study would greatly facilitate identification of receptors for human-infecting virome.
1499,"Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2."
1500,"Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable."
1501,Both viruses utilize the same receptor&mdash;angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&mdash;for invading human bodies.
1502,"Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion."
1503,"Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats."
1504,The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable.
1505,"Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel."
1506,These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology.
1507,"However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan."
1508,These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.
1509," To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed."
1510,"To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene."
1511,"We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes."
1512,"Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22?24 November 2019 and 1.19?1.31 ?"
1513,"10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively."
1514,Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378).
1515,"We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility."
1516,"Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif."
1517,"Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins."

1520,Arguments in favour of remdesivir for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections
1521, The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness.
1522,A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins.
1523,"Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID=8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials."
1524,"Later, MERS-CoV (M PID=9%, N PID =44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities."
1525,"Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID=48%) has to be placed in Category B."
1526,"Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID=6%) among coronaviruses."
1527,This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body.
1528,An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids.
1529,These particles are also likelier to remain active longer.
1530,These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.
1531,C3A is a sub-clone of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with the strong contact inhibition of growth.
1532,"We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells."
1533,"In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells."
1534,"Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43."
1535,"While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection."
1536,"Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2."
1537,"Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses."
1538,The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.
1539, The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide.
1540,"To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority."
1541,We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease.
1542,SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication.
1543,"Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection."
1544,"At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets."
1545,"Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission."
1546,"Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs."
1547,"Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines."
1548, The novel coronavirus infection that initially found at the end of 2019 has attracted great attention.
1549,"So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no “specific drug” available."
1550,Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS.
1551,"In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” has become a feasible solution."
1552,The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”.
1553,China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
1554,"We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus."
1555,"Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19."
1556,"The current corona virus disease 2019 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has put the world on alert."
1557,"To safeguard Chinese citizens and to strengthen global health security, China has made great efforts to control the epidemic."
1558,Many in the global community have joined China to limit the epidemic.
1559,"However, discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing globally, superseding evidence and jeopardizing the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 efforts."
1560,We analyze this phenomenon and its underlying causes and suggest practical solutions.
1561,The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.
1562,This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts.
1563,"Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections."
1564,"Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case."
1565,"Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV."
1566,"Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action."
1567,The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load.
1568,"Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects."
1569,"Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies."
1570," Background and aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation."
1571,Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature.
1572,Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020.
1573,"Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease."
1574,"Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers."
1575,"Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, however, data is limited and there is immediate need for fast track research."
1576, SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the stool of patients in the recovery phase.
1577,Children show a longer shedding time than adults.
1578,We analyzed the possible causes of this finding and recommend that a negative stool sample be included in a patient's discharge criteria.
1579, The present paper describes the mathematical modeling and dynamics of a novel corona virus (2019-nCoV).
1580,"We describe the brief details of interaction among the bats and unknown hosts, then among the peoples and the infections reservoir (seafood market)."
1581,The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there.
1582,The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically.
1583,We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people.
1584,We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model.
1585,"We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model."
1586,We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R 0 ≈ 2.4829 .
1587,"The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization."
1588,"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was recently identified in patients with an acute respiratory syndrome, COVID-19."
1589,"To compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging coronaviruses, we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV and compared with historical SARS-CoV infections."
1590,"In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity."
1591,"In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes."
1592,"These data show that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a COVID-19-like disease, and suggest that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is intermediate between that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.One Sentence SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques results in COVID-19-like disease with prolonged virus excretion from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs."
1593, The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
1594,"However, so far, there are still controversies about the source of the virus and its intermediate host."
1595,"Here, we found the novel coronavirus was closely related to coronaviruses derived from five wild animals, including Paguma larvata, Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, Civet, Aselliscus stoliczkanus and Rhinolophus sinicus, and was in the same branch of the phylogenetic tree."
1596,"However, genome and ORF1a homology show that the virus is not the same coronavirus as the coronavirus derived from these five animals, whereas the virus has the highest homology with Bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13."
1597,"A novel coronavirus has caused thousands of human infections in China since December 2019, raising a global public health concern."
1598,"Recent studies (Huang et al ., Chan et al ., and Zhou et al .)"
1599,"have provided timely insights into its origin and ability to spread among humans, informing infection prevention and control practices."
1600,• Integrin may act as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and could be implicated in its transmission and pathology.
1601,• The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 acquired a RGD motif known to bind integrins.
1602,This motif is absent from other coronaviruses.
1603,"• The integrin-binding motif is present at the surface of the spike protein, close to the ACE2 receptor-binding region."
1604,"• Integrin binding may be a promising therapeutics target, and should be tested experimentally."
1605,"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans."
1606,"Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism."
1607,"However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women."
1608,"In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject."
1609,"We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease."
1610,"Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease."
1611," In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China."
1612,"On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern."
1613,"As of February 14, 2020, 49,053 laboratory-confirmed and 1,381 deaths have been reported globally."
1614,Perceived risk of acquiring disease has led many governments to institute a variety of control measures.
1615,We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic.
1616,"In this literature review, the causative agent, pathogenesis and immune responses, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and management of the disease, control and preventions strategies are all reviewed."
1617,Strategies to trace back the origin of COVID-19
1618,"Background As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020."
1619,"The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020."
1620,This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus.
1621,"Methods In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection."
1622,"Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model."
1623,The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.
1624,Results The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.
1625,"Conclusions Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea."
1626,": The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur."
1627,AIM: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.
1628,"METHODS: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology."
1629,"RESULTS: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV."
1630,"Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses."
1631,"Control material is made available through European Virus Archive – Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project."
1632,CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in national and European research networks.
1633,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency of international concern.
1634,"With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective."
1635,"Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak."
1636,"Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission."
1637,Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals.
1638,"We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic."
1639,: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease.
1640,This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses.
1641,"The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China."
1642,Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries.
1643,Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission.
1644,Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients.
1645,METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome.
1646,"The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus."
1647,These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls.
1648,"In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested."
1649,"RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction)."
1650,"Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction."
1651,All negative control samples were negative in the assays.
1652,Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests.
1653,"CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients."
1654,"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population."
1655,Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals.
1656,"Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection."
1657,"While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death."
1658,"Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak."
1659,"I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches."
1660,"Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future."
1661,"The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity."
1662,"The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action."
1663,"The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken."
1664,Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).
1665,There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
1666,"The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019."
1667,"There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020)."
1668,"The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others."
1669,"The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction."
1670,Many people are asymptomatic.
1671,The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%.
1672,Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests.
1673,Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).
1674,The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease.
1675,Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established.
1676,Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions.
1677,"The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality."
1678,The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.
1679,"As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020."
1680,"In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection."
1681,"Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model."
1682,The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.
1683,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the ongoing pandemic of 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19), which is already responsible for far more deaths than were reported during the previous public health emergencies of international concern provoked by two related pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) from 2002 and 2012."
1684,The identification of any clinically approved drug that could be repurposed to combat COVID-19 would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures to complement social distancing and isolation protocols.
1685,"The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target for drug interventions, based on results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV) an HIV protease inhibitor, that that can inhibit the Mpro of 2002 SARS-CoV."
1686,"However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved anti-retroviral protease inhibitors that may bind more efficiently to Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and block its replication."
1687,"Of high interest is atazanavir (ATV) due to its documented bioavailability within the respiratory tract, which motivated our evaluation on its ability to impair SARS-CoV-2 replication through a series of in vitro experiments."
1688,A molecular dynamic analysis showed that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with greater strength than LPV and occupied the substrate cleft on the active side of the protease throughout the entire molecular dynamic analysis.
1689,"In a cell-free protease assay, ATV was determined to block Mpro activity at a concentration of 10 μM."
1690,"Next, a series of assays with in vitro models of virus infection/replications were performed using three cell types, Vero cells, a human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary human monocytes, which confirmed that ATV could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV)."
1691,"In addition, the virus-induced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were reduced in the presence of these drugs, which performed better than chloroquine, a compound recognized for its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities."
1692,"Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19."
1693,We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread.
1694,We use a compartmental model fit to the existing data.
1695,The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present.
1696,For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet.
1697,Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.
1698,"Cases of 2019-nCoV are now being reported in different regions around the globe, concerning for a possible SARS like epidemic that infected for than 8000 people in 2002-03."
1699,"Though, major health authorities are still working on understanding the virus and its transmission, here we present a brief report regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak and what is known so far."
1700,"In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China."
1701,A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia.
1702,"Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily."
1703,"Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans."
1704,Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing.
1705,(Funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China.)
1706, Aims To analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases.
1707,"Data Synthesis COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage."
1708,"Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients."
1709,"Conclusions In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases."
1710,"Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis."
1711,The pandemic of COVID-19 has been taking lives worldwide.
1712,It caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population.
1713,It targets human’s lung and causes serious damage of lungs.
1714,"Based on early reports, for people with underlying heart issues, the concerns are serious."
1715,It appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms.
1716,"In addition, some of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cardiovascular diseases in China."
1717,"As characteristic analysis of COVID-19 patients, hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity [1] and mortality of COVID-19 patients [2]."
1718,"Therefore, to better understand the development of COVID-19 and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of COVID-19 patients."
1719,From Hendra to Wuhan: what has been learned in responding to emerging zoonotic viruses
1720,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December, 2019."
1721,"Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pandemic."
1722,"SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown."
1723,"Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2."
1724,"We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats."
1725,We found that the virus transmits in cats via respiratory droplets.
1726,Our study provides important insights into the animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.
1727,No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2
1728,I have been researching coronaviruses for more than forty years.
1729,This viewpoint summarizes some of the major findings in coronavirus research made before the SARS epidemic and how they inform current research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.
1730,"Another animal to human transmission of a coronavirus occurred in December 2019 on a live animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan causing an epidemic in China, reaching now different continents."
1731,"This minireview summarizes the research literature on the virological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of this epidemic published until end of February 2020."
1732,"Since the introduction of the novel Corona Virus (The COVID 19) to the Chinese city Wuhan in the Hubei province during the late December 2019, the effectiveness of the deadly disease, its human infection, spreading severity and the mortality rate of the infection has been an issue of debate."
1733,The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic.
1734,"Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID 19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome."
1735,"In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID 19) infections are infectious during the incubation period."
1736,"In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g."
1737,"droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus."
1738,"By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility Exposure Infection Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India."
1739,"Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level."
1740,The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments.
1741,"Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model."
1742,"Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque."
1743,"Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions."
1744,"Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions."
1745,The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial.
1746,"It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV."
1747,The emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has awakened the echoes of SARS-CoV from nearly two decades ago.
1748,"Yet, with technological advances and important lessons gained from previous outbreaks, perhaps the world is better equipped to deal with the most recent emergent group 2B coronavirus."
1749,The novel Coronavirus pathogen Covid-19 is a cause of concern across the world as the human-to-human infection caused by it is spreading at a fast pace.
1750,"The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents."
1751,"The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries."
1752,"Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved."
1753,"India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection."
1754,"Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission."
1755,The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects.
1756,"However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context."
1757,Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread.
1758,"Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease."
1759,"In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the further course this pandemic can take."
1760,"The data can be used by the health care agencies, the Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to fight the pandemic."
1761,"Though the model is preliminary, it can be used at regional level to manage the health care system in the present scenario."
1762,"The recommendations can be made, and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional levels."
1763,"The disease known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), potentially caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has hit the world hard, and has led to an unprecedent health and economic crisis."
1764,"In order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 effects, we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells, but this kind of studies are still scarce."
1765,A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2.
1766,"In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis."
1767,"Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated."
1768,The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.
1769,"Background Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none succeeded in describing the pandemic at the global level."
1770,We propose a set of parameters for the first COVID-19 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM).
1771,"The simulation starting with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 125 days in multiple countries across three continents."
1772,"Methods We have built a modified SIR model and parameterized it analytically, according to the literature and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread."
1773,We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixeight selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions.
1774,The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data.
1775,"Findings The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, ~4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001."
1776,"Also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model."
1777,Interpretation Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated.
1778,This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases.
1779,"Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated."
1780,Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.
1781,"Recently, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirius as a pandemic, and declared it as Public Health Emergency of International Concern."
1782,"More than 6,83,536 positive cases and 32,139 deaths caused by coronavirus 2019 affecting 199 countries and territories."
1783,This pandemic can transform into an extremely destructive form if we still do not take it seriously.
1784,"In this present study, we propose a generalized SEIR model of COVID-2019 to study the behavior of its transmission under different control strategies."
1785,": In the beginning of 2020, an unexpected outbreak due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world."
1786,Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat.
1787,The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
1788,"METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020."
1789,All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis.
1790,RESULTS: The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study.
1791,"According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.43%) and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%-9.28%), respectively."
1792,"CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively."
1793,Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from December 2019 in China.
1794,2019-nCoV which was identified is a kind of beta coronavirus belongs to one of four coronavirus genera.
1795,"Except 2019-nCoV, two other beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are also quite harmful to human beings."
1796,"2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV."
1797,And dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or CD26 is the cell receptor for MERS-CoV.
1798,"The expression of ACE2 was found to have obvious positive expression in human corneal and conjunctival epithelium, and corneal endothelium."
1799,DPP4 activity was presented in normal animal conjunctival epithelium and fibroblasts of the subjacent connective tissue.
1800,It was also presented in the whole corneal epithelium and tear fluid of animal with severe injured corneas.
1801,"The two receptors, ACE2 and DPP4, involve in many cellular&nbsp;signaling&nbsp;pathways and pathophysiological&nbsp;processes."
1802,"Their expression in the cells of ocular surface may be an access route of corona virus in eye, which provides clues to elucidating the pathogenesis of corona virus in the eyeballs."
1803," Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected."
1804,"This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous."
1805,"On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated—Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan."
1806,"Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China."
1807,These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far.
1808,"At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures."
1809,"These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation—public health experts, the government, and the general public."
1810,"It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation."
1811,This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health emergencies.
1812,World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
1813,The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
1814,"Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe."
1815,"The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome."
1816,The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans.
1817,The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction.
1818,"Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense."
1819,"A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made."
1820,"We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes."
1821,"Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed."
1822,The global spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is overwhelming many health-care systems.
1823,"As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic."
1824,We note that the majority of existing models do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals (i.e.
1825,the underlying human interaction network).
1826,Using network science we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies.
1827,"Although applicable to disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models."
1828,We provide commented source code for all our analyses so that they can easily be integrated into current and future epidemiological models.
1829,2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV.
1830,We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells.
1831,"The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures."
1832,"However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV."
1833,Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
1834,A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2.
1835,"ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals."
1836,"Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus."
1837,2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets.
1838,"However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible."
1839,"Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus."
1840,"A novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world."
1841,"At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person."
1842,Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally.
1843,"To prevent the next pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade."
1844,"As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic."
1845, Background and aims The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency.
1846,An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported.
1847,"Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea."
1848,"Methods We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
1849,Results Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.
1850,It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms.
1851,A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%.
1852,SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
1853,"ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia."
1854,"ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon."
1855,SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.
1856,Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs.
1857,"Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation."
1858,Conclusion Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
1859,"Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms."
1860,"The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research."
1861,The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries.
1862,"With almost 65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February 2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population, COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency."
1863,The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
1864,"In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002–2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases."
1865,"Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility."
1866,It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.
1867," Outside the Hubei province, China, the mild form of infection and the progressive recover of the COVID-19 patients suggest the intervention of “unconventional” biological mechanisms worthy of attention."
1868,"Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we hypothesized that past contact with infected dogs shield humans against the circulating SARS-CoV-2."
1869,"Elseways, the recurrent virus exposure over a short time-lapse might result in the Antibody Dependent Enhancement, triggering the violent immune reaction responsible for the severe clinical outcomes observed in the Hubei province."
1870,"Nevertheless, further experimental studies are desired for a confidential evaluation of the postulated hypotheses."
1871," Background In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China."
1872,"A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."
1873,"As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed."
1874,"Methods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan."
1875,Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.
1876,"Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends."
1877,Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.
1878,Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.
1879,"Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity."
1880,"Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%)."
1881,"Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV."
1882,"Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues."
1883,Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.
1884,"Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans."
1885,"Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans."
1886,"The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation."
1887,"Funding National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University."
1888,Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies.
1889,"In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life."
1890,"Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials."
1891,"Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings."
1892,"As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded."
1893,It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation.
1894,"Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community."
1895,Evolutionary perspectives on novel coronaviruses identified in pneumonia cases in China
1896, Background A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China.
1897,Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.
1898,Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.
1899,"Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences."
1900,"Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch."
1901,"Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely."
1902,We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.
1903,These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.
1904,A new pandemic out of China: the Wuhan 2019-nCoV coronavirus syndrome
1905,Background Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease.
1906,"Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection."
1907,"Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness."
1908,"Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020)."
1909,"Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases."
1910,"Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably."
1911,"Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission."
1912,These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.
1913,"Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread."
1914,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2."
1915,"Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor."
1916,"In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss."
1917,"Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis."
1918,"The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability in vivo, all highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses."
1919,"A novel coronavirus, probably of bat origin, has caused an outbreak of severe respiratory infection in humans in Wuhan, China and has been dispersed globally by travelers."
1920,The WHO has declared the spread of the infection a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
1921," Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)."
1922,The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.
1923,COVID-19 from veterinary medicine and one health perspectives: What animal coronaviruses have taught us
1924,"Coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) is threatening global public health, social stability, and economic development."
1925,"To meet this challenge, this article discusses advances in the research and development of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) for the prevention and treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other human CoVs."
1926,Coronavirus COVID-19 spreads through the population mostly based on social contact.
1927,"To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making."
1928,We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made.
1929,We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK.
1930,We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members.
1931,"The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease."
1932,We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK.
1933,Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios.
1934,"This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR)."
1935,"It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution."
1936,Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated.
1937,"Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models."
1938,We use the model to assess parameter sensitivity for a number of key variables that characterise the COVID-19 epidemic.
1939,We also test several control parameters with respect to their influence on the severity of the outbreak.
1940,"Our analysis shows that due to inclusion of spatial heterogeneity in the population and the asynchronous timing of the epidemic across different areas, the severity of the epidemic might be lower than expected from other models."
1941,"We find that one of the most crucial control parameters that may significantly reduce the severity of the epidemic is the degree of separation of vulnerable people and people aged 70 years and over, but note also that isolation of other groups has an effect on the severity of the epidemic."
1942,"It is important to remember that models are there to advise and not to replace reality, and that any action should be coordinated and approved by public health experts with experience in dealing with epidemics."
1943,The computational approach makes it possible for further extensive scenario-based analysis to be undertaken.
1944,This and a comprehensive study of sensitivity of the model to different parameters defining COVID-19 and its development will be the subject of our forthcoming paper.
1945,"In that paper, we shall also extend the model where we will consider different probabilistic scenarios for infected people with mild and severe cases."
1946,The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019.
1947,"The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host."
1948,Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell.
1949,"In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein."
1950,"We used homology-based protein-protein docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction."
1951,"Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation."
1952,We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface.
1953,"Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD."
1954,We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.
1955,A Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak A Call for Action
1956," Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China."
1957,Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.
1958,No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.
1959,"Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan."
1960,Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.
1961,"Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020."
1962,"Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus."
1963,"Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members."
1964,"None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital."
1965,"Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure."
1966,"They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset."
1967,They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.
1968,"Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels."
1969,"The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing."
1970,"Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats."
1971,"Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions."
1972,"Funding The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission)."
1973,The fast and untraceable virus mutations take lives of thousands of people before the immune system can produce the inhibitory antibody.
1974,Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world.
1975,Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands.
1976,"In this paper, we devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus."
1977,We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML model to predict the antibody response.
1978,"Using graph featurization with variety of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19."
1979,"We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the Corona virus."
1980,Background: As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a worldwide pandemic it is rapidly expanding in Iran realtime analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions.
1981,In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces.
1982,we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country.
1983,Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series.
1984,This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight.
1985,"The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season."
1986,Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time.
1987,Results: If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June.
1988,However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days).
1989,"In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June."
1990,The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset.
1991,The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event.
1992,The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000 5000 and 5000 30000 of recovered cases.
1993,Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing.
1994,Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one.
1995,This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person.
1996,Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing.
1997,In addition many factors are effective in stopping the disease.
1998,These include citizens participation in the prevention process health education the effectiveness of instructive traditions environmental conditions and so on.
1999,"The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an emerging pathogen of critical significance to international public health."
2000,"Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited."
2001,"Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes."
2002,A critical question for treatment and protection is why it appears that the severity of infection may correlate with the initial level of virus exposure.
2003,"Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable ""choke points"" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate response dynamics."
2004,"Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung and intestinal tissue that will be iteratively refined."
2005,"The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and interactive, cloud-hosted executables in under 12 hours."
2006,"In a sustained community effort, this model will integrate data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health."
2007,"Novel coronavirus pneumonia broke out from Wuhan, and spreading to the whole nation and world since Dec, 2019."
2008,It is now the critical stage to fight against the virus.
2009,Previous epidemiological investigations and animal experiments suggest aerosol could perform as virus transmitter.
2010,"Based on the clinical observation, the possibility of aerosol transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus has aroused a lot of attention."
2011,"This study focuses on the feature of aerosol transmission, and the pathogens involved in."
2012,We analyzed the possibility of aerosol transmission for the novel coronavirus.
2013,"Relevant strategies to prevent novel coronavirus pneumonia are established, serving as references to the medical personnel and general public during their work or daily life."
2014,"( Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56: )."
2015," Viral respiratory diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), always pose severe threat to people."
2016,"First identified in the late December 2019, in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rampantly spread to lots of provinces in China, and multiple countries are affected."
2017,The viral outbreaks have stirred panic and emergency on public health around the world and the number of infections continues to rise.
2018,But the cause and consequence of the pneumonia still remain unknown.
2019,"In order to effectively implement the epidemic prevention, early identification and diagnosis is critical to disease control."
2020,"Herein we scrutinize a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection."
2021,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus – 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China."
2022,This virus causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
2023,"Since then, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular infection."
2024,The ocular implications of human CoV infections have not been widely studied.
2025,"However, CoVs have been known to cause various ocular infections in animals."
2026,"Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline and murine models."
2027,"In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed."
2028,The review article will also highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections.
2029,We hope that this article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications of human CoV infections.
2030,Occupational risks for COVID-19 infection
2031,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health."
2032,"In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded."
2033,"Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012."
2034,"In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019."
2035,Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019.
2036,"As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology."""
2037,The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program.
2038,"The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19."
2039,"On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a ""COVID-19,"" which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019""."
2040,"In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred."
2041,"SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases."
2042,This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally.
2043,"In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission."
2044,"An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States."
2045,"Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV."
2046,"Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs)."
2047,The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks.
2048,They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species.
2049,"For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS."
2050,"Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans."
2051,"The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin."
2052,The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk.
2053,"Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the ""very high"" level, on February 28, 2020."
2054,"Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving."
2055,World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects.
2056,Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat.
2057,"At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing."
2058,"Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interac ion and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak."
2059,"At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon."
2060,Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days.
2061,"In Italy, in geographic regions of the north of the peninsula, political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that is severely testing the health system."
2062,"In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to use the ""Statpearls"" platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in real-time."
2063,"The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated."
2064,"In two recent articles from Huang C et al and Yang X in The Lancet,2,3 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed lymphopenia."
2065,"The presence of lymphopenia as a signature of severe COVID-19 was confirmed by Wang D et al, who, in their study published in JAMA, reported that ICU patients suffering this infection had a median lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm,3 with non survivors exhibiting persistent lymphopenia.4 ICU patients present also with high levels of plasma cytokines.2 The existence of hyper-cytokinemia in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia could indicate a poor control of the pathogen, as showed in severe patients infected with the 2009 Pandemic Influenza virus."
2066,"Interestingly, hypercytokinemia and lymphopenia were also evident in critical patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to the Coronavirus emerged in 2003 (SARS-CoV).5,6 These features (lymphopenia + hypercytokinemia) fit the characteristics of a particular immunological phenotype of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), lymphopenic CAP (L-CAP), which, as we recently demonstrated in an article published in the Journal of Infection, is associated with increased severity, mortality and a dysregulated immunological response.7 In their works, Yang X et al and Chen N et al propose a direct cytotoxic action of the virus to explain the low lymphocyte counts observed in the severe cases of COVID-19.3,8 But, in our opinion, host factors could also contribute to induce lymphopenia in these cases."
2067,"Compared with those patients not requiring intensive care, COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU are older and are more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.4 Aging and chronic diseases induce chronic endothelial dysfunction."
2068,"As we recently reviewed in J Clin Med, endothelial dysfunction induces disassembly of intercellular junctions, endothelial cell death and blood-tissue barrier disruption, along with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, which could contribute to explain the lymphopenia observed in severe COVID-19 patients.9 Recent findings from our group have evidenced the interconnection between lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAP and organ failure.10 Endothelial dysfunction induces also increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, glycocalyx degradation and shedding along with a pro-coagulant and anti-fibrinolytic state.9 In aged individuals with chronic diseases, these features could represent predisposing factors for presenting a severe respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection."
2069,SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2.
2070,Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2.
2071,In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses’ similar binding affinities to ACE2.
2072,The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
2073,Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2.
2074,"ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism."
2075,"These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants."
2076,Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments.
2077,Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.
2078,"The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths."
2079,"For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g."
2080,mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections.
2081,While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g.
2082,"hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible."
2083,"Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units."
2084,Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.
2085,The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge.
2086,"We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios."
2087,Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation.
2088,"We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing."
2089,"However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection."
2090,"The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs."
2091,We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic.
2092,The website corona-lab.ch provides an interactive simulation tool based on the presented model.
2093,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality ranging from 3% to 6%."
2094,"To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV."
2095,"For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae."
2096,"We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host."
2097,"Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses."
2098,We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents.
2099,"Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes."
2100,"Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones."
2101,"Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV."
2102,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years."
2103,"Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold."
2104,The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
2105,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
2106,HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
2107,Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
2108,The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
2109,Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
2110,Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
2111,"In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission."
2112,"Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination."
2113,The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
2114,"In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted."
2115," As of March 24, 2020, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for 379,661 infection cases with 16,428 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly."
2116,"Herein, we presented four critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received supportive care and convalescent plasma."
2117,"Although all the four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually, randomized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy."
2118,"An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019."
2119,"With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred."
2120,"At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020."
2121,"At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO."
2122,It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought.
2123,"Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control."
2124,"More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina."
2125,"According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV."
2126, Objectives Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.
2127,"However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation."
2128,This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
2129,"Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020."
2130,"Results All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation."
2131,"Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue."
2132,One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 × 109 cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 × 109 cells per L).
2133,All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels.
2134,"Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus."
2135,Conclusions Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them.
2136," Aims A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19."
2137,The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier.
2138,"There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively."
2139,"Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries."
2140,"Main methods In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses."
2141,"Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp."
2142,"In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically."
2143,Significance The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19.
2144,The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease.
2145,No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.
2146,"The outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed that 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts."
2147,"In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins."
2148,The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV.
2149,"Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans."
2150,Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins.
2151,Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.
2152, The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is evolving very quickly and means a special risk for both immunosuppressed and comorbid patients.
2153,"Knowledge about this growing infection is also increasing although many uncertainties remain, especially in the kidney transplant population."
2154,This manuscript presents a proposal for action with general and specific recommendations to protect and prevent infection in this vulnerable population such as kidney transplant recipients.
2155,"The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome."
2156,"Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold."
2157,"To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV."
2158,Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus.
2159,"The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor."
2160,"Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals."
2161,"Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans."

2164,"Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries."
2165,Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity.
2166,"A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures."
2167,The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23).
2168,"Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value."
2169,"It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained."
2170,"Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value."
2171,"With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction."
2172,"The global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high."
2173,"In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus."
2174,A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank.
2175,We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients.
2176,The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019–2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family.
2177,"In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25(th), 2019."
2178,"These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus."
2179,"Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of Betacoronavirus among animals and Rhinolophus of the bat family."
2180,"Through literature review and group discussion, Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association formulated an update on the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)."
2181,"The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with pangolins as a potential animal host."
2182,"Currently the main source of infection is NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious."
2183,The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact.
2184,People are all generally susceptible to the virus.
2185,"The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak."
2186,Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases.
2187,"The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death."
2188,"Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control."
2189,The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020.
2190,"Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7."
2191,Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity.
2192,"We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period."
2193,"Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6."
2194,"We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus."
2195,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global health and world's economy have been profound and unseen since the Spanish flu of 1918-19.
2196,"As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment."
2197,"This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic."
2198,"Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers."
2199,"The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy."
2200,"An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively."
2201,"Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter."
2202,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread."
2203,The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV.
2204,"As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19."
2205,"COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology."
2206,"Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV."
2207,"However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein."
2208,"Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed."
2209,COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV.
2210,Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV.
2211,The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV.
2212,The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity.
2213,"In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense."
2214,This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.
2215, Background The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.
2216,"The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated."
2217,Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
2218,"Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays."
2219,The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed.
2220,"Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively."
2221,Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected.
2222,"The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively."
2223,"The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset."
2224,"In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39."
2225,"Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007)."
2226,"Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006)."
2227,Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
2228,The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
2229,"Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike."
2230,Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows.
2231,"Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads."
2232,"We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training."
2233,We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision.
2234,"Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020."
2235,"ABSTRACTThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since December 2019."
2236,There is no cure for COVID-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months.
2237,"Here we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) genome in human lung epithelial cells."
2238,We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARS-CoV-2.
2239,The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV.
2240,Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses.
2241,The PAC-MAN approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.
2242,In this work we construct a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19.
2243,"Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available."
2244,We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region.
2245,"Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days."
2246,"Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values."
2247,We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations.
2248,We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown.
2249,We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.
2250, This article summarizes the likely benefits of melatonin in the attenuation of COVID-19 based on its putative pathogenesis.
2251,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients.
2252,"Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology."
2253,This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death.
2254,"Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens."
2255,"Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients."
2256,"Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile."
2257,There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.
2258,Additional experiments and clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation.
2259,"There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence."
2260,"Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses -- the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 -- exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date."
2261,"In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods."
2262,Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates.
2263,"Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009)."
2264,"Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins."
2265,The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.
2266,"In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence of interest is present."
2267,"Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches."
2268,"While any individual metagenomic dataset can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less accessible."
2269,"In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the keyword “virome”."
2270,In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the 2019-nCoV sequence (F. Wu et al.
2271,"2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3; P. Zhou et al."
2272,"2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7), we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al."
2273,"(Viruses 11:11, 2019, http://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979)."
2274,"Our observations are relevant to discussions of the derivation of 2019-nCoV and illustrate the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid sequences.ImportanceMeta-metagenomic searches allow for high-speed, low-cost identification of potentially significant biological niches for sequences of interest."
2275,"As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed."
2276,"In this report, we re-analyzed the computational approaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al."
2277,(https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al.
2278,"(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871), which concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1."
2279,"Results from our re-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, do not support the conclusions proposed by these manuscripts."
2280,"Based on our analyses and existing data of coronaviruses, we concluded that the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV are more likely to be mammals and birds than snakes, and that the “novel insertions” observed in the spike protein are naturally evolved from bat coronaviruses."
2281,"The seventh novel human infecting Betacoronavirus that causes pneumonia (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China."
2282,The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related.
2283,We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae.
2284,A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences.
2285,A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins.
2286,The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae.
2287,"Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus."
2288,The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins.
2289,"Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein."
2290,Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus.
2291,"Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov."
2292,NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model.
2293,"Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-nCoV."
2294,The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is of global concern and has recently emerged in the US.
2295,"In this paper, we construct a stochastic variant of the SEIR model to make a quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US West and East Coasts."
2296,The model is then fitted to current data and implemented using Runge-Kutta methods.
2297,"Our computation results predict that the number of new cases would peak around mid-April and begin to abate by July, and that the number of cases of COVID-19 might be significantly mitigated by having greater numbers of functional testing kits available for screening."
2298,The model also showed how small changes in variables can make large differences in outcomes and highlights the importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.
2299,The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global crisis due to its quick and wide spread over the world.
2300,A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19.
2301,"However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing models."
2302,"In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China."
2303,"We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, (4) it is expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the the selected provinces and cities."
2304,"IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown."
2305,The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China.
2306,We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities.
2307,Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy.
2308,We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading.
2309,We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan.
2310,"This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020."
2311,"We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming."
2312,"We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively."
2313,"Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21."
2314,This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming.
2315,"Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios."
2316,The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.
2317,Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
2318,Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions.
2319,"While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused."
2320,"Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP."
2321,"We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China."
2322,"The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%."
2323,Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions.
2324,We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.
2325,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has aroused widespread concern and attention from all over the world.
2326,Many articles have predicted the development of the epidemic.
2327,Most of them only use very basic SEIR model without considering the real situation.
2328,"In this paper, we build a model called e-ISHR model based on SEIR model."
2329,Then we add hospital system and time delay system into the original model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 better.
2330,"Besides, in order to take the government’s control and people’s awareness into consideration, we change our e-ISHR model into a 3-staged model which effectively shows the impact of these factors on the spread of the disease."
2331,"By using this e-ISHR model, we fit and predict the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and China except Hubei."
2332,We also change some of parameters in our model.
2333,The results indicate the importance of isolation and increasing the number of beds in hospital.
2334," The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2."
2335,"It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East."
2336,SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2337,"A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections."
2338,"The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed."
2339,"Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response."
2340,"Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection."
2341,Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort.
2342,Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.
2343,Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19.
2344,"Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection."
2345,National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.
2346,Background.
2347,"We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease."
2348,"After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad."
2349,Methodology.
2350,"We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights."
2351,"Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region."
2352,Results.
2353,"The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network."
2354,"There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities."
2355,"The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2."
2356,Conclusions.
2357,"We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria."
2358,"Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty."
2359,"Following the outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 in Wuhan, China late 2019, different countries have put in place interventions such as travel ban, proper hygiene, and social distancing to slow the spread of this novel virus."
2360,We evaluated the effects of travel bans in the Australia context and projected the epidemic until May 2020.
2361,Our modelling results closely align with observed cases in Australia indicating the need for maintaining or improving on the control measures to slow down the virus.
2362, Introduction : The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia in severely ill patients.
2363,Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19.
2364,Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19.
2365,"With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario."
2366,Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study.
2367,The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health.
2368,"These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19."
2369,The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens.
2370,"Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens."
2371,"In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing."
2372,A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images.
2373,"The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19."
2374,Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

2376,A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern
2377,Background: COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic.
2378,It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin.
2379,"SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein."
2380,"Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2."
2381,"Methods: We analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans."
2382,"In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels."
2383,"Results: We first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2."
2384,"Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients."
2385,"Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined."
2386,"Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans."
2387,"Conclusions: Through building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission."
2388," Background The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat."
2389,Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
2390,"Methods Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection."
2391,"Results The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin."
2392,"The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS."
2393,"Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems."
2394,"Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible)."
2395,Conclusion The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.
2396,COVID-19 and the Renin-Angiotensin System
2397,Modelling COVID-19 transmission: from data to intervention
2398,COVID-19 and the RAAS—a potential role for angiotensin II?
2399,: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.
2400,Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
2401,"Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions."
2402,We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
2403,"Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
2404,METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.
2405,Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.
2406,"Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile."
2407,RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC(50)=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC(50)=5.47 μM) in vitro.
2408,"Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance."
2409,CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
2410,"Background: A novel coronavirus named as ""SARS-CoV-2"" has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China."
2411,This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model.
2412,Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person).
2413,The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups.
2414,"We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively."
2415,"Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China."
2416,The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR).
2417,"Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P > 0.999)."
2418,"Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons)."
2419,The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons).
2420,"Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons)."
2421,The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons).
2422,Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.
2423,COVID-19; Considering the Prevalence of Schizophrenia in the Coming Decades
2424,"COVID-19, diabetes mellitus and ACE2: The conundrum"
2425,Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread.
2426,The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine.
2427,"We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system."
2428,"Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409."
2429,Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies.
2430,"The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected."
2431,"From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained."
2432,"Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration."
2433,These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals.
2434,"The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100 percent of children and 90 percent of adults."
2435,"Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective."
2436,"Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society."
2437,Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them.
2438,An in-depth annotation of the newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genome has revealed differences between 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses.
2439,"A systematic comparison identified 380 amino acid substitutions between these coronaviruses, which may have caused functional and pathogenic divergence of 2019-nCoV."
2440,COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pandemic by WHO.
2441,"Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease."
2442,Drug repositioning represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of fifty FDA-approved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identify potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
2443,We found a total of 24 drugs which exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 μM < IC50 < 10 μM) against SARS-CoV-2.
2444,"In particular, two FDA-approved drugs – niclosamide and ciclesonide – were notable in some respects."
2445,These drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities.
2446,"In near future, these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19."
2447,A recent study in this journal studied the genomes of the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 had undergone genetic recombination with SARS-related CoV1.
2448,"By February 14, 2020, a total of 66,576 confirmed cases of COVID-19, people infected with SARS-CoV-2, were reported in China, leading to 1,524 deaths, per the Chinese CDC (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/)."
2449,"Several full genomic sequences of this virus have been released for the study of its evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics2, 3, 4."
2450,"Here, we analyzed the potential mutations that may have evolved after the virus became epidemic among humans and also the mutations resulting in the human adaptation."
2451,"The sequences of BetaCoV were downloaded on February 3, 2020 from the GISAID platform5."
2452,"A total of 58 accessions were available, among which BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 is a known close relative of SARS-CoV-2."
2453,"Four accessions, namely, BetaCov/Italy/INM1/2020, BetaCov/Italy/INM2/2020, BetaCoV/Kanagawa/1/2020, and BetaCoV/USA/IL1/2020, were excluded because of the short-truncated sequences or multiple ambiguous nucleotides."
2454,A total of 54 accessions (Supplementary table 1) isolated from humans were utilized in the following analysis.
2455,The sequences NC_004718.3 of SARS coronavirus6 genes were utilized to define the protein products of SARS-CoV-2.
2456,"The protein sequences of ORF1ab, S, E, M, and N genes were translated, and all of the loci without experimental evidences were excluded."
2457,"First, the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with RaTG13, human SARS (NC_004718.3), bat SARS (DQ022305.2), and human MERS (NC_019843.3) by calculating the similarity in a given sliding window (Figure 1A)."
2458,"The sliding window was set to 500 for ORF1ab and S, and to 50 for proteins E, M, and N considering their short length."
2459,"SARS-CoV-2 were highly similar to RaTG13 isolated from bats, showing 96% identity based on the whole-nucleotide sequences and 83% based on the protein sequences, suggesting a bat zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2."
2460,"ORF1a, and the head of S seemed to have diverged from other beta coronaviruses."
2461,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly in China and the Chinese government took a series of policies to control the epidemic.
2462,"Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies."
2463,"Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies."
2464,"To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model."
2465,We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic.
2466,We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country.
2467,"Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474)."
2468,"By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections."
2469,"At the same time, we use the capital asset pricing model with dummy variable to evaluate the effects of the epidemic and official policies on the revenue of multiple industries."
2470,"Background: As reported by Iranian governments, the first cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections confirmed in Qom, Iran on February 19, 2020 (30 Bahman 1398)."
2471,The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country.
2472,This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported case data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran.
2473,"Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to March 18, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported case data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran."
2474,Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second and decreasing from 4.29 to 2.1 in the third and fourth weeks.
2475,Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is significantly larger than one and higher than previous estimated R_0 of COVID-19 in the early stages.
2476,"Based on the results, it is necessary to implement social distancing and a strict restriction on travelling to control the outbreak especially on Nowruz (Persian New Year)."
2477,"I estimate plausible true positive (TP) rates for the number of COVID-19 tests per day, most relevant when the number of test is on the same order of magnitude as number of infected persons."
2478,I then modify a standard SEIR model to model current growth patterns and detection rates in South Korea and New York state.
2479,"Although reducing transmission rates have the largest impact, increasing TP rates by ~10% in New York can have an impact equal to adding tens of thousands of new tests per day."
2480,Increasing both TP rates and tests per day together can have significant impacts and likely be more easily sustained than social distancing restrictions.
2481,"Systematic and standardized data collection, even beyond contact tracking, should be ongoing and quickly made available for research teams to maximize the efficacy of testing."
2482,The coronavirus 2019-nCoV epidemic: Is hindsight 20/20?
2483,"ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China, and has spread quickly to 72 countries to date."
2484,"COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]."
2485,"At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health."
2486,"However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19."
2487,"Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies."
2488,"Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics."
2489,"About one month after the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in Mainland China and SARS-CoV-2 migrated from China westward to Europe and then the U.S., the epidemiological data begin to provide important insights into the risks associated with the disease and the effectiveness of intervention strategies."
2490,"Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary."
2491,The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe.
2492,"South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous ""SKII"" variant."
2493,"While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first."
2494,The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies.
2495,"While containment merely prolongs the time the disease circulates until the proportion of immune people is high enough for ""herd immunity"", reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease."
2496,OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative impact of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on outcomes important to patients with COVID 19.
2497,DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review.
2498,"DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries, grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence)."
2499,L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database.
2500,"In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place."
2501,The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal.
2502,"ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation)."
2503,We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19.
2504,"Randomised trials evaluating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes."
2505,"Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias."
2506,We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.
2507,"A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2508,We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates.
2509,ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is considered necessary.
2510,"The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media."
2511,Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread.
2512,These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs.
2513,"Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing."
2514,"Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread."
2515,"Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people."
2516,Time horizon: 200 days.
2517,Interventions: 1.
2518,Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2.
2519,Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2).
2520,Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2.
2521,Results of Base-Case analysis: The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1 versus 432 in strategy 2.
2522,"The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death."
2523,Results of sensitivity analysis: The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death.
2524,"Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening."
2525,This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects.
2526,Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations.
2527,"In addition, we rely on current published parameters that might not reliably reflect infection dynamics."
2528,"An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV."
2529,"The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug."
2530,"In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2."
2531,"Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high."
2532,"The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes."
2533,"Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV."
2534,"COVID-19 is having a great impact on public health, mortality and economy worldwide, in spite of the efforts to prevent its epidemy."
2535,"The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions."
2536,Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak.
2537,"In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered."
2538,"The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed."
2539,"Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies."
2540,Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China.
2541,"Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression."
2542,"Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen."
2543,"The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected."
2544,The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model.
2545,Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05.
2546,"Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere."
2547,A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days.
2548,"Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects."
2549,Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test.
2550,"Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk."
2551,The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes.
2552,"Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence."
2553,The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR.
2554,Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses.
2555,RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples.
2556,This test was performed in under 30 minutes.
2557,This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.
2558,Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission
2559, Objectives Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives.
2560,The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.
2561,"Methods In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics."
2562,"The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike."
2563,"Results Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42."
2564,Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ).
2565,The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.
2566,Conclusions We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.
2567,Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol.
2568,These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.
2569,The 2019 Novel Coronavirus: A Crown Jewel of Pandemics?
2570,"We use human mobility models, for which we are experts, and attach a virus infection dynamics to it, for which we are not experts but have taken it from the literature, including recent publications."
2571,This results in a virus spreading dynamics model.
2572,"The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state."
2573,Recommendations for improvement are welcome.
2574,We come to the following conclusions: 1.
2575,Complete lockdown works.
2576,"About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down."
2577,"This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality."
2578,"Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown."
2579,2.
2580,"As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier."
2581,This is based on the following insights: a.
2582,"Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed."
2583,b.
2584,There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown.
2585,"Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large."
2586,c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements.
2587,3.
2588,"Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics."
2589,"It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier."
2590,4.
2591,Infections in public transport play an important role.
2592,"In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20%."
2593,"Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known."
2594,"-- This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates."
2595,5.
2596,"In our simulations, removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces, leisure activities, and in public transport may barely have been sufficient to control the infection dynamics if implemented early on."
2597,"Now according to our simulations it is too late for this, and (even) harsher measures will have to be initiated until possibly a return to such a restrictive, but still somewhat functional regime will again be possible."
2598,"Evidently, all of these results have to be taken with care."
2599,"They are based on preliminary infection parameters taken from the literature, used inside a model that has more transport/movement details than all others that we are aware of but still not enough to describe all aspects of reality, and suffer from having to write computer code under time pressure."
2600,"Optimally, they should be confirmed independently."
2601,"Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for ""complete lockdown"" at the latest when about 10% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities)."
2602,"What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e."
2603,tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine.
2604,The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful.
2605,"Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all."
2606,"We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime."
2607,"When opening up after lockdown, it would be important to know the true fraction of people who are already immune, since that would slow down the infection dynamics by itself."
2608,"For Wuhan, the currently available numbers report that only about 0.1% of the population was infected, which would be very far away from ""herd immunity""."
2609,"However, there have been and still may be many unknown infections."
2610,: Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy is significantly important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread.
2611,One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure.
2612,The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size.
2613,We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic.
2614,METHODS: The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19).
2615,"Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered."
2616,The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22.
2617,The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening.
2618,"RESULTS: Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23."
2619,"After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days."
2620,"CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education."
2621,"After March 23, although the possibility of massive transmission in the children's age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur."
2622,"Background: After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics."
2623,"However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation."
2624,"Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing."
2625,"We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively."
2626,The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave.
2627,"The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly."
2628,Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.
2629,"The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts."
2630,"The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1."
2631,"The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1–specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23."
2632,"Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM)."
2633,"These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8."
2634,"However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models."
2635,"Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo."
2636,"Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed."
2637,We firstly reported a case of acute myelitis in a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient.
2638,A 66-year-old man with COVID-19 was admitted with acute flaccid paralysis of bilateral lower limbs and urinary and bowel incontinence.
2639,All serum microbiological studies were negative except for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.
2640,Clinical findings could be ascribed to a post-infectious acute myelitis.
2641,"He was receiving treatment with ganciclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, moxifloxacin, dexamethasone, human immunoglobulin and mecobalamin."
2642,"With a diagnosis of post-infectious acute myelitis and comprehensive treatment, paralysis of bilateral lower extremities ameliorated."
2643,"After two times negative novel coronavirus RNA nasopharyngeal swabs tests, he was discharged and transferred to a designated hospital for isolation treatment and rehabilitation therapy."
2644,"An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019."
2645,"Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak."
2646,"After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed."
2647,"An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt."
2648,"In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1."
2649,"The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1."
2650,"The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020."
2651,"In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention."
2652,Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan.
2653,"The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393."
2654,Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China.
2655,"Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection."
2656,Advance of promising targets and agents against 2019-nCoV in China
2657,": Cancer and transplant patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs."
2658,This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19.
2659,"METHODS: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig."
2660,RESULTS: 89 studies were included.
2661,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19."
2662,"No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19."
2663,"COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19."
2664,"Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19."
2665,CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients.
2666,Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19.
2667,"The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies."
2668,"There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated."
2669,There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.
2670,The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) has induced a world-wide pandemic and subsequent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in order to control the spreading of the virus.
2671,NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs).
2672,"However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications."
2673,It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of the virus spreading.
2674,We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states.
2675,"Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch-Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of CoV spreading in different regions of Italy, we consistently found that the reproduction number was turned down to a range near 1 in all federal states."
2676,"We used the latest reproduction number as a starting point for the simulation of epidemic progression and varied the reproduction number, mimicking either release or strengthening of NPIs."
2677,"Germany is currently, April 3rd, 2020, at the border line of a reproduction number between the scenarios of major immunisation of the population or eradication of the virus."
2678,"We strongly recommend to keep all NPIs in place and suggest to even strengthen the measures in order to accelerate reaching the state of full control, thus, also limiting collateral damage of the NPIs in time."
2679,The COVID-19 infections in Pakistan are spreading at an exponential rate and a point may soon be reached where rigorous prevention measures would need to be adopted.
2680,Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community.
2681,We used an SIR model to predict the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan and compared the numbers with the reported cases on the national database.
2682,"Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively."
2683,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded RNA genome with positive-polarity.
2684,"To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains."
2685,"Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution."
2686,"However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81)."
2687,"The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection."
2688,"Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN)."
2689,"The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern."
2690,"In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure."
2691,"Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection."
2692,"Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts."
2693,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ 2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide with over 140,000 infected cases up to date."
2694,"Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza."
2695,"However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus."
2696,"Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale."
2697,"The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world."
2698,"Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best."
2699,"Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation."
2700,The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data.
2701,"Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak."
2702,This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.
2703,COVID-19: what is next for public health?
2704, SARS-CoV-2 causes the recent global COVID-19 public health emergency.
2705,ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
2706,"To predict the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed the key residues of ACE2 for recognizing S protein."
2707,"We found that most of the selected mammals including pets (dog and cat), pangolin and Circetidae mammals remained the most of key residues for association with S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2."
2708,The interaction interface between cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S protein was simulated through homology modeling.
2709,We identified that N82 in ACE2 showed a closer contact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than M82 in human ACE2.
2710,Our finding will provide important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and a new strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
2711,Baricitinib for COVID-19: a suitable treatment?
2712,– Authors' reply
2713,The epidemic of a novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19) becomes as a global threat.
2714,The aim of this study is first to find the best prediction models for daily confirmed cases in countries with high number of confirmed cases in the world and second to predict confirmed cases with these models in order to have more readiness in healthcare systems.
2715,"This study was conducted based on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 that were collected from the official website of Johns Hopkins University from January 22th, 2020 to March 1th, 2020."
2716,Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the trend of confirmed cases.
2717,Stata version 12 was used.
2718,Mainland China and Thailand had almost a stable trend.
2719,The trend of South Korea was decreasing and will become stable in near future.
2720,Iran and Italy had unstable trends.
2721,Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic.
2722,Investigating their protocol in this control like quarantine should be in the first line of other countries program
2723,"OBJECTIVES: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently recognized as a public health emergency of global concern."
2724,METHODS: We reviewed the currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control measures to be implemented by public health authorities.
2725,RESULTS: Some of the epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified.
2726,"However, there remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing guidance to public health authorities on control measures."
2727,CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases would be valuable.
2728,"Background An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions."
2729,It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020.
2730,"Methods We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China."
2731,A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19.
2732,"Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003."
2733,Results The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces.
2734,"By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS."
2735,While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19.
2736,"Conclusions Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well."
2737,"Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different."
2738,The duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.
2739,This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts.
2740,"This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences."
2741,The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system.
2742,This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available.
2743,The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper.
2744,The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies.
2745,"Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models."
2746,"Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life."
2747,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide."
2748,Previous studies suggested cat could be a potential susceptible animal of SARS-CoV-2.
2749,"Here, we investigated the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cats by detecting specific serum antibodies."
2750,"A cohort of serum samples were collected from cats in Wuhan, including 102 sampled after COVID-19 outbreak, and 39 prior to the outbreak."
2751,15 of 102 (14.7%) cat sera collected after the outbreak were positive for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
2752,"Among the positive samples, 11 had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a titer ranging from 1/20 to 1/1080."
2753,No serological cross-reactivity was detected between the SARS-CoV-2 and type I or II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).
2754,Our data demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 has infected cat population in Wuhan during the outbreak.
2755,"[Image: see text] As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, the careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed."
2756,"In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1."
2757,"However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions."
2758,"Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome."
2759,"In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human."
2760," Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
2761,Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia.
2762,MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks.
2763,Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV.
2764,Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS.
2765,"Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen."
2766,The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care.
2767,"There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation."
2768,": The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak is spreading in China, but it has not yet reached its peak."
2769,"Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection."
2770,Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks.
2771,"METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020."
2772,Time and location information on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software.
2773,"Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed."
2774,RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China respectively.
2775,"Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei."
2776,The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous day.
2777,"The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising."
2778,The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943.
2779,The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of cases.
2780,CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces.
2781,Some cities with a low number of cases showed a rapid increase in case load.
2782,"Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent new outbreaks."
2783,": Human infections with zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, have raised great public health concern globally."
2784,"Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans."
2785,"METHODS: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China."
2786,Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.
2787,"Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed."
2788,"RESULTS: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome."
2789,Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.
2790,One of these patients died.
2791,"Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown beta-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8-99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates."
2792,These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).
2793,"The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6-87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade."
2794,"Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs."
2795,"However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor."
2796,CONCLUSION: A novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.
2797,"The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population."
2798,"It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period."
2799,"With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate."
2800,"Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised."
2801,"By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th(,) 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions."
2802,We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak.
2803,Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation.
2804,"The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented."
2805," The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency."
2806,Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.
2807,Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.
2808,"Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming."
2809,A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.
2810,"Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry."
2811,Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.
2812,Telemedicine in the Era of COVID-19
2813," The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths."
2814,Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies.
2815,"We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans."
2816,"We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs."
2817,"We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry."
2818,"Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination."
2819,The recent emergence of the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 initiated a worldwide health crisis.
2820,"The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease, both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells."
2821,"In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells."
2822,"Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium."
2823,"We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2."
2824,"To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset."
2825,"We determined that sustentacular cells, which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, represents a prime candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection via the nose, and possibly for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia."
2826,A new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEICR) model with consideration of intercity travel and active intervention is proposed for predicting the spreading progression of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
2827,The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing.
2828,"The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed."
2829,"The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA."
2830,"By fitting the model with the data, we reveal that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively."
2831,"Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting."
2832,"Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA."
2833,"Finally, an assessment of the relative effectiveness of active intervention and personal protective measures is discussed."
2834,"With a highly vigilant public maintaining personal hygiene and exercising strict protective measures, the percentage of population infected can be further reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA."
2835, The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of global concern.
2836,Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity.
2837,"METHODS We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020."
2838,The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
2839,"RESULTS The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases."
2840,"Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients."
2841,"Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity."
2842,"Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores."
2843,"To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283."
2844,"As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 /L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%)."
2845,"In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01)."
2846,CONCLUSIONS This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases.
2847,"And importantly, lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease."
2848,FUNDING Key Project of Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau (2016ZB0202)
2849,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health."
2850,"To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined."
2851,"Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell–cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV."
2852,"We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain."
2853,"We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."
2854,"Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively."
2855,"EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2."
2856,"Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs."
2857,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
2858,Asymptomatic individuals in the context of COVID-19 are those subjects who are carriers of the virus but display no clinical symptoms.
2859,"Current evidence reveals that this sub-population is a major contributing factor in the propagation of this disease, while escaping detection by public health surveillance systems."
2860,"In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers."
2861,Our results indicate a basic reproduction number as high as 26.5.
2862,"The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 25\% per day during this period."
2863,"The model was applied to every county in the US to give estimates of mild, severe, and critical case severity, and also mortality."
2864,These estimates can be considered an upper bound.
2865,Importance: A strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive bio-specimen testing.
2866,"Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases."
2867,Design: Community survey.
2868,"Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms."
2869,Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste.
2870,Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19.
2871,"Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19."
2872,"Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative."
2873,"In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 ."
2874,"We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]."
2875,"When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus."
2876,Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus.
2877,"Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite."
2878,This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.
2879,One size does not fit all – Patterns of vulnerability and resilience in the COVID-19 pandemic and why heterogeneity of disease matters
2880,Preliminary evidence suggests that climate may modulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
2881,"Yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory, given high susceptibility is a core driver."
2882,"Here, we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic probing different scenarios of climate-dependence based on known coronavirus biology."
2883,"We find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 climate may drive only modest changes to pandemic size and duration."
2884,"Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth."
2885,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health concern as it continues to spread within China and beyond.
2886,"The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV)."
2887,Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments.
2888,"Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses can help identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking."
2889,"In this study, global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in coronavirus viral sequences."
2890,The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs.
2891,"However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures."
2892,Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health.
2893,The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%.
2894,The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities.
2895,"Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value."
2896,To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
2897,"Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect."
2898,The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long.
2899,We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease.
2900,Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
2901,Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study.
2902,"Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care."
2903,Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care.
2904,The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study.
2905,"Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery."
2906,"Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending."
2907,Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020.
2908,"Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease."

2912,The sudden increase of COVID-19 cases is putting a high pressure on healthcare services worldwide.
2913,"At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital."
2914,"To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity."
2915,"For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)."
2916,"In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention."
2917,"This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia."
2918,"Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate."
2919,"After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries."
2920,"In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies."
2921,"Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment."
2922,We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA).
2923,"Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1.5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around April 27."
2924,"The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown, but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100K cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents an 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak."
2925,Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia.
2926,"Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths."
2927,Pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm in severe COVID-19 patients
2928,"Background In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures."
2929,"Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020."
2930,510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled.
2931,"Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities."
2932,Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai.
2933,"During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001)."
2934,"Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001)."
2935,79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001).
2936,"95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures."
2937,Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.
2938,"Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan."
2939,"With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted."
2940,The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the repercussions of a lockdown strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought.
2941,"Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur."
2942,"It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk."
2943,"This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions."
2944,"Recently the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) pneumonia outbreak in China then the world, and the Number of infections and death continues to increases."
2945,Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics.
2946,It is still a question whether search engine data can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia.
2947,"Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia)."
2948,The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error.
2949,We further predict the out-of-the-set NCP confirmed cases and monitor that the next peak of new diagnoses will occur on February 16th and 17th.
2950,"Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020."
2951,The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly.
2952,Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent.
2953,"There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness."
2954,"However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness."
2955,"Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data."
2956,"Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals."
2957,"Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase."
2958,"Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions."
2959,"According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model."
2960,This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention.
2961,We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures.
2962,"Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov."
2963,"Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics."
2964,Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated.
2965,The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.
2966,"Due to the recent diffusion of COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios."
2967,"In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020."
2968,"In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm))."
2969,Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter.
2970,"Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy."
2971,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has been recognized as a global threat, and several studies are being conducted using various mathematical models to predict the probable evolution of this epidemic."
2972,These mathematical models based on various factors and analyses are subject to potential bias.
2973,"Here, we propose a simple econometric model that could be useful to predict the spread of COVID-2019."
2974,We performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction on the Johns Hopkins epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019.
2975,"For further comparison or for future perspective, case definition and data collection have to be maintained in real time."
2976,"While influenza viruses are a common respiratory pathogen, sporadic reports of conjunctivitis following human infection demonstrates the ability of this virus to cause disease outside of the respiratory tract."
2977,The ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection.
2978,"However, the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses, the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue, and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood."
2979,"Here, we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the ocular route."
2980,"We found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation, and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection."
2981,H5N1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the ocular route.
2982,"Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue was limited to the nares and upper trachea, unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues."
2983,"Despite high titers of replicating transmissible seasonal viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route, virus transmissibility to naïve contacts by respiratory droplets was reduced following ocular inoculation."
2984,These data improve our understanding of the mechanisms of virus spread following ocular exposure and highlight differences in the establishment of respiratory disease and virus transmissibility following use of different inoculation volumes and routes.
2985,Background.
2986,The newly emerged influenza A(H1N1) virus (new H1N1 virus) is causing the first influenza pandemic of this century.
2987,"Three influenza pandemics of the previous century caused variable mortality, which largely depended on the development of severe pneumonia."
2988,"However, the ability of the new H1N1 virus to cause pneumonia is poorly understood."
2989,Methods.
2990,The new H1N1 virus was inoculated intratracheally into ferrets.
2991,"Its ability to cause pneumonia was compared with that of seasonal influenza H1N1 virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus by using clinical, virological, and pathological analyses."
2992,Results.
2993,Our results showed that the new H1N1 virus causes pneumonia in ferrets intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 virus and by HPAI H5N1 virus.
2994,The new H1N1 virus replicated well throughout the lower respiratory tract and more extensively than did both seasonal H1N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the bronchi) and HPAI H5N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the alveoli).
2995,High loads of new H1N1 virus in lung tissue were associated with diffuse alveolar damage and mortality.
2996,Conclusions.
2997,The new H1N1 virus may be intrinsically more pathogenic for humans than is seasonal H1N1 virus.
2998,The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood.
2999,"Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals."
3000,Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer.
3001,"We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings."
3002,"However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air."
3003,"Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results."
3004,Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.
3005,"Although highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have yet to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently among humans, the increasing genetic diversity among these viruses and continued outbreaks in avian species underscore the need for more effective measures for the control and prevention of human H5N1 virus infection."
3006,Additional small animal models with which therapeutic approaches against virulent influenza viruses can be evaluated are needed.
3007,"In this study, we used the guinea pig model to evaluate the relative virulence of selected avian and human influenza A viruses."
3008,"We demonstrate that guinea pigs can be infected with avian and human influenza viruses, resulting in high titers of virus shedding in nasal washes for up to 5 days postinoculation (p.i.)"
3009,and in lung tissue of inoculated animals.
3010,"However, other physiologic indicators typically associated with virulent influenza virus strains were absent in this species."
3011,We evaluated the ability of intranasal treatment with human alpha interferon (α-IFN) to reduce lung and nasal wash titers in guinea pigs challenged with the reconstructed 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus or a contemporary H5N1 virus.
3012,"IFN treatment initiated 1 day prior to challenge significantly reduced or prevented infection of guinea pigs by both viruses, as measured by virus titer determination and seroconversion."
3013,The expression of the antiviral Mx protein in lung tissue correlated with the reduction of virus titers.
3014,We propose that the guinea pig may serve as a useful small animal model for testing the efficacy of antiviral compounds and that α-IFN treatment may be a useful antiviral strategy against highly virulent strains with pandemic potential.
3015,Several animal models are used to study influenza viruses.
3016,"Intranasal inoculation of animals with a liquid inoculum is one of the main methods used to experimentally infect animals with influenza virus; however, this method does not reflect the natural infection with influenza virus by contact or aerosol route."
3017,"Aerosol inhalation methods have been established with several influenza viruses for mouse and ferret models, but few studies have evaluated inoculation routes in a nonhuman primates (NHP) model."
3018,"Here, we performed the experimental infection of NHPs with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus via the aerosol route and demonstrated that aerosol infection had no effect on clinical outcome, but caused broader infection throughout all of the lobes of the lung compared with a non-aerosolized approach."
3019,Aerosol infection therefore represents an option for inoculation of NHPs in future studies.
3020, Category A arenaviruses as defined by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are human pathogens that could be weaponized by bioterrorists.
3021,"Many of these deadly viruses require biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment for all laboratory work, which limits traditional laboratory high-throughput screening (HTS) for identification of small molecule inhibitors."
3022,"For those reasons, a related BSL-2 New World arenavirus, Tacaribe virus, 67–78% identical to Junín virus at the amino acid level, was used in a HTS campaign where approximately 400,000 small molecule compounds were screened in a Tacaribe virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay."
3023,"Compounds identified in this screen showed antiviral activity and specificity against not only Tacaribe virus, but also the Category A New World arenaviruses (Junín, Machupo, and Guanarito)."
3024,"Drug resistant variants were isolated, suggesting that these compounds act through inhibition of a viral protein, the viral glycoprotein (GP2), and not through cellular toxicity mechanisms."
3025,"A lead compound, ST-294, has been chosen for drug development."
3026,"This potent and selective compound, with good bioavailability, demonstrated protective anti-viral efficacy in a Tacaribe mouse challenge model."
3027,This series of compounds represent a new class of inhibitors that may warrant further development for potential inclusion in a strategic stockpile.
3028,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in porcine herds worldwide.
3029,"Although both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have been extensively used, the emergence of highly virulent strains and the recurrent outbreaks even in vaccinated farms highlight the need of effective vaccines."
3030,Engineering of genetically defined live attenuated vaccines is a rational approach for novel vaccine development.
3031,"In this line, we engineered an attenuated virus based on the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome, expressing a chimeric spike protein from a virulent United States (US) PEDV strain."
3032,"This virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) was attenuated in highly-sensitive five-day-old piglets, as infected animals did not lose weight and none of them died."
3033,"In addition, the virus caused very minor tissue damage compared with a virulent virus."
3034,"The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate was also attenuated in three-week-old animals that were used to evaluate the protection conferred by this virus, compared with the protection induced by infection with a virulent PEDV US strain (PEDV-NVSL)."
3035,"The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus protected against challenge with a virulent PEDV strain, reducing challenge virus titers in jejunum and leading to undetectable challenge virus RNA levels in feces."
3036,"The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus induced a humoral immune response specific for PEDV, including neutralizing antibodies."
3037,"Altogether, the data indicated that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV is a promising vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV infection."
3038, It is a common laboratory practice to propagate viruses in cell culture.
3039,"While convenient, these methodologies often result in unintentional genetic alterations, which have led to adaptation and even attenuation in animal models of disease."
3040,"An example is the attenuation of hantaviruses (family: Bunyaviridae, genus: Hantavirus) when cultured in vitro."
3041,"In this case, viruses propagated in the natural reservoir species cause disease in nonhuman primates that closely mimics the human disease, but passaging in cell culture attenuates these viruses to the extent that do not cause any measurable disease in nonhuman primates."
3042,"As efforts to develop animal models progress, it will be important to take into account the influences that culture in vitro may have on the virulence of viruses."
3043,In this review we discuss this phenomenon in the context of past and recent examples in the published literature.
3044,Avian influenza A H5N1 remains unusual in its virulence for humans.
3045,"While infection of humans remains inefficient, many of those with H5N1 disease have a rapidly progressing viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death but its pathogenesis remains an enigma."
3046,"Comparisons in the virology and pathogenesis of human seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) and H5N1 in patients, animal models and in relevant primary human cell cultures remains instructive."
3047,"While the direct effects of viral replication and differences in the tropism of the virus for cells in the lower respiratory tract clearly contribute to the pathogenesis, we focus here on the possible contribution of the host innate immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease."
3048,Many respiratory viruses of humans originate from animals.
3049,"For instance, there are now eight paramyxoviruses, four coronaviruses and four orthomxoviruses that cause recurrent epidemics in humans but were once confined to other hosts."
3050,"In the last decade, several members of the same virus families have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans."
3051,"Fortunately, these viruses have not become established in humans, because they lacked the ability of sustained transmission between humans."
3052,"However, these outbreaks highlighted the lack of understanding of what makes a virus transmissible."
3053,"In part triggered by the relatively high frequency of occurrence of influenza A virus zoonoses and pandemics, the influenza research community has started to investigate the viral genetic and biological traits that drive virus transmission via aerosols or respiratory droplets between mammals."
3054,"Here we summarize recent discoveries on the genetic and phenotypic traits required for airborne transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses of subtypes H5, H7 and H9 and pandemic viruses of subtypes H1, H2 and H3."
3055,"Increased understanding of the determinants and mechanisms of respiratory virus transmission is not only key from a basic scientific perspective, but may also aid in assessing the risks posed by zoonotic viruses to human health, and preparedness for such risks."
3056,Influenza A virus is the respiratory pathogen responsible for influenza.
3057,Infection by the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus caused severe lower airway inflammation and pneumonia.
3058,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects the entire brachial tree, and was one of the commonest underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infection."
3059,"Although respiratory virus infections are the major causes of asthma exacerbation, the mechanism by which influenza exacerbates asthma is poorly understood."
3060,Animal models of disease comorbidity are crucial to understanding host-pathogen interactions and elucidating complex pathologies.
3061,"Existing murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatics show that asthmatic mice are highly resistant to influenza virus infection, which contradicts clinical observations in humans."
3062,"Here, we developed a murine model of influenza virus/asthma comorbidity using NC/Nga mice, which are highly sensitive to allergic reactions such as atopic dermatitis and allergic airway inflammation."
3063,This model was then used to examine the impact of allergic airway inflammation on lung pathology in the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infected mice.
3064,"The results showed that induction of acute allergic airway inflammation in pre-existing influenza virus infection had additive effects on exacerbation of lung pathology, which mirrors findings in human epidemiological studies."
3065,"In contrast, pre-existing allergic airway inflammation protected from subsequent influenza virus infection, which was compatible with those of previous murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatic mice."
3066,These variable outcomes of this murine model indicate that the temporal relation between allergic airway inflammation and influenza virus infection might play a critical role in asthma and influenza comorbidity.
3067,"Thus, this murine model will further our understanding of how influenza virus infection affects an asthmatic host and may aid the development of strategies to improve treatments and outcomes for asthmatics harboring influenza virus infection."
3068,"Respiratory viruses represent one of the most substantial infectious disease burdens to the human population today, and in particular, seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses pose a persistent threat to public health worldwide."
3069,"In recent years, advances in techniques used in experimental research have provided the means to better understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis and transmission of respiratory viruses, and thus more accurately model these infections in the laboratory."
3070,"Here, we briefly review the model systems used to study influenza virus infections, and focus particularly on recent advances that have increased our knowledge of these formidable respiratory pathogens."
3071,"In March 2013, three fatal human cases of infection with influenza A virus (H7N9) were reported in China."
3072,"Since then, human cases have been accumulating."
3073,"Given the public health importance of this virus, we performed a pathogenicity study of the H7N9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model, focusing on clinical aspects of disease, radiographic, histological, and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection."
3074,"Cynomolgus macaques developed transient, mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration."
3075,"Virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract, with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation."
3076,Virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat.
3077,"Histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans, albeit less severe, with diffuse alveolar damage, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, formation of hyaline membranes, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibroproliferative changes."
3078,Analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during H7N9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication.
3079,"Overall, H7N9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans, supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human H7N9 infection (H. N. Gao et al., N. Engl."

3081,"368:2277–2285, 2013, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1305584)."
3082, Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an anti-influenza drug in Japan.
3083,"Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for 2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains."
3084,This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA and reduces the viral load.
3085,"Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals."
3086,"Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection."
3087,"In addition to influenza, favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus, rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome."
3088,The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses.
3089,Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection.
3090,"Favipiravir is expected to be an important therapeutic agent for severe influenza, the next pandemic influenza strain, and other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not available."
3091,Influenza is a human pathogen that continues to pose a public health threat.
3092,The use of small mammalian models has become indispensable for understanding the virulence of influenza viruses.
3093,"Among numerous species used in the laboratory setting, only the ferret model is equally well suited for studying both the pathogenicity and transmissibility of human and avian influenza viruses."
3094,"Here, we compare the advantages and limitations of the mouse, ferret and guinea pig models for research with influenza A viruses, emphasizing the multifarious uses of the ferret in the assessment of influenza viruses with pandemic potential."
3095,"Research performed in the ferret model has provided information, support and guidance for the public health response to influenza viruses in humans."
3096,We highlight the recent and emerging uses of this species in influenza virus research that are advancing our understanding of virus-host interactions.
3097, Influenza A viruses causes a variety of illnesses in humans.
3098,"The most common infection, seasonal influenza, is usually a mild, self-limited febrile syndrome, but it can be more severe in infants, the elderly, and immunodeficient persons, in whom it can progress to severe viral pneumonitis or be complicated by bacterial superinfection, leading to pneumonia and sepsis."
3099,Seasonal influenza also occasionally results in neurologic complications.
3100,"Rarely, viruses that have spread from wild birds to domestic poultry can infect humans; such “avian influenza” can range in severity from mild conjunctivitis through the rapidly lethal disease seen in persons infected with the H5N1 virus that first emerged in Hong Kong in 1997."
3101,"To develop effective therapies for this wide range of diseases, it is essential to have laboratory animal models that replicate the major features of illness in humans."
3102,This review describes models currently in use for elucidating influenza pathogenesis and evaluating new therapeutic agents.
3103,Limited data on the relative contributions of different routes of transmission for influenza virus are available.
3104,"Person-to-person transmission is central to seasonal and pandemic spread; nevertheless, the modes of spread are a matter of ongoing debate."
3105,Resolution of this discussion is paramount to the development of effective control measures in health care and community settings.
3106,"Using the guinea pig model, we demonstrated that transmission of influenza A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus through the air is efficient, compared with spread through contaminated environmental surfaces (fomites)."
3107,We also examined the aerosol transmission efficiencies of 2 human influenza virus A strains and found that A/Panama/2007/1999 influenza virus transmitted more efficiently than A/Texas/36/1991 (H1N1) virus in our model.
3108,The data provide new and much-needed insights into the modes of influenza virus spread and strain-specific differences in the efficiency of transmission.
3109,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a recently emerged pathogen associated with severe human disease.
3110,Zoonotic spillover from camels appears to play a major role in transmission.
3111,"Because of logistic difficulties in working with dromedaries in containment, a more manageable animal model would be desirable."
3112,We report shedding and transmission of this virus in experimentally infected alpacas (n = 3) or those infected by contact (n = 3).
3113,Infectious virus was detected in all infected animals and in 2 of 3 in-contact animals.
3114,All alpacas seroconverted and were rechallenged 70 days after the original infection.
3115,"Experimentally infected animals were protected against reinfection, and those infected by contact were partially protected."
3116,Necropsy specimens from immunologically naive animals (n = 3) obtained on day 5 postinfection showed virus in the upper respiratory tract.
3117,These data demonstrate efficient virus replication and animal-to-animal transmission and indicate that alpacas might be useful surrogates for camels in laboratory studies.
3118,We find that the novel A/H1N1 influenza viruses exhibit very low genetic divergence and suffer strong purifying selection among human population and confirm that they originated from the reassortment of previous triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses including genomic segments from both avian and human lineages with North American and Eurasian swine lineages.
3119,The longer phylogenetic branch length to their nearest genetic neighbors indicates that the origin of the novel A/H1N1 is unlikely to be a very recent event.
3120,"Seventy-six new unique mutations are found to be monomorphically fixed in the novel A/H1N1 virus lineages, suggesting a role of selective sweep in the early evolution of this virus."
3121,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11262-009-0393-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
3122,"Recent gain-of-function studies in influenza A virus H5N1 strains revealed that as few as three amino-acid changes in the hemagglutinin protein confer the capacity for viral transmission between ferrets(1, 2)."
3123,"As transmission between ferrets is considered a surrogate indicator of transmissibility between humans, these studies raised concerns about the risks of gain-of-function influenza A virus research."
3124,Here we present an approach to strengthen the biosafety of gain-of-function influenza experiments.
3125,We exploit species-specific endogenous small RNAs to restrict influenza A virus tropism.
3126,"In particular, we found that the microRNA miR-192 was expressed in primary human respiratory tract epithelial cells as well as mouse lungs but absent from the ferret respiratory tract."
3127,"Incorporation of miR-192 target sites into influenza A virus did not prevent influenza replication and transmissibility in ferrets, but did attenuate influenza pathogenicity in mice."
3128,This molecular biocontainment approach should be applicable beyond influenza A virus to minimize the risk of experiments involving other pathogenic viruses.
3129,: Feed contaminated with feces from infected pigs is believed to be a potential route of transmission of porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV).
3130,"The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of commercial feed additives (e.i., acids, salt and sugar) to swine feed can be an effective strategy to inactive PDCoV."
3131,"RESULTS: Six commercial feed acids (UltraAcid P, Activate DA, KEMGEST, Acid Booster, Luprosil, and Amasil), salt, and sugar were evaluated."
3132,"The acids were added at the recommended concentrations to 5 g aliquots of complete feed, which were also inoculated with 1 mL of PDCoV and incubated for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days."
3133,"In another experiment, double the recommended concentrations of these additives were also added to the feed samples and incubated for 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 days."
3134,"All samples were stored at room temperature (~25 °C) followed by removal of aliquots at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days."
3135,Any surviving virus was eluted in a buffer solution and then titrated in swine testicular cells.
3136,Feed samples without any additive were used as controls.
3137,Both Weibull and log-linear kinetic models were used to analyze virus survival curves.
3138,"The presence of a tail in the virus inactivation curves indicated deviations from the linear behavior and hence, the Weibull model was chosen for characterizing the inactivation responses due to the better fit."
3139,"At recommended concentrations, delta values (days to decrease virus concentration by 1 log) ranged from 0.62–1.72 days, but there were no differences on virus survival among feed samples with or without additives at the manufacturers recommended concentrations."
3140,Doubling the concentration of the additives reduced the delta value to ≤ 0.28 days (P < 0.05) for all the additives except for Amasil (delta values of 0.86 vs. 4.95 days).
3141,"Feed additives that contained phosphoric acid, citric acid, or fumaric acid were the most effective in reducing virus survival, although none of the additives completely inactivated the virus by 10- days post-inoculation."
3142,"CONCLUSIONS: Commercial feed additives (acidifiers and salt) may be utilized as a strategy to decrease risk of PDCoV in feed, specially, commercial feed acidifiers at double the recommended concentrations reduced PDCoV survival in complete feed during storage at room temperature."
3143,"However, none of these additives completely inactivated the virus."
3144,"  It is clear from the experimental data that there are some similarities in RNA replication for all eukaryotic positive-stranded RNA viruses—that is, the mechanism of polymerization of the nucleotides is probably similar for all."
3145,It is noteworthy that all mechanisms appear to utilize host membranes as a site of replication.
3146,"Membranes appear to function not only as a way of compartmentalizing virus RNA replication but also appear to have a central role in the organization and functioning of the replication complex, and further studies in this area are needed."
3147,"Within virus supergroups, similarities are evident between animal and plant viruses—for example, in the nature and arrangements of replication genes and in sequence similarities of functional domains."
3148,"However, it is also clear that there has been considerable divergence, even within supergroups."
3149,"For example, the animal alpha-viruses have evolved to encode proteinases which play a central controlling function in the replication cycle, whereas this is not common in the plant alpha-like viruses and even when it occurs, as in the tymoviruses, the strategies that have evolved appear to be significantly different."
3150,Some of the divergence could be host-dependent and the increasing interest in the role of host proteins in replication should be fruitful in revealing how different systems have evolved.
3151,"Finally, there are virus supergroups that appear to have no close relatives between animals and plants, such as the animal coronavirus-like supergroup and the plant carmo-like supergroup."
3152,: Viral infection involves a large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and its host.
3153,These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins.
3154,"Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs."
3155,"Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a species rather than PPIs across different species such as PPIs between virus and host."
3156,"RESULTS: In this study, we developed a prediction model of virus-host PPIs, which is applicable to new viruses and hosts."
3157,"We tested the prediction model on independent datasets of virus-host PPIs, which were not used in training the model."
3158,"Despite a low sequence similarity between proteins in training datasets and target proteins in test datasets, the prediction model showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs."
3159,CONCLUSIONS: Our method will be particularly useful to find PPIs between host and new viruses for which little information is available.
3160,The program and support data are available at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/VirusHostPPI.
3161,"Livestock infectious diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), cause substantial economic damage to livestock farms and their related industries."
3162,"Among various causes of disease spread, airborne dispersion has previously been considered to be an important factor that could not be controlled by preventive measures to stop the spread of disease that focus on direct and indirect contact."
3163,Forecasting and predicting airborne virus spread are important to make time for developing strategies and to minimise the damage of the disease.
3164,To predict the airborne spread of the disease a modelling approach is important since field experiments using sensors are ineffective because of the rarefied concentrations of virus in the air.
3165,The simulation of airborne spread during past outbreaks required improvement both for farmers and for policy decision makers.
3166,In this study a free license computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to simulate airborne virus spread.
3167,Forecasting data from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) was directly connected in the developed model for real-time forecasting for 48 h in three-hourly intervals.
3168,"To reduce computation time, scalar transport for airborne virus spread was simulated based on a database for the CFD computed airflow in the investigated area using representative wind conditions."
3169,"The simulation results, and the weather data were then used to make a database for a web-based forecasting system that could be accessible to users."
3170,"Viruses of wild and domestic animals can infect humans in a process called zoonosis, and these events can give rise to explosive epidemics such as those caused by the HIV and Ebola viruses."
3171,"While humans are constantly exposed to animal viruses, those that can successfully infect and transmit between humans are exceedingly rare."
3172,The key event in zoonosis is when an animal virus begins to replicate (one virion making many) in the first human subject.
3173,"Only at this point will the animal virus first experience the selective environment of the human body, rendering possible viral adaptation and refinement for humans."
3174,"In addition, appreciable viral titers in this first human may enable infection of a second, thus initiating selection for viral variants with increased capacity for spread."
3175,We assert that host genetics plays a critical role in defining which animal viruses in nature will achieve this key event of replication in a first human host.
3176,"This is because animal viruses that pose the greatest risk to humans will have few (or no) genetic barriers to replicating themselves in human cells, thus requiring minimal mutations to make this jump."
3177,Only experimental virology provides a path to identifying animal viruses with the potential to replicate themselves in humans because this information will not be evident from viral sequencing data alone.
3178,Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important pneumovirus which causes acute respiratory disease in human beings.
3179,The viral infection leads to mild to severe respiratory symptoms depending on the age and immune status of the infected individual.
3180,Several groups across the world are working on the development of immunogens and therapy to manage HMPV infection with promising results under laboratory conditions but till date any virus specific vaccine or therapy has not been approved for clinical use.
3181,This minireview gives an overview of the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to manage HMPV infections.
3182," Respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality, as well as concern about pandemic spread."
3183,"Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1."
3184,"Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable."
3185,"Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats."
3186,"Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared."
3187,Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles.
3188,Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza.
3189,"Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared."
3190,"Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease."
3191,"The design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases, as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease outcome."
3192,No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.
3193,Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.
3194,"They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection."
3195,"Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies."
3196,We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.
3197,Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.
3198,"Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs."
3199,"Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis."
3200,"These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells."
3201,"The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus."
3202,Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.
3203,"The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology."
3204,This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.
3205,"  Animal viruses permeabilize cells at two well-defined moments during infection: (1) early, when the virus gains access to the cytoplasm, and (2) during the expression of the virus genome."
3206,"The molecular mechanisms underlying both events are clearly different; early membrane permeability is induced by isolated virus particles, whereas late membrane leakiness is produced by newly synthesized virus protein(s) that possess activities resembling ionophores or membrane-active toxins."
3207,"Detailed knowledge of the mechanisms, by which animal viruses permeabilize cells, adds to our understanding of the steps involved in virus replication."
3208,"Studies on early membrane permeabilization give clues about the processes underlying entry of animal viruses into cells; understanding gained on the modification by viral proteins of membrane permeability during virus replication indicates that membrane leakiness is required for efficient virus release from infected cells or virus budding, in the case of enveloped viruses."
3209,"In addition, the activity of these membrane-active virus proteins may be related to virus interference with host cell metabolism and with the cytopathic effect that develops after virus infection."
3210,: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has been widely reported and was considered the main cause of death in critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 infection.
3211,"However, no animal model has been developed for ARDS caused by infection with 2009 H1N1 virus."
3212,"Here, we present a mouse model of ARDS induced by 2009 H1N1 virus."
3213,"METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were inoculated with A/swine/Shandong/731/2009 (SD/09), which was a 2009 H1N1 influenza variant with a G222D mutation in the hemagglutinin."
3214,Clinical symptoms were recorded every day.
3215,Lung injury was assessed by lung water content and histopathological observation.
3216,"Arterial blood gas, leukocyte count in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and blood, virus titers, and cytokine levels in the lung were measured at various times post-inoculation."
3217,"Mice infected with SD/09 virus showed typical ARDS symptoms characterized by 60% lethality on days 8–10 post-inoculation, highly edematous lungs, inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema, lung hemorrhage, progressive and severe hypoxemia, and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines."
3218,"CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggested that we successfully established an ARDS mouse model induced by a virulent 2009 H1N1 variant without previous adaptation, which may be of benefit for evaluating the pathogenesis or therapy of human ARDS caused by 2009 H1N1 virus."
3219,: The influenza pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
3220,Animal models are useful in the study of influenza virus pathogenesis.
3221,"Because of various limitations in current laboratory animal models, it is essential to develop new alternative animal models for influenza virus research aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to virus infection in human."
3222,"METHOD: We investigated the replicative efficiency of influenza H1N1 virus (classic strain (Influenza A/PR/8/34), seasonal influenza isolate (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/02/09) and swine-origin human influenza virus (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/07/09)) at Day1,2,4,6 and 9 p.i."
3223,using TCID(50) and qPCR assay in tree shrew model.
3224,Body temperature was monitored in the morning and evening for 3 days before infection and for 14 days.
3225,"Seroconversion was detected by determining the neutralizing antibody titers against the challenge viruses in the pre- and exposure serum samples collected before infection and at 14 days p.i., respectively."
3226,Lungs and tracheas of tree shews were collected at day 14 post p.i.
3227,for histopathological analysis.
3228,"Lectinhistochemistry analysis was conducted to identify the distribution of SAα2,3 Gal and SAα2,6 Gal receptors in the lung and trachea."
3229,RESULTS: The infected tree shrew displayed mild or moderate systemic and respiratory symptoms and pathological changes in respiratory tracts.
3230,The human H1N1 influenza virus may replicate in the upper respiratory tract of tree shrews.
3231,"Analysis of the receptors distribution in the respiratory tract of tree shrews by lectinhistochemistry showed that sialic acid (SA)α2,6-Gal receptors were widely distributed in the trachea and nasal mucosa, whereas (SA)α2,3-Gal receptor was the main receptor in the lung tissue."
3232,"CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, tree shrew seemed to mimic well influenza virus infection in humans."
3233,We propose that tree shrews could be a useful alternative mammalian model to study pathogenesis of influenza H1N1 virus.
3234,Evolution of H1N1 influenza A outbreaks of the past 100 years is interesting and significantly complex and details of H1N1 genetic drift remains unknown.
3235,Here we investigated the clinical characteristics and immune cross-reactivity of significant historical H1N1 strains.
3236,"We infected ferrets with H1N1 strains from 1943, 1947, 1977, 1986, 1999, and 2009 and showed each produced a unique clinical signature."
3237,We found significant cross-reactivity between viruses with similar HA sequences.
3238,"Interestingly, A/FortMonmouth/1/1947 antisera cross-reacted with A/USSR/90/1977 virus, thought to be a 1947 resurfaced virus."
3239,"Importantly, our immunological data that didn't show cross-reactivity can be extrapolated to failure of past H1N1 influenza vaccines, ie."
3240,"1947, 1986 and 2009."
3241,"Together, our results help to elucidate H1N1 immuno-genetic alterations that occurred in the past 100 years and immune responses caused by H1N1 evolution."
3242,This work will facilitate development of future influenza therapeutics and prophylactics such as influenza vaccines.
3243,Isatis indigotica has a long history in treating virus infection and related symptoms in China.
3244,"Nevertheless, its antivirus evidence in animal studies is not satisfactory, which might be due to the lack of appropriate animal model."
3245,"Previously, we had utilized restraint stress to establish mouse H1N1 susceptibility model which was helpful in evaluating the anti-virus effect of medicines targeting host factors, such as type I interferon production."
3246,"In this study, this model was employed to investigate the effect and mechanism of indirubin, a natural bisindole alkaloid from Isatis indigotica, on influenza A virus susceptibility."
3247,"In the in vitro study, the stress hormone corticosterone was used to simulate restraint stress."
3248,Our results demonstrated that indirubin decreased the susceptibility to influenza virus with lowered mortality and alleviated lung damage in restraint-stressed mice model.
3249,"Moreover, indirubin promoted the expression of interferon-β and interferon inducible transmembrane 3."
3250,"In addition, indirubin maintained the morphology and function of mitochondria following influenza A virus infection."
3251,Further study revealed that indirubin promoted interferon-β production through promoting mitochondrial antiviral signaling pathway.
3252,Our study indicated that indirubin could be a candidate for the therapy of influenza.
3253, A murine model to study enteritis induced by bovine (BRV) and murine rotavirus (MRV) has been developed.
3254,"The course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods."
3255,Both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice.
3256,Rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with MRV or BRV and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation (HPI) period.
3257,"Following infection with 104 PFU of virus, diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction, as measured by xylose absorption, did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10–15 HPI."
3258,Immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5–8 HPI.
3259,The appearance of diarrheal symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated.
3260,The disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 × 102 PFU/mouse of BRV and 1 × 101 PFU/mouse of MRV.
3261,"On the basis of these results, MRV was found to be more virulent than BRV in this model."
3262,The model should prove useful for studies designed to assess rotavirus virulence genes and for vaccine protection studies.
3263,This work emphasizes the need for early sample collection for critical evaluation of any vaccine or antiviral agent using this model.
3264,Psychological stress is an important factor in susceptibility to many diseases.
3265,"Our laboratory has been investigating the impact of stress on the susceptibility to Theiler's virus-induced demyelination (TVID), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis."
3266,"Using immunodominant viral peptides specific for identification of either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells, stress reduced IFN-γ-producing virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen and CD8(+) T cells in the CNS."
3267,Expression of mRNA for the Th1 transcription factor T-bet and the Th2 transcription factor GATA-3 were decreased in spleen cells isolated from stressed mice.
3268,Cytokine production by cells isolated from the CNS or spleens following stimulation with virus indicated that stress decreased both type 1 and type 2 responses.
3269,"The adverse effects of stress were partially reversed by concurrent RU486 administration but mimicked by dexamethasone, indicating a major role for glucocorticoids."
3270,Global stress-induced immunosuppression resulted in higher levels of virus replication and dissemination.
3271,The higher viral load subsequently led to an earlier disease onset and more severe clinical and histological signs of demyelinating disease.
3272,"Our results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of MS, and suggest that stressful events during early infection with an agent capable of inducing demyelination may result in immunosuppression and failure to eliminate the pathogen, which in turn may lead to the development of MS."
3273," Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising form of gene therapy for cancer, employing nature’s own agents to find and destroy malignant cells."
3274,"The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to this very topical field of research and to point out some of the current observations, insights and ideas circulating in the literature."
3275,We have strived to acknowledge as many different oncolytic viruses as possible to give a broader picture of targeting cancer using viruses.
3276,"Some of the newest additions to the panel of oncolytic viruses include the avian adenovirus, foamy virus, myxoma virus, yaba-like disease virus, echovirus type 1, bovine herpesvirus 4, Saimiri virus, feline panleukopenia virus, Sendai virus and the non-human coronaviruses."
3277,"Although promising, virotherapy still faces many obstacles that need to be addressed, including the emergence of virus-resistant tumor cells."
3278,"H9N2 Avian influenza virus has repeatedly infected humans and other mammals, which highlights the need to determine the pathogenicity and the corresponding mechanism of this virus for mammals."
3279,"In this study, we found two H9N2 viruses with similar genetic background but with different pathogenicity in mice."
3280,"The A/duck/Nanjing/06/2003 (NJ06) virus was highly pathogenic for mice, with a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of 10(2.83) 50% egg infectious dose (EID(50)), whereas the A/duck/Nanjing/01/1999 (NJ01) virus was low pathogenic for mice, with a MLD(50) of >10(6.81) EID(50)."
3281,Further studies showed that the NJ06 virus grew faster and reached significantly higher titers than NJ01 in vivo and in vitro.
3282,"Moreover, the NJ06 virus induced more severe lung lesions, and higher levels of inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs than NJ01 did."
3283,"However, only 12 different amino acid residues (HA-K157E, NA-A9T, NA-R435K, PB2-T149P, PB2-K627E, PB1-R187K, PA-L548M, PA-M550L, NP-G127E, NP-P277H, NP-D340N, NS1-D171N) were found between the two viruses, and all these residues except for NA-R435K were located in the known functional regions involved in interaction of viral proteins or between the virus and host factors."
3284,", our results suggest that multiple amino acid differences may be responsible for the higher pathogenicity of the NJ06 virus for mice, resulting in lethal infection, enhanced viral replication, severe lung lesions, and excessive inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs."
3285,These observations will be helpful for better understanding the pathogenic potential and the corresponding molecular basis of H9N2 viruses that might pose threats to human health in the future.
3286," Influenza A viruses cause respiratory infection in humans and pigs, and some serotypes can be transmitted between these species."
3287,"The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in the spring of 2009 quickly led to a worldwide pandemic in humans, with subsequent introduction of the virus to pig populations."
3288,"Following a widespread infection in the human population in Norway, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was introduced to the influenza A naïve Norwegian pig population, and within a few months pigs in more than one third of Norwegian swine herds had antibodies against the virus."
3289,"A cross-sectional study was performed on all swine nucleus and multiplier herds in Norway to analyze risk factors for introduction of infection, and the preventive effects of recommended biosecurity practices."
3290,"A surveillance program provided information on infection status of the study herds, and a questionnaire was administered to all 118 nucleus and multiplier herds to collect information on herd variables."
3291,The surveillance program revealed that pigs in 42% of the herds had antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.
3292,The incidence of serologically positive pigs was similar in both multiplier herds (41%) and closed nucleus herds (43%).
3293,"Multivariable logistic regression showed that presence of farm staff with influenza-like illness (ILI) (OR=4.15, CI 1.5–11.4, p =0.005) and herd size (OR=1.01, CI 1–1.02, p =0.009) were risk factors for infection."
3294,"The rapid and widespread seroconversion for antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the Norwegian pig population can be explained by the emergence of a novel virus that is readily transmitted between people and swine in a largely susceptible population of humans, and an entirely naïve population of pigs."
3295,"Epidemiological data suggest the notion that in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an acquired autoimmune disease and the cause may be an environmental factor(s), probably infectious, in genetically susceptible individuals."
3296,Several cases of viral induced demyelinatimg encephalomyelitis in human beings and in experimental models as well as the presence of IgG oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate that the infectious factor may be viral.
3297,"However, the absence of a specific virus identification in MS central nervous system may hardly support this notion."
3298,"On the other hand, the partial response of patients with MS to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy support the evidence of an autoimmune etiology for MS."
3299,"However, the autoimmune hypothesis shares the same criticism with the infectious one in that no autoantigen(s) specific to and causative for MS has ever been identified."
3300,"Nevertheless, the absence of identifiable infectious agent, especially viral does not rule out its presence at a certain time – point and the concomitant long term triggering of an autoimmune cascade of events thereafter."
3301,Several concepts have emerged in an attempt to explain the autoimmune mechanisms and ongoing neurodegeneration in MS on the basis of the infectious – viral hypothesis.
3302," As the threat of exposure to emerging and reemerging viruses within a naive population increases, it is vital that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune response be thoroughly investigated."
3303,"By using animal models in this endeavor, the response to viruses can be studied in a more natural context to identify novel drug targets, and assess the efficacy and safety of new products."
3304,This is especially true in the advent of the Food and Drug Administration's animal rule.
3305,"Although no one animal model is able to recapitulate all the aspects of human disease, understanding the current limitations allows for a more targeted experimental design."
3306,"Important facets to be considered before an animal study are the route of challenge, species of animals, biomarkers of disease, and a humane endpoint."
3307,"This chapter covers the current animal models for medically important human viruses, and demonstrates where the gaps in knowledge exist."
3308, Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) are being developed as potential HIV-1 vaccine candidates.
3309,"To characterize the in vivo replication and dissemination of rVSV vectors in mice, high doses of a highly attenuated vector expressing HIV-1 Gag, rVSVIN-N4CT9-Gag1, and a prototypic reference virus, rVSVIN-HIVGag5, were delivered intramuscularly (IM), intranasally (IN), or intravenously (IV)."
3310,"We used quantitative, real-time RT-PCR (Q-PCR) and standard plaque assays to measure the temporal dissemination of these viruses to various tissues."
3311,"Following IM inoculation, both viruses were detected primarily at the injection site as well as in draining lymph nodes; neither virus induced significant weight loss, pathologic signs, or evidence of neuroinvasion."
3312,"In contrast, following IN inoculation, the prototypic virus was detected in all tissues tested and caused significant weight loss leading to death."
3313,"IN administration of rVSVIN-N4CT9-Gag1 resulted in detection in numerous tissues (brain, lung, nasal turbinates, and lymph nodes) albeit in significantly reduced levels, which caused little or no weight loss nor any mortality."
3314,"Following IV inoculation, both prototypic and attenuated viruses were detected by Q-PCR in all tissues tested."
3315,"In contrast to the prototype, rVSVIN-N4CT9-Gag1 viral loads were significantly lower in all organs tested, and no infectious virus was detected in the brain following IV inoculation, despite the presence of viral RNA."
3316,These studies demonstrated significant differences in the biodistribution patterns of and the associated pathogenicity engendered by the prototypic and attenuated vectors in a highly susceptible host.
3317," SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) administered intranasally and intratracheally to rhesus, cynomolgus and African Green monkeys (AGM) replicated in the respiratory tract but did not induce illness."
3318,The titer of serum neutralizing antibodies correlated with the level of virus replication in the respiratory tract (AGM>cynomolgus>rhesus).
3319,Moderate to high titers of SARS-CoV with associated interstitial pneumonitis were detected in the lungs of AGMs on day 2 and were resolving by day 4 post-infection.
3320,"Following challenge of AGMs 2 months later, virus replication was highly restricted and there was no evidence of enhanced disease."
3321,"These species will be useful for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines, but the lack of apparent clinical illness in all three species, variability from animal to animal in level of viral replication, and rapid clearance of virus and pneumonitis in AGMs must be taken into account by investigators considering the use of these species in efficacy and challenge studies."
3322,"In 2015, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea through nosocomial transmission and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula."
3323,"To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, only limited therapeutic options are available."
3324,"To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, for their activity against the isolate."
3325,The primary assay confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6.
3326,"Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively."
3327,"Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria drug (atovaquone; TI >34), an inhalable corticosteroid (ciclesonide; TI >6), etc."
3328,"Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treating MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for agents against a wider range of coronavirus-related illnesses, including the currently emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak."
3329,Any possible role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of severe COVID19 infections?
3330,A lesson from urology
3331,No evidence supports the use of ether and chloroform inhalation for treating COVID-19
3332,After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012.
3333,"Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
3334,The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security.
3335,"Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown."
3336,"The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population."
3337,"We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV."
3338,"Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software."
3339,"Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study."
3340,"The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time."
3341,"It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication."
3342,The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.
3343,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan since December 2019 [1] has quickly spread to twenty-five countries [2], caused more than 44,000 cases and 1,000 deaths so far [3]."
3344,"The fast sharing of 2019-nCoV genomes in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) provides a valuable dataset for 2019-nCoV haplotype network analysis, which is crucial for transmission and evolutionary track surveillance and secondary outbreak prevention."
3345,We called single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) for all the 84 2019-nCov genomes in GISAID using MN908947 as the reference.
3346,Genomes with same SNVs are grouped into a haplotype (shown as a pie chart node in Fig.
3347,"1, see Tab."
3348,"S1 for the accessions), then the network is constructed using the median join [4] method in popART [5]."
3349,"We found the 2019-nCoV haplotype network has obvious characteristics of single origin from haplotype hap_011: first, the network is star-like, centralized on the haplotype hap_011; second, hap_011 has the largest sample size and majority of the samples are from Hubei province—where outbreak originated (Tab."
3350,"S1); third, most of satellite haplotypes are also from Hubei (Fig."
3351,"1); fourth, the average collection dates of hap_011 (has 0 mutation relative to MN908947) is earlier than all other mutation groups (Fig."
3352,S1).
3353,"The single origin of 2019-nCov indicates a persistent animal to human transmission is unlikely, otherwise, multiple nodes with above characteristics should be observed."
3354,"Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON)."
3355,"Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers."
3356,"Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series."
3357,"These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2)."
3358,"The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7)."
3359,"Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12)."
3360,No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified.
3361,One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus.
3362,"Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies."
3363,"Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin."
3364,"Eighteen studies reported potential drug-related adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin."
3365,"Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made."
3366,"However, it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies), which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy."
3367, Background Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
3368,"To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown."
3369,"Patients and methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China."
3370,"The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020."
3371,"Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death."
3372,Results 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male.
3373,Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0).
3374,"Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%)."
3375,8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission.
3376,"The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%)."
3377,"The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%)."
3378,15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%.
3379,"If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037)."
3380,"Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010)."
3381,Conclusions Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.
3382,It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.
3383,"A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of a massive outbreak of atypical pneumonia originating at Wuhan, Hubei province, China."
3384,"Involved in the formation of the coronavirus replication complex, the viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) represents an attractive target for therapy."
3385,We determined the crystal structure of the unliganded Mpro at 1.75 Å resolution and used this structure to guide optimization of a series of alpha-ketoamide inhibitors.
3386,The main goal of the optimization efforts was improvement of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds.
3387,We further describe 1.95- and 2.20-Å crystal structures of the complex between the enzyme and the most potent alpha-ketoamide optimized this way.
3388,These structures will form the basis for further development of these compounds to antiviral drugs.
3389,"On January 9 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the identification, by Chinese Health authorities, of a novel coronavirus, further classified as SARS-CoV-2 responsible of a disease (COVID-19) ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe respiratory involvement."
3390,"On March 9 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic."
3391,Italy is the second most affected country by COVID-19 infection after China.
3392,The “L.
3393,"Spallanzani” National Institute for the Infectious Diseases, IRCCS, Rome, Italy, has been the first Italian hospital to admit and manage patients affected by COVID-19."
3394,"Hereby, we show our recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients, based on very limited clinical evidences; they should be considered as expert opinions, which may be modified according to newly produced literature data."
3395,The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths.
3396,It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet.
3397,"Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle."
3398,"However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear."
3399,"Herein, we have determined the 2.7 Å crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein."
3400,"Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct."
3401,Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the β-sheet core.
3402,"Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2."
3403,Traditional Chinese medicine is a resource for drug discovery against 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
3404, As antiviral drug resistance develops and new viruses emerge there is a pressing need to develop strategies to rapidly develop antiviral therapeutics.
3405,Here we use phospho-specific flow cytometry to assess perturbations of many different cellular signaling pathways during treatment with drug combinations that are highly effective in blocking Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection.
3406,"We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection."
3407,"We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation."
3408,We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of HSV-1 infection.
3409,"Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection."
3410,The outcomes of the approach we present highlight the importance of analyzing how antiviral drugs modulate cellular and pathogen-induced signaling as a method to discover new drug therapy targets.
3411," Intestinal lymphatic transport has been shown to be an absorptive pathway following oral administration of lipids and an increasing number of lipophilic drugs, which once absorbed, diffuse across the intestinal enterocyte and while in transit associate with secretable enterocyte lipoproteins."
3412,"The chylomicron-associated drug is then secreted from the enterocyte into the lymphatic circulation, rather than the portal circulation, thus avoiding the metabolically-active liver, but still ultimately returning to the systemic circulation."
3413,"Because of this parallel and potentially alternative absorptive pathway, first-pass metabolism can be reduced while increasing lymphatic drug exposure, which opens the potential for novel therapeutic modalities and allows the implementation of lipid-based drug delivery systems."
3414,"This review discusses the physiological features of the lymphatics, enterocyte uptake and metabolism, links between drug transport and lipid digestion/re-acylation, experimental model (in vivo, in vitro, and in silico) of lymphatic transport, and the design of lipid- or prodrug-based drug delivery systems for enhancing lymphatic drug transport."
3415,Recent drug discovery efforts have utilized high throughput screening (HTS) of large chemical libraries to identify compounds that modify the activity of discrete molecular targets.
3416,"The molecular target approach to drug screening is widely used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, because of the amount of knowledge now available regarding protein structure that has been obtained by computer simulation."
3417,"The molecular target approach requires that the structure of target molecules, and an understanding of their physiological functions, is known."
3418,"This approach to drug discovery may, however, limit the identification of novel drugs."
3419,"As an alternative, the phenotypic- or pathway-screening approach to drug discovery is gaining popularity, particularly in the academic sector."
3420,"This approach not only provides the opportunity to identify promising drug candidates, but also enables novel information regarding biological pathways to be unveiled."
3421,Reporter assays are a powerful tool for the phenotypic screening of compound libraries.
3422,"Of the various reporter genes that can be used in such assays, those encoding secreted proteins enable the screening of hit molecules in both living cells and animals."
3423,Cell- and animal-based screens enable simultaneous evaluation of drug metabolism or toxicity with biological activity.
3424,"Therefore, drug candidates identified in these screens may have increased biological efficacy and a lower risk of side effects in humans."
3425,"In this article, we review the reporter bioassay systems available for phenotypic drug discovery."
3426," Advances in bioinformatics and protein modeling algorithms, in addition to the enormous increase in experimental protein structure information, have aided in the generation of databases that comprise homology models of a significant portion of known genomic protein sequences."
3427,"Currently, 3D structure information can be generated for up to 56% of all known proteins."
3428,"However, there is considerable controversy concerning the real value of homology models for drug design."
3429,This review provides an overview of the latest developments in this area and includes selected examples of successful applications of the homology modeling technique to pharmaceutically relevant questions.
3430,"In addition, the strengths and limitations of the application of homology models during all phases of the drug discovery process are discussed."
3431, Investigators examined antimicrobial drug use practices and reason for treatment as part of a large on-farm observational study of cow–calf herds from western Canada.
3432,"Reason for treatment and antimicrobial drug use (AMU) were described using data collected during the calving season (January 1 to June 30, 2002)."
3433,"The study included 28,573 calves and 36,634 cows and heifers from 203 beef herds."
3434,All herds had more than 50 cows.
3435,Individual animal treatment records and a herd-level standardized questionnaire were collected from every herd.
3436,"During the period of January 1 to June 30, 2002 at least one treatment was reported in 14% (95% CI, 11–17) of calves and 2.7% (95% CI, 2.2–3.4) of cows and heifers from these herds."
3437,The median percent of calves reported as treated per farm was 6.5% (range 0–100%) while the median percent of cows and heifers reported as treated was 0.9% (range 0–15%).
3438,Antimicrobial drugs used during the calving season were primarily for disease treatment rather than prevention or growth promotion.
3439,Diarrhea was the primary reason for treating calves and metritis was the primary reason for treating cows.
3440,Parenteral antimicrobial drugs were the most common formulation used in both calves and cows.
3441,"The most commonly used antimicrobial drugs in these herds were tetracyclines, sulphonamides, and florfenicol."
3442,"This study provides baseline estimates of the frequency of antimicrobial drug exposure, the types of drugs used, and diseases treated in these cow–calf herds."
3443,The challenges identified in collecting these data can be used to improve the design of future on-farm studies.
3444,"Nanoscience and nanotechnology shows immense interest in various areas of research and applications, including biotechnology, biomedical sciences, nanomedicine, and veterinary medicine."
3445,"Studies and application of nanotechnology was explored very extensively in the human medical field and also studies undertaken in rodents extensively, still either studies or applications in veterinary medicine is not up to the level when compared to applications to human beings."
3446,The application in veterinary medicine and animal production is still relatively innovative.
3447,"Recently, in the era of health care technologies, Veterinary Medicine also entered into a new phase and incredible transformations."
3448,"Nanotechnology has tremendous and potential influence not only the way we live, but also on the way that we practice veterinary medicine and increase the safety of domestic animals, production, and income to the farmers through use of nanomaterials."
3449,"The current status and advancements of nanotechnology is being used to enhance the animal growth promotion, and production."
3450,"To achieve these, nanoparticles are used as alternative antimicrobial agents to overcome the usage alarming rate of antibiotics, detection of pathogenic bacteria, and also nanoparticles being used as drug delivery agents as new drug and vaccine candidates with improved characteristics and performance, diagnostic, therapeutic, feed additive, nutrient delivery, biocidal agents, reproductive aids, and finally to increase the quality of food using various kinds of functionalized nanoparticles, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, micellar nanoparticles, and metal nanoparticles."
3451,It seems that nanotechnology is ideal for veterinary applications in terms of cost and the availability of resources.
3452,The main focus of this review is describes some of the important current and future principal aspects of involvement of nanotechnology in Veterinary Medicine.
3453,"However, we are not intended to cover the entire scenario of Veterinary Medicine, despite this review is to provide a glimpse at potential important targets of nanotechnology in the field of Veterinary Medicine."
3454,"Considering the strong potential of the interaction between the nanotechnology and Veterinary Medicine, the aim of this review is to provide a concise description of the advances of nanotechnology in Veterinary Medicine, in terms of their potential application of various kinds of nanoparticles, secondly we discussed role of nanomaterials in animal health and production, and finally we discussed conclusion and future perspectives of nanotechnology in veterinary medicine."
3455,Psychoimmunology and infection
3456, 3D organ models have gained increasing attention as novel preclinical test systems and alternatives to animal testing.
3457,"Over the years, many excellent in vitro tissue models have been developed."
3458,"In parallel, microfluidic organ-on-a-chip tissue cultures have gained increasing interest for their ability to house several organ models on a single device and interlink these within a human-like environment."
3459,"In contrast to these advancements, the development of human disease models is still in its infancy."
3460,"Although major advances have recently been made, efforts still need to be intensified."
3461,"Human disease models have proven valuable for their ability to closely mimic disease patterns in vitro, permitting the study of pathophysiological features and new treatment options."
3462,"Although animal studies remain the gold standard for preclinical testing, they have major drawbacks such as high cost and ongoing controversy over their predictive value for several human conditions."
3463,"Moreover, there is growing political and social pressure to develop alternatives to animal models, clearly promoting the search for valid, cost-efficient and easy-to-handle systems lacking interspecies-related differences."
3464,"In this review, we discuss the current state of the art regarding 3D organ as well as the opportunities, limitations and future implications of their use."
3465, Background The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreaks.
3466,"The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy."
3467,"Method We searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS."
3468,"Results Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct."
3469,"Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model."
3470,There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon.
3471,The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is in a randomized control trial.
3472,Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observational studies.
3473,"Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation."
3474,There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.
3475,Only one such study is planned for randomization and is pending completion.
3476,The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b.
3477,A fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy.
3478,Conclusion Despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV.
3479,Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials.
3480,"In order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for MERS-CoV infection, repurposing old drugs against MERS-CoV is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings."
3481,": Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR(−/−) mice) reproduce relevant aspects of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in humans, including liver damage."
3482,"We aimed at characterizing the liver pathology in CCHF virus-infected IFNAR(−/−) mice by immunohistochemistry and employed the model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 against CCHF virus."
3483,METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CCHF virus-infected IFNAR(−/−) mice died 2–6 days post infection with elevated aminotransferase levels and high virus titers in blood and organs.
3484,"Main pathological alteration was acute hepatitis with extensive bridging necrosis, reactive hepatocyte proliferation, and mild to moderate inflammatory response with monocyte/macrophage activation."
3485,Virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered in the necrotic areas.
3486,"Ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 suppressed virus replication in vitro by ≥3 log units (IC(50) 0.6–2.8 µg/ml; IC(90) 1.2–4.7 µg/ml)."
3487,"Ribavirin [100 mg/(kg×d)] did not increase the survival rate of IFNAR(−/−) mice, but prolonged the time to death (p<0.001) and reduced the aminotransferase levels and the virus titers."
3488,Arbidol [150 mg/(kg×d)] had no efficacy in vivo.
3489,"Animals treated with T-705 at 1 h [15, 30, and 300 mg/(kg×d)] or up to 2 days [300 mg/(kg×d)] post infection survived, showed no signs of disease, and had no virus in blood and organs."
3490,Co-administration of ribavirin and T-705 yielded beneficial rather than adverse effects.
3491,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Activated hepatic macrophages and monocyte-derived cells may play a role in the proinflammatory cytokine response in CCHF.
3492,Clustering of infected hepatocytes in necrotic areas without marked inflammation suggests viral cytopathic effects.
3493,T-705 is highly potent against CCHF virus in vitro and in vivo.
3494,"Its in vivo efficacy exceeds that of the current standard drug for treatment of CCHF, ribavirin."
3495,"This article reviews the pulmonary route of administration, aerosol delivery devices, characterization of pulmonary drug delivery systems, and discusses the rationale for inhaled delivery of siRNA."
3496,Diseases with known protein malfunctions may be mitigated through the use of siRNA therapeutics.
3497,"The inhalation route of administration provides local delivery of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of various pulmonary diseases, however barriers to pulmonary delivery and intracellular delivery of siRNA exists."
3498,"siRNA loaded nanocarriers can be used to overcome the barriers associated with the pulmonary route, such as anatomical barriers, mucociliary clearance, and alveolar macrophage clearance."
3499,"Apart from naked siRNA aerosol delivery, previously studied siRNA carrier systems comprise of lipidic, polymeric, peptide, or inorganic origin."
3500,Such siRNA delivery systems formulated as aerosols can be successfully delivered via an inhaler or nebulizer to the pulmonary region.
3501,Preclinical animal investigations of inhaled siRNA therapeutics rely on intratracheal and intranasal siRNA and siRNA nanocarrier delivery.
3502,"Aerosolized siRNA delivery systems may be characterized using in vitro techniques, such as dissolution test, inertial cascade impaction, delivered dose uniformity assay, laser diffraction, and laser Doppler velocimetry."
3503,The ex vivo techniques used to characterize pulmonary administered formulations include the isolated perfused lung model.
3504,"In vivo techniques like gamma scintigraphy, 3D SPECT, PET, MRI, fluorescence imaging and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analysis may be used for evaluation of aerosolized siRNA delivery systems."
3505,"The use of inhalable siRNA delivery systems encounters barriers to their delivery, however overcoming the barriers while formulating a safe and effective delivery system will offer unique advances to the field of inhaled medicine."
3506,"Previously, we discovered geldanamycin, a ligand of heat shock protein 90, effectively inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 replication in vitro and in vivo (mouse encephalitis model)."
3507,"In this study, we demonstrate that geldanamycin has very strong activities against herpes simplex virus type 2 in vitro and in vivo (mouse vagina model)."
3508,"In mouse vagina model, administration of geldanamycin suspension to vagina after virus infection protected the infected mice from death and increased the average survival days in a dose-dependent manner."
3509,Geldanamycin also significantly reduced virus shedding from mouse vagina.
3510,All geldanamycin-treated groups were statistically significant when compared with the infected control group.
3511,The high-dose group of geldanamycin (5.72 mg kg(−1)) was better than acyclovir group (2.86 mg kg(−1)).
3512,All geldanamycin vaginal administration mock-infected groups did not show significant body weight loss.
3513,"Although geldanamycin has strong antiviral activities against various DNA and RNA viruses, geldanamycin is not suitable for systemic administration because of its high toxicity."
3514,We consider that geldanamycin is a candidate of topical usage for the treatment of herpes simplex virus type infections.
3515,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/ja.2012.67) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
3516,"In making a selection of cellular tools and animal models for generating screening assays in the search for new drugs, one needs to take into consideration the practicality of their use in the drug discovery process."
3517,"Conducting high-throughput primary screens using libraries of small molecules, close to 1 million members in size, requires the generation of large numbers of cells which are easily acquired, reliably enriched, and reproducibly responsive to standard positive controls."
3518,These cells need to be similar in form and function to their counterparts in human disease.
3519,In vitro assays that can be mechanized by using robots can therefore save time and costs.
3520,"In selecting in vivo models, consideration must be given to the species and strain of animal chosen, the appropriateness of the model to human disease, the extent of animal husbandry required during the in-life pharmacological assessment, the technical aspects of generating the model and harvesting the tissues for analyses, the cost of research tools in terms of time and money (demyelinating and remyelinating agents, amount of compound to be generated), and the length of time required for drug testing in the model."
3521,A consideration of the translational aspects of the in vivo model compared to those used in the clinic is also important.
3522,"These themes will be developed with examples for drug discovery in the field of CNS demyelination and repair, specifically as it pertains to multiple sclerosis."
3523,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/npp.2008.145) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
3524,Introduction: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years.
3525,"These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)."
3526,"Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses."
3527,"In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed."
3528,"Expert opinion: Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection."
3529,"Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic."
3530,"Cryptosporidiosis causes life-threatening diarrhea in infants, but the best available treatment is only modestly efficacious."
3531,"Rodents infected with relevant Cryptosporidium species do not develop diarrhea, which complicates drug development."
3532,"Cryptosporidium parvum infection of dairy calves, however, causes an illness like that seen in infants."
3533,"Here, the clinical and microbiologic anti-Cryptosporidium efficacy of the piperazine-based compound MMV665917 was demonstrated in neonatal calves."
3534,Oral administration of MMV665917 (22 mg/kg once daily) was begun two days after the onset of severe diarrhea and continued for seven days.
3535,"Treatment resulted in prompt resolution of diarrhea, and reduced total fecal oocyst shedding by ~94%."
3536,"MMV665917 was useful for treatment, rather than just prophylaxis, since it was safe and effective when administered well after the onset of diarrhea."
3537,"Furthermore, even though all animals received intensive supportive care, there was a strong trend towards improved secondary health outcomes, including general health, appetite, and dehydration measures amongst treated animals."
3538,These data establish MMV665917 as an outstanding lead compound for Cryptosporidium drug development.
3539, The evaluation of the efficacy of an immunochemotherapy protocol to treat symptomatic dogs naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi was studied.
3540,This clinical trial had the purpose to test the combination of N-methyl meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®) and the second generation recombinant vaccine Leish-110f® plus the adjuvant MPL-SE® to treat the canine leishmaniasis (CanL).
3541,Thirty symptomatic naturally infected mongrel dogs were divided into five groups.
3542,Animals received standard treatment with Glucantime® or treatment with Glucantime®/Leish-110f® +MPL-SE® as immunochemotherapy protocol.
3543,"Additional groups received Leish-110f® +MPL-SE® only, MPL-SE® only, or placebo."
3544,"Evaluation of haematological, biochemical (renal and hepatic function) and plasmatic proteins, immunological (humoral and cellular immune response) and the parasitological test revealed improvement of the clinical parameters and parasitological cure in dogs in both chemotherapy alone and immunochemotherapy cohorts."
3545,"However, the immunotherapy and immunochemotherapy cohorts had reduced number of deaths, higher survival probability, and specific cellular reactivity to leishmanial antigens, in comparison with chemotherapy cohort only and control groups (adjuvant alone and placebo)."
3546,These results support the notion of using well-characterized recombinant vaccine as an adjunct to improve the current chemotherapy of CanL.
3547,"Cardiotoxicity is a well-known side effect of doxorubicin (DOX), but the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon are still not completely clear."
3548,"Prediction of drug-induced dysfunction onset is difficult and is still largely based on detection of cardiac troponin (cTn), a circulating marker of heart damage."
3549,"In the last years, several investigations focused on the possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DOX-induced toxicity in vitro, with contrasting results."
3550,"Recently, several groups employed animal models to mimic patient’s condition, investigate the biological pathways perturbed by DOX, and identify diagnostic markers of cardiotoxicity."
3551,We reviewed the results from several studies investigating cardiac miRNAs expression in rodent models of DOX-treatment.
3552,We also discussed the data from two publications indicating the possible use of circulating miRNA as biomarkers of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
3553,"Unfortunately, limited information was derived from these studies, as selection methods of candidate-miRNAs and heterogeneity in cardiotoxicity assessment greatly hampered the novelty and robustness of the findings."
3554,"Nevertheless, at least one circulating miRNA, miR-1, showed a good potential as early biomarker of drug-mediated cardiac dysfunction onset."
3555,The use of animal models to investigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity surely helps narrowing the gap between basic research and clinical practice.
3556,"Despite this, several issues, including selection of relevant miRNAs and less-than-optimal assessment of cardiotoxicity, greatly limited the results obtained so far."
3557,"Nonetheless, the association of patients-based studies with the use of preclinical models may be the key to address the many unanswered questions regarding the pathophysiology and early detection of cardiotoxicity."
3558,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), which is a novel bunyavirus."
3559,"SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China."
3560,"Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam)."
3561,"SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans."
3562,"Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6–30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required."
3563,"Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates."
3564,"While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10(6) copies/mL."
3565,"Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation."
3566,"Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed."
3567,"Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV."
3568,"Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold."
3569,"Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area."
3570,Here we summarize and discuss recent advances in antiviral drugs against SFTSV.
3571,"Rift Valley Fever is a zoonotic, arthropod-borne disease that affects livestock and humans."
3572,"The etiologic agent, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, but can also be transmitted by exposure to infectious aerosols."
3573,There are presently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat severe RVFV infection in humans.
3574,We have previously reported on the activity of favipiravir (T-705) against the MP-12 vaccine strain of RVFV and other bunyaviruses in cell culture.
3575,"In addition, efficacy has also been documented in mouse and hamster models of infection with the related Punta Toro virus."
3576,"Here, we challenged hamsters with the highly pathogenic ZH501 strain of RVFV to evaluate the activity of favipiravir against lethal infection."
3577,Subcutaneous RVFV challenge resulted in substantial serum and tissue viral loads and caused severe disease and mortality within 2–3 days after infection.
3578,Oral favipiravir (200 mg/kg/day) prevented mortality in 60% or greater in hamsters challenged with RVFV when administered within 1 or 6 h post-exposure and reduced RVFV titers in serum and tissues relative to the time of treatment initiation.
3579,"In contrast, although ribavirin (75 mg/kg/day) was effective at protecting animals from the peracute RVFV disease, most ultimately succumbed from a delayed-onset neurologic disease associated with high RVFV burden in the brain observed in moribund animals."
3580,"When combined, T-705 and ribavirin treatment started 24 h post-infection significantly improved survival outcome and reduced serum and tissue virus titers compared to monotherapy."
3581,"Our findings demonstrate significant post-RVFV exposure efficacy with favipiravir against both peracute disease and delayed-onset neuroinvasion, and suggest added benefit when combined with ribavirin."
3582,Significant progress has been achieved for the development of novel anti-viral drugs in the recent years.
3583,"Large numbers of these newly developed drugs belong to three groups of compounds, nucleoside analogues, thymidine kinase-dependent nucleotide analogues and specific viral enzyme inhibitors."
3584,"It has been found that the natural products, like plant extract, plant-derived compounds (phytochemicals) and so on, as well as traditional medicines, like Ayurvedic, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Chakma medicines and so on, are the potential sources for potential and novel anti-viral drugs based on different in vitro and in vivo approaches."
3585,In this chapter some of these important approaches utilised in the drug discovery process of potential candidate(s) for anti-viral agents are being discussed.
3586,The key conclusion is that natural products are one of the most important sources of novel anti-viral agents.
3587,Dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family is a single positive-stranded RNA virus that is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.
3588,The objective of this study was to investigate the use of chloroquine (CLQ) as an antiviral drug against dengue virus in monkeys.
3589,"To analyze the action of the drug in vivo, nonhuman primates groups (Aotus azarai infulatus) were inoculated with a subcutaneous injection of a virulent strain of DENV-2, treated and untreated CLQ."
3590,"Blood hematological, viremia, and serum biochemical values were obtained from 16 DENV-2-inoculated, treated and untreated; four received only CLQ and one mock-infected Aotus monkeys."
3591,"Monkey serum samples (day 0–10 post-inoculation) were assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Cytometric Bead Array for determination of viremia and inflammatory cytokines, respectively."
3592,"Additionally, body temperature and activity levels were determined."
3593,"In the present work, CLQ was effective on replication of DENV-2 in Aotus monkeys; a time viremia reduction was observed compared with the controls."
3594,The concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in the serum of the animals had a statistically significant reduction in the groups treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls.
3595,A significant decrease in systemic levels of the liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also observed in the animals treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls.
3596,These results suggest that CLQ interferes in DENV-2 replication in Aotus monkeys.
3597, Objective To evaluate the scientific basis for the use of Kang 601 heji (K-601) as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent using appropriate animal models.
3598,Methods Carrageenan-induced rat paw and xylene-induced ear oedemas were models used to investigate anti-inflammatory actions of K-601.
3599,Lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia model was used to evaluate antipyretic activity in Wistar rats.
3600,"The anti-inflammatory and antipyretic mechanisms were evaluated by detecting prostaglandins E2, nitric oxide, interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α levels using appropriate reagents and ELISA kits."
3601,Results The results revealed that K-601 reduced the level of inflammations in both anti-inflammatory models in a dose-dependent manner.
3602,The same was true for the antipyretic model.
3603,"The possible mechanisms of actions were through the inhibition of prostaglandins E2, interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide."
3604,Conclusions K-601 has proven anti-inflammatory and antipyretic actions.
3605,The findings provide a scientific basis for the use of K-601 as anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent in traditional Chinese medicinal practice.
3606,"After the recent summary of World Health Organization–authorized research on smallpox, several clinical issues remain."
3607,This policy review addresses whether early hemorrhagic smallpox is disseminated intravascular coagulation and speculates about the cause of the high mortality rate among pregnant women and whether ocular smallpox is partly the result of trachoma or vitamin A deficiency.
3608,"The joint destruction common in children with smallpox might be prevented by antiviral drugs, but intraarticular infusion of antiviral drugs is unprecedented."
3609,Development of highly effective antiviral drugs against smallpox raises the issue of whether postexposure vaccination can be performed without interference by an antiviral drug.
3610,Clinicians should consider whether patients with smallpox should be admitted to general hospitals.
3611,"Although an adequate supply of second-generation smallpox vaccine exists in the United States, its use is unclear."
3612,"Finally, political and ethical forces suggest that destruction of the remaining stocks of live smallpox virus is now appropriate."
3613, Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has a huge potential for the treatment or prevention of various lung diseases.
3614,"Once the RNA molecules have successfully entered the target cells, they could inhibit the expression of specific gene sequence through RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism and generate therapeutic effects."
3615,The biggest obstacle to translating siRNA therapy from the laboratories into the clinics is delivery.
3616,"An ideal delivery agent should protect the siRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape inside the cells, with negligible toxicity."
3617,Lung targeting could be achieved by systemic delivery or pulmonary delivery.
3618,The latter route of administration could potentially enhance siRNA retention in the lungs and reduce systemic toxic effects.
3619,"However the presence of mucus, the mucociliary clearance actions and the high degree branching of the airways present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery."
3620,The delivery systems need to be designed carefully in order to maximize the siRNA deposition to the diseased area of the airways.
3621,"In most of the pulmonary siRNA therapy studies in vivo, siRNA was delivered either intratracheally or intranasally."
3622,Very limited work was done on the formulation of siRNA for inhalation which is believed to be the direction for future development.
3623,This review focuses on the latest development of pulmonary delivery of siRNA for the treatment of various lung diseases.
3624,Background Chloroquine is an inexpensive and widely available 9‐aminoquinolone used in the management of malaria.
3625,"Recently, in vitro assays suggest that chloroquine may have utility in the treatment of several viral infections including influenza."
3626,Objectives We sought to test whether chloroquine is effective against influenza in vivo in relevant animal models.
3627,Methods The effectiveness of chloroquine at preventing or ameliorating influenza following viral challenge was assessed in established mouse and ferret disease models.
3628,"Results Although active against influenza viruses in vitro, chloroquine did not prevent the weight loss associated with influenza virus infection in mice after challenge with viruses expressing an H1 or H3 hemagglutinin protein."
3629,"Similarly, clinical signs and viral replication in the nose of ferrets were not altered by treatment."
3630,"Conclusions Although in vitro results were promising, chloroquine was not effective as preventive therapy in vivo in standard mouse and ferret models of influenza virus infection."
3631,This dampens enthusiasm for the potential utility of the drug for humans with influenza.
3632,"Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of life-threatening diarrhea in young children and causes chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients, but the only approved treatment is ineffective in malnourished children and immunocompromised people."
3633,We here use a drug repositioning strategy and identify a promising anticryptosporidial drug candidate.
3634,Screening a library of benzoxaboroles comprised of analogs to four antiprotozoal chemical scaffolds under pre-clinical development for neglected tropical diseases for Cryptosporidium growth inhibitors identifies the 6-carboxamide benzoxaborole AN7973.
3635,"AN7973 blocks intracellular parasite development, appears to be parasiticidal, and potently inhibits the two Cryptosporidium species most relevant to human health, C. parvum and C. hominis."
3636,"It is efficacious in murine models of both acute and established infection, and in a neonatal dairy calf model of cryptosporidiosis."
3637,"AN7973 also possesses favorable safety, stability, and PK parameters, and therefore, is an exciting drug candidate for treating cryptosporidiosis."
3638,Cystoisosporosis is a leading diarrheal disease in suckling piglets.
3639,"With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health."
3640,"In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth."
3641,"Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369."
3642,"In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively."
3643,"BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (>95%) at 200 nM."
3644,"Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy."
3645,"Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains."
3646,"The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 μM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug."
3647,"Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis."
3648,"For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies."
3649,The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans account for 75 percent of new and emerging infectious diseases.
3650,"Globally, high-consequence pathogens that impact livestock and have the potential for human transmission create research paradoxes and operational challenges for the high-containment laboratories that conduct work with them."
3651,"These specialized facilities are required for conducting all phases of research on high-consequence pathogens (basic, applied, and translational) with an emphasis on both the generation of fundamental knowledge and product development."
3652,"To achieve this research mission, a highly-trained workforce is required and flexible operational methods are needed."
3653,"In addition, working with certain pathogens requires compliance with regulations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent regulations, which adds to the operational burden."
3654,"The vast experience from the existing studies at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, other U.S. laboratories, and those in Europe and Australia with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities designed for large animals, clearly demonstrates the valuable contribution this capability brings to the efforts to detect, prepare, prevent and respond to livestock and potential zoonotic threats."
3655,"To raise awareness of these challenges, which include biosafety and biosecurity issues, we held a workshop at the 2018 American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Biothreats conference to further discuss the topic with invited experts and audience participants."
3656,"The workshop covered the subjects of research funding and metrics, economic sustainment of drug and vaccine development pipelines, workforce turnover, and the challenges of maintaining operational readiness of high containment laboratories."
3657,2019-nCoV in context: lessons learned?
3658,Emerging health problems require rapid advice.
3659,"We describe the development and pilot testing of a systematic, transparent approach used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop rapid advice guidelines in response to requests from member states confronted with uncertainty about the pharmacological management of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection."
3660,"We first searched for systematic reviews of randomized trials of treatment and prevention of seasonal influenza and for non-trial evidence on H5N1 infection, including case reports and animal and in vitro studies."
3661,"A panel of clinical experts, clinicians with experience in treating patients with H5N1, influenza researchers, and methodologists was convened for a two-day meeting."
3662,Panel members reviewed the evidence prior to the meeting and agreed on the process.
3663,"It took one month to put together a team to prepare the evidence profiles (i.e., summaries of the evidence on important clinical and policy questions), and it took the team only five weeks to prepare and revise the evidence profiles and to prepare draft guidelines prior to the panel meeting."
3664,A draft manuscript for publication was prepared within 10 days following the panel meeting.
3665,Strengths of the process include its transparency and the short amount of time used to prepare these WHO guidelines.
3666,The process could be improved by shortening the time required to commission evidence profiles.
3667,"Further development is needed to facilitate stakeholder involvement, and evaluate and ensure the guideline's usefulness."
3668," The ICH S6R1 and S8 guidelines define a general framework for the immunotoxicity evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals and human pharmaceuticals, respectively."
3669,"As severe and unpredicted adverse events dramatically showed in the recent years that the immune system is a critical aspect of drug safety, this framework needs to be revisited to enhance the prediction of nonclinical immune safety evaluation."
3670,Safety immunopharmacology is deemed to contribute to this awaited improvement by enabling early screening of the potential for drug candidates to induce unexpected immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects as well as nonimmune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions.
3671,Dedicated safety immunopharmacology can also generate mechanistic data to determine which relevant additional immunotoxicity studies should be conducted.
3672,Immunological assays and models that can be considered for use in the context of safety pharmacology studies are presented as well as perspectives for their timely development.
3673," Since important agents of viral nosocomial infections like hepatitis B and C viruses and norovirus do not replicate sufficiently in cell culture systems, disinfectants with suspected efficacy against these viruses must be evaluated by different methods."
3674,"Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests."
3675,"Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible."
3676,"In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses."
3677,Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus.
3678,"By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants."
3679,Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection.
3680,"In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection."
3681,Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness to non-specific bronchoconstriction agonists as the primary underlying pathophysiology.
3682,The worldwide incidence of asthma has increased dramatically in the last 40 years.
3683,"According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 300 million children and adults worldwide currently suffer from this incurable disease and 255,000 die from the disease each year."
3684,It is now well accepted that asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome and many clinical subtypes have been described.
3685,Viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been implicated in asthma exacerbation in children because of their ability to cause severe airway inflammation and wheezing.
3686,Infections with atypical bacteria also appear to play a role in the induction and exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults.
3687,"Recent studies confirm the existence of an infectious asthma etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly by other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes."
3688,It is also likely that early-life infections with microbes such as CP could lead to alterations in the lung microbiome that significantly affect asthma risk and treatment outcomes.
3689,These infectious microbes may exacerbate the symptoms of established chronic asthma and may even contribute to the initial development of the clinical onset of the disease.
3690,It is now becoming more widely accepted that patterns of airway inflammation differ based on the trigger responsible for asthma initiation and exacerbation.
3691,"Therefore, a better understanding of asthma subtypes is now being explored more aggressively, not only to decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms but also to select treatment and guide prognoses."
3692,"This review will explore infection-mediated asthma with special emphasis on the protean manifestations of CP lung infection, clinical characteristics of infection-mediated asthma, mechanisms involved and antibiotic treatment outcomes."
3693,: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease to infants and young children worldwide.
3694,"HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death."
3695,Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection.
3696,"However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear."
3697,This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.
3698,"METHODS: In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited."
3699,The data was analyzed by time-series fashion.
3700,Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA.
3701,"We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi)."
3702,RESULTS: The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls.
3703,"Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases."
3704,"Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice."
3705,"Histopathological alterations were observed in the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs of EV71-infected mice."
3706,CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that activation of the RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD.
3707,Cynomolgus macaques are common across South East Asian countries including Thailand.
3708,"The National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU) captures wild-borne cynomolgus macaque for research use."
3709,Limited information is available on the enteric viruses and possible zoonotic infections into or from cynomolgus macaques.
3710,We characterized and compare the fecal virome of two populations; healthy wild-originated captive cynomolgus macaques (n = 43) reared in NPRCT-CU and healthy wild cynomolgus macaques (n = 35).
3711,Over 90% of recognized viral sequence reads amplified from feces were from bacterial viruses.
3712,"Viruses from seven families of mammalian viruses were also detected (Parvoviridae, Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Caliciviridae)."
3713,"The genomes of a member of a new picornavirus genus we named Mafapivirus, a primate chapparvovirus, and a circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA virus were also characterized."
3714,Higher abundance of CRESS DNA viruses of unknown tropism and invertebrate-tropic ambidensovirus were detected in wild versus captive macaques likely reflecting dietary differences.
3715,Short term rearing in captivity did not have a pronounced effect on the diversity of mammalian viruses of wild cynomolgus macaques.
3716,"This study is the first report of the fecal virome of cynomolgus macaques, non-human primates frequently used in biomedical research and vaccination studies."
3717,Japanese encephalitis (JE) is neuroinflammation characterized by uncontrolled infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS).
3718,We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c(hi) dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice.
3719,"Moreover, CD11c(hi) DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE."
3720,"Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro- and anti-inflammation during JE progression."
3721,"The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells, and CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) and Ly-6C(lo) monocytes."
3722,"CD11c(hi) DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells."
3723,This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and RORγT in CD4(+) T cells from the brains of CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice.
3724,"In addition, CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, whereas CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice."
3725,"Furthermore, CD11c(hi) DC ablation altered the phenotype and function of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes, resulting in lower levels of activation marker and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β) expression."
3726,"Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c(hi) DC ablation caused an imbalance in CD4(+) Th17/Treg cells and CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi)/Ly-6C(lo) monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression."
3727,This imbalanced orchestration of pro- and anti-inflammatory leukocytes following CD11c(hi) DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE.
3728," A blinded, randomized, controlled, multi-centric field study was conducted on French dairy farms (n =9) to evaluate the long term efficacy of metaphylactic, single oral treatments with either 1mg/kg body weight (BW) of diclazuril (Vecoxan®), or 15mg/kg BW of toltrazuril (Baycox®) against natural infections with Eimeria zuernii and/or Eimeria bovis, compared to untreated control animals."
3729,A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old at the start of study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups.
3730,"Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight)."
3731,"The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study."
3732,"During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (≥2) was similar (0.7 days) between treated groups."
3733,Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment.
3734,"In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment."
3735,"Thereafter, particularly towards the end of the study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group."
3736,"In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p =0.01) higher (+0.057kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4.4kg higher than the toltrazuril group."
3737,"On eight of the nine trial sites, the average daily gain was greater in the diclazuril group than in the toltrazuril group."
3738,"This study demonstrates that, over an extended observation period of 78 days, metaphylactic treatment with both diclazuril and toltrazuril reduces the impact of coccidiosis, but greater performance benefits based on average daily weight gains, were achieved following the use of diclazuril."
3739,Adrenocortical hormones were first prepared from the adrenal gland as a new compound by Kendall in 1935 [1].
3740,"Thirteen years later, Hench et al."
3741,"[2] observed a miraculous effect of cortisone in a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis, which opened new doors to innovative treatments for a variety of inflammatory diseases."
3742,"Against this background, Kendall, Hench, and Reichstein were awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine."
3743,"Since then, glucocorticoids have been used as a first-line therapy for immune-mediated conditions or as an adjunctive therapy in many inflammatory, infectious, or malignant diseases."
3744,The population of hepatitis B combined with a number of metabolic disorders is increasing significantly.
3745,Resveratrol (RSV) has been used as a preclinical drug for the treatment of the metabolic disorders.
3746,"However, the impact of RSV on HBV replication remains unknown."
3747,"In this study, the HBV-expressing hepatocelluar carcinoma cell line and mouse model created by hydrodynamic injection of viral DNA were used."
3748,"We found that RSV activates Sirt1, which in turn deacetylates PGC-1α and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of PPARα, leading to the enhanced HBV transcription and replication in vitro and in vivo."
3749,"In addition, we found that this pathway is also required for fasting-induced HBV transcription."
3750,"Taken together, this study identifies that RSV enhances HBV transcription and replication especially acting on the core promoter, which depends on Sirt1-PGC-1α-PPARα pathway."
3751,We conclude that RSV may exacerbate the progression of hepatitis B and that patients with hepatitis B infection should be cautious taking RSV as a dietary supplement.
3752,: The inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is primarily driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components [lipoteichoic acid (LTA)].
3753,An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with β-lactam antibiotics.
3754,OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.
3755,"METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and β-lactam compared with treatment with β-lactam antibiotics only."
3756,"The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22)."
3757,RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia.
3758,"LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups."
3759,"CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses."
3760,"Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients."
3761,"In addition, LTA plasma concentration could be too low to mount a response via Toll-like receptor 2 in vitro, but may nonetheless have an effect in vivo."
3762, The quality and safety of commercial vaccines have a profound importance.
3763,Contrary to all precautions and efforts the use of biological material in vaccine development and production may lead to potential contamination of the vaccines with known and unknown extraneous agents (EAs).
3764,"In veterinary field official lists of EAs have been compiled as legal framework to describe the potential agents, which must be tested during manufacture of vaccines."
3765,"Nevertheless, detection of known and unknown contaminants in vaccines is a common duty for manufacturers and authorities of both veterinary and human field sharing similar needs of special technical approaches."
3766,State-of-art molecular methods such as randomly primed PCR combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS) or microarrays may open new perspectives in extraneous agent testing.
3767,"The robustness and efficacy of this technical approach in vaccine control was clearly demonstrated on a human vaccine example when porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) contamination was revealed in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine."
3768,The consequences and implications are reviewed hereby from a veterinary regulatory point of view.
3769,"Glycyrrhizin or, more correctly, Glycyrrhizinic acid is a triterpenoid saponin obtained from the root and rhizome extracts of Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), being commonly used as a sweetener, being reported as – at least – 30 times sweeter than sucrose."
3770,"This natural product, along with its aglycone glycyrrhetinic acid, is known in the literature for its several pharmacological and biological activities."
3771,This chapter summarizes the activities reported in the literature for the saponin and its aglycone since 2010.
3772,Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged zoonotic Paramyxovirus that causes regular outbreaks in East Asia with mortality rate exceeding 75%.
3773,Major cellular targets of NiV infection are endothelial cells and neurons.
3774,"To better understand virus-host interaction, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of NiV infection in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells."
3775,We further assessed some of the obtained results by in vitro and in vivo methods in a hamster model and in brain samples from NiV-infected patients.
3776,We found that NiV infection strongly induces genes involved in interferon response in endothelial cells.
3777,"Among the top ten upregulated genes, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein 10, IP-10), an important chemoattractant involved in the generation of inflammatory immune response and neurotoxicity."
3778,"In NiV-infected hamsters, which develop pathology similar to what is seen in humans, expression of CXCL10 mRNA was induced in different organs with kinetics that followed NiV replication."
3779,"Finally, we showed intense staining for CXCL10 in the brain of patients who succumbed to lethal NiV infection during the outbreak in Malaysia, confirming induction of this chemokine in fatal human infections."
3780,"This study sheds new light on NiV pathogenesis, indicating the role of CXCL10 during the course of infection and suggests that this chemokine may serve as a potential new marker for lethal NiV encephalitis."
3781,Chapter 6 Conveyance and Transportation Issues
3782,"Lassa virus (LASV) is a highly prevalent mammarenavirus in West Africa and is maintained in nature in a persistently infected rodent host, Mastomys natalensis, which is widely spread in sub-Saharan Africa."
3783,"LASV infection of humans can cause Lassa fever (LF), a disease associated with high morbidity and significant mortality."
3784,Recent evidence indicates an LASV expansion outside its traditional endemic areas.
3785,"In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) included LASV in top-priority pathogens and released a Target Product Profile (TPP) for vaccine development."
3786,"Likewise, in 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration added LF to a priority review voucher program to encourage the development of preventive and therapeutics measures."
3787,"In this article, we review recent progress in LASV vaccine research and development with a focus on the impact of LASV genetic and biological diversity on the design and development of vaccine candidates meeting the WHO’s TPP for an LASV vaccine."
3788,  This chapter describes the agency requirements and guidelines for drug development of adenoviral-containing products.
3789,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assessment of safety and ultimately effectiveness of adenovirus containing products involves thorough evaluation of the information contained in the Investigational New Drug Application (IND), and any supporting information cross-referenced to another IND or drug master file."
3790,Many factors contribute to development of FDA recommendations and requirements for characterization of adenovirus vectors.
3791,The FDA receives input and feedback from a variety of sources in formulating recommendations regarding adenovirus manufacturing and characterization.
3792,The recommendations may change with advances in technology and through accumulating experience.
3793,FDA considers the potential risks and benefits of each vector product and each proposed clinical trial when making its recommendations.
3794,"The FDA is cognizant of the need for flexibility in its recommendations and will consider many factors, including the intended target population, the seriousness of the disease under study, the potential benefits and risks from the investigational product, when advising sponsors about their adenovirus development program."
3795,"Nipah virus and Hendra virus are emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic paramyxoviruses that belong to the genus Henipavirus."
3796,They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species.
3797,"Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host."
3798,"We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host."
3799,"Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus."
3800,Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection.
3801,Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay.
3802,"Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses."
3803,"Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro."
3804,"Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters."
3805,"Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections."
3806, Indigenous preparations(IPs) for a male child is reported from some parts of India.
3807,The present study aims to explore the effects of IPs for sex selection or sex selection drugs (SSDs) on pregnancy outcomes in rat models.
3808,"SSDs contain Bryonia laciniosa, Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients."
3809,Methods An experimental design with successfully mated female rats were randomized into control and treatment groups.
3810,Phase 1 had 2 interventional arms while phase 2 had 3 interventional arms (12 rats/arm) besides control arm.
3811,"In phase-1, pregnant females were dosed two SSDs(1000 mg/kg) on gestation days 1–5 whereas, in phase-2, on gestation days 6–19 to correlate the effect of the SSDs (500/1000/1500 mg/kg) consumption during different stages of pregnancy."
3812,Pregnant females were observed for clinical signs following treatment.
3813,The rats were sacrificed one day before expected day of delivery for evaluation.
3814,"Pregnancy rate, gestation index, number of corpora lutea, and litter size were assessed."
3815,"Foetuses were examined for sex, skeletal and soft tissue alterations."
3816,"Discussion and conclusion In phase 1, no appreciable findings were there with SSD exposure."
3817,"In phase 2, intrauterine growth and survival of foetuses were affected when SSDs were administered during organogenesis period."
3818,"Decreased number of live foetuses and increased incidence of early and late resorption, reduced fetal growth with significant alteration in skeleton and viscera were found in treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner."
3819,This correlates well with findings from observational studies in pregnant women.
3820,"However, such treatment at any dose did not effect sex differentiation."
3821,"  This chapter illustrates the recommendations and guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) concerning water, sanitation, and health."
3822,The recommendations and guidelines are evaluated in the light of disease caused by human pathogenic viruses.
3823,The guidelines outline a preventive management framework for safe drinking water.
3824,The framework includes health-based targets to assist national authorities who are normally responsible to set the targets for the protection of public health from risks by exposure to drinking water.
3825,"Assessing the adequacy of systems, defining and monitoring control measures, and establishing management plans are the three components of the so-called water safety plans."
3826,Achievement of health-based targets may be verified by independent surveillance to assess the safety of the drinking water through additional verification or audit-based approaches.
3827,"This framework for safe drinking water can be adapted according to environmental, social, economic, and cultural circumstances of drinking water provision on the national, regional, and local level."
3828,"The chapter concludes that viruses could be considered as biocolloids with specific properties such as size, shape, structure, charge, composition, and genome."
3829,"These viral characteristics determine their behavior in the environment, resistance to natural inactivation and treatment, and disinfection processes."
3830,For each (re-)emerging virus these properties may be known or could be assessed predicting the effectiveness of possible intervention measures for prevention of waterborne disease.
3831,Seasonal influenza viruses are typically restricted to the human upper respiratory tract whereas influenza viruses with greater pathogenic potential often also target extra-pulmonary organs.
3832,"Infants, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers are highly susceptible to severe respiratory disease following influenza virus infection but the mechanisms of disease severity in the mother-infant dyad are poorly understood."
3833,Here we investigated 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection and transmission in breastfeeding mothers and infants utilizing our developed infant-mother ferret influenza model.
3834,Infants acquired severe disease and mortality following infection.
3835,Transmission of the virus from infants to mother ferrets led to infection in the lungs and mother mortality.
3836,Live virus was also found in mammary gland tissue and expressed milk of the mothers which eventually led to milk cessation.
3837,Histopathology showed destruction of acini glandular architecture with the absence of milk.
3838,The virus was localized in mammary epithelial cells of positive glands.
3839,"To understand the molecular mechanisms of mammary gland infection, we performed global transcript analysis which showed downregulation of milk production genes such as Prolactin and increased breast involution pathways indicated by a STAT5 to STAT3 signaling shift."
3840,"Genes associated with cancer development were also significantly increased including JUN, FOS and M2 macrophage markers."
3841,"Immune responses within the mammary gland were characterized by decreased lymphocyte-associated genes CD3e, IL2Ra, CD4 with IL1β upregulation."
3842,Direct inoculation of H1N1 into the mammary gland led to infant respiratory infection and infant mortality suggesting the influenza virus was able to replicate in mammary tissue and transmission is possible through breastfeeding.
3843,In vitro infection studies with human breast cells showed susceptibility to H1N1 virus infection.
3844,"Together, we have shown that the host-pathogen interactions of influenza virus infection in the mother-infant dyad initiate immunological and oncogenic signaling cascades within the mammary gland."
3845,These findings suggest the mammary gland may have a greater role in infection and immunity than previously thought.
3846,"We have previously shown that a non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-binding monoclonal antibody, termed as 2H6, can significantly reduce influenza A virus (IAV) replication when expressed intracellularly."
3847,"In this study, we further showed that 2H6 binds stronger to the NS1 of H5N1 than A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) because of an amino acid difference at residue 48."
3848,A crystal structure of 2H6 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has also been solved and docked onto the NS1 structure to reveal the contacts between specific residues at the interface of antibody-antigen complex.
3849,"In one of the models, the predicted molecular contacts between residues in NS1 and 2H6-Fab correlate well with biochemical results."
3850,"Taken together, residues N48 and T49 in H5N1 NS1 act cooperatively to maintain a strong interaction with mAb 2H6 by forming hydrogen bonds with residues found in the heavy chain of the antibody."
3851,"Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1-2009 and the majority of seasonal H3N2 circulating in humans since 1968 has N48 in NS1, suggesting that mAb 2H6 could bind to most of the currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains."
3852,"Consistent with the involvement of residue T49, which is well-conserved, in RNA binding, mAb 2H6 was also found to inhibit the interaction between NS1 and double-stranded RNA."
3853,Acute viral infection causes damages to the host due to uncontrolled viral replication but even replication deficient viral vectors can induce systemic inflammatory responses.
3854,"Indeed, overactive host innate immune responses to viral vectors have led to devastating consequences."
3855,Macrophages are important innate immune cells that recognize viruses and induce inflammatory responses at the early stage of infection.
3856,"However, tissue resident macrophages are not easily activated by the mere presence of virus suggesting that their activation requires additional signals from other cells in the tissue in order to trigger inflammatory responses."
3857,"Previously, we have shown that the cross-talk between epithelial cells and macrophages generates synergistic inflammatory responses during adenoviral vector infection."
3858,"Here, we investigated whether ATP is involved in the activation of macrophages to induce inflammatory responses during an acute adenoviral infection."
3859,Using a macrophage-epithelial cell co-culture system we demonstrated that ATP signaling through P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R) is required for induction of inflammatory mediators.
3860,We also showed that ATP-P2X(7)R signaling regulates inflammasome activation as inhibition or deficiency of P2X(7)R as well as caspase-1 significantly reduced IL-1β secretion.
3861,"Furthermore, we found that intranasal administration of replication deficient adenoviral vectors in mice caused a high mortality in wild-type mice with symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome but the mice deficient in P2X(7)R or caspase-1 showed increased survival."
3862,"In addition, wild-type mice treated with apyrase or inhibitors of P2X(7)R or caspase-1 showed higher rates of survival."
3863,The improved survival in the P2X(7)R deficient mice correlated with diminished levels of IL-1β and IL-6 and reduced neutrophil infiltration in the early phase of infection.
3864,"These results indicate that ATP, released during viral infection, is an important inflammatory regulator that activates the inflammasome pathway and regulates inflammatory responses."
3865,Diarrheal disease is responsible for 8.6% of global child mortality.
3866,Recent epidemiological studies found the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium to be a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea with particularly grave impact on infants and immunocompromised individuals.
3867,There is neither a vaccine nor effective treatment.
3868,We establish a drug discovery process built on scalable phenotypic assays and mouse models that takes advantage of transgenic parasites.
3869,Screening a library of compounds with anti-parasitic activity we identified pyrazolopyridines as inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis.
3870,Oral treatment with the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 results in potent reduction in intestinal infection of immunocompromised mice.
3871,"Treatment also leads to rapid resolution of diarrhea and dehydration in neonatal calves, a clinical model of cryptosporidiosis that closely resembles human infection."
3872,Our results suggest the Cryptosporidium lipid kinase PI(4)K as a target for pyrazolopyridines and warrant further preclinical evaluation of KDU731 as a drug candidate for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.
3873,"Respiratory viruses infections caused by influenza viruses, human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronaviruses are an eminent threat for public health."
3874,"Currently, there are no licensed vaccines available for hPIV, RSV and coronaviruses, and the available seasonal influenza vaccines have considerable limitations."
3875,"With regard to pandemic preparedness, it is important that procedures are in place to respond rapidly and produce tailor made vaccines against these respiratory viruses on short notice."
3876,"Moreover, especially for influenza there is great need for the development of a universal vaccine that induces broad protective immunity against influenza viruses of various subtypes."
3877,Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) is a replication-deficient viral vector that holds great promise as a vaccine platform.
3878,MVA can encode one or more foreign antigens and thus functions as a multivalent vaccine.
3879,"The vector can be used at biosafety level 1, has intrinsic adjuvant capacities and induces humoral and cellular immune responses."
3880,"However, there are some practical and regulatory issues that need to be addressed in order to develop MVA-based vaccines on short notice at the verge of a pandemic."
3881,"In this review, we discuss promising novel influenza virus vaccine targets and the use of MVA for vaccine development against various respiratory viruses."
3882,This review evaluates the applicability and relative contribution of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) to disinfection of air in health care facilities.
3883,A section addressing the use of UVGI for environmental surfaces is also included.
3884,"The germicidal susceptibility of biologic agents is addressed, but with emphasis on application in health care facilities."
3885,"The balance of scientific evidence indicates that UVGI should be considered as a disinfection application in a health care setting only in conjunction with other well-established elements, such as appropriate heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems; dynamic removal of contaminants from the air; and preventive maintenance in combination with through cleaning of the care environment."
3886,"We conclude that although UVGI is microbiocidal, it is not “ready for prime time” as a primary intervention to kill or inactivate infectious microorganisms; rather, it should be considered an adjunct."
3887,"Other factors, such as careful design of the built environment, installation and effective operation of the HVAC system, and a high level of attention to traditional cleaning and disinfection, must be assessed before a health care facility can decide to rely solely on UVGI to meet indoor air quality requirements for health care facilities."
3888,"More targeted and multiparameter studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and incremental benefit of UVGI for mitigating reservoirs of microorganisms and ultimately preventing cross-transmission of pathogens that lead to health care-associated infections."
3889,Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that participate in the innate immunity of hosts.
3890,"Humans constitutively and/or inducibly express α- and β-defensins, which are known for their antiviral and antibacterial activities."
3891,This review describes the application of human defensins.
3892,"We discuss the extant experimental results, limited though they are, to consider the potential applicability of human defensins as antiviral agents."
3893,"Given their antiviral effects, we propose that basic research be conducted on human defensins that focuses on RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and dengue virus (DENV), which are considered serious human pathogens but have posed huge challenges for vaccine development for different reasons."
3894,"Concerning the prophylactic and therapeutic applications of defensins, we then discuss the applicability of human defensins as antivirals that has been demonstrated in reports using animal models."
3895,"Finally, we discuss the potential adjuvant-like activity of human defensins and propose an exploration of the ‘defensin vaccine’ concept to prime the body with a controlled supply of human defensins."
3896,"In sum, we suggest a conceptual framework to achieve the practical application of human defensins to combat viral infections."
3897,This paper situates the public debate over the use of living animal organs and tissue for human therapies within the history of experimental islet transplantation.
3898,"Specifically, the paper compares and contrasts the Canadian and Australian responses on xenotransplantation to consider what lessons can be learnt about the regulation of a complex and controversial biotechnology."
3899,"Sobbrio and Jorqui described public engagement on xenotransplantation in these countries as ‘important forms of experimental democracy.’ While Canada experimented with a novel nation-wide public consultation, Australia sought public input within the context of a national inquiry."
3900,"In both instances, the outcome was a temporary moratorium on all forms of clinical xenotransplantation comparable to the policies adopted in some European countries."
3901,"In addition, the Australian xenotransplantation ban coincided with a temporary global ban on experimental islet allotransplantation in 2007."
3902,"Through historical and comparative research, this paper investigates how public controversies over organ and tissue transplantation can inform our understanding of the mediation of interspeciality and the regulation of a highly contested technoscience."
3903,"It offers an alternative perspective on the xenotransplantation controversy by exploring the ways in which coinciding moratoriums on islet allograft and xenograft challenge, complicate and confound our assumptions regarding the relationships between human and animal, between routine surgery and clinical experimentation, between biomedical science and social science, and between disease risks and material contagion."
3904,"Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) is a chronic, progressive wasting disease of the kidneys, endemic in certain rural regions of the Balkan nations Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania."
3905,"It is irreversible, and ultimately fatal."
3906,"Though this disease was first described in the 1920s, its causes have been a mystery and a source of much academic and clinical contention."
3907,"Possible etiologic agents that have been explored include exposure to metals and metalloids, viruses and bacteria, and the environmental toxins aristolochic acid (AA) and ochratoxin A (OTA)."
3908,"Aristolochic acid is a toxin produced by weeds of the genus Aristolochia, common in Balkan wheat fields."
3909,Aristolochia seeds may intermingle with harvested grains and thus inadvertently enter human diets.
3910,"Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin (fungal toxin) common in many foods, including cereal grains."
3911,"In this study, we analyzed the weight of evidence for each of the suspected causes of BEN using the Bradford Hill Criteria (BHC): nine conditions that determine weight of evidence for a causal relationship between an agent and a disease."
3912,"Each agent postulated to cause BEN was evaluated using the nine criteria, and for each criterion was given a rating based on the strength of the association between exposure to the substance and BEN."
3913,"From the overall available scientific evidence for each of these suspected risk factors, aristolochic acid is the agent with the greatest weight of evidence in causing BEN."
3914,"We describe other methods for testing causality from epidemiological studies, which support this conclusion of AA causing BEN."
3915, Glioblastoma is a kind of malignant tumour and originates from the central nervous system.
3916,"In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired."
3917,"Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors."
3918,"Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth."
3919,"As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity."
3920,"AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli."
3921,"As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds."
3922,"Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer."
3923,"Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats."
3924,The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma.
3925,AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6.
3926,"Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above."
3927,It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2.
3928,"The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-ĸB, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats."
3929,"In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats."
3930,Vaccination has proven to be the most cost-effective strategy for controlling a wide variety of infectious diseases in humans and animals.
3931,"For the last decade, veterinary vaccines have been substantially developed and demonstrated their effectiveness against many diseases."
3932,"Nevertheless, new vaccines are greatly demanded to effectively control newly- and re-emerging pathogens in livestock."
3933,"However, development of veterinary vaccines is a challenging task, in part, due to a variety of pathogens, hosts, and the uniqueness of host-susceptibility to each pathogen."
3934,"Therefore, novel concepts of vaccines should be explored to overcome the limitation of conventional vaccines."
3935,"There have been greatly advanced in the completion of genomic sequencing of pathogens, the application of comparative genomic and transcriptome analysis."
3936,"This would facilitate to open opportunities up to investigate a new generation of vaccines; recombinant subunit vaccine, virus-like particle, DNA vaccine, and vector-vehicle vaccine."
3937,"Currently, such types of vaccines are being actively explored against various livestock diseases, affording numerous advantages over conventional vaccines, including ease of production, immunogenicity, safety, and multivalency in a single shot."
3938,"In this articles, the authors present the current status of the development of veterinary vaccines at large as well as research activities conducted in Korea."
3939,"In February 2014, health officials from around the world announced the Global Health Security Agenda, a critical effort to strengthen national and global systems to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats and to foster stronger collaboration across borders."
3940,"With its increasing global roles and broad range of regulatory responsibilities in ensuring the availability, safety, and security of medical and food products, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is engaged in a range of efforts in support of global health security."
3941,"This article provides an overview of FDA's global health security roles, focusing on its responsibilities related to the development and use of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for preventing, detecting, and responding to global infectious disease and other public health emergency threats."
3942,"The article also discusses several areas—antimicrobial resistance, food safety, and supply chain integrity—in which FDA's global health security roles continue to evolve and extend beyond MCMs and, in some cases, beyond traditional infectious disease threats."
3943,"73 Regulation and testing of vaccines ‡ ‡ All material in this chapter is in the public domain, with the exception of any borrowed figures or tables."
3944,Individual patients with life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases can petition the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through their physicians to have expanded access (EA) to drugs that are in clinical trials but have not reached full FDA approval (the “single-patient” investigational new drug [IND] application).
3945,"Additionally, recent state and federal laws—so-called “right to try legislation”—allow patients to approach drug companies directly for access prior to FDA approval."
3946,"While these pathways provide potential access for individual patients to investigational drugs, different EA pathways permit entire groups of certain patients to access investigational drugs prior to FDA approval."
3947,"This review focuses on special categories of EA INDs intended for multiple patients—the intermediate-group IND and the widespread-treatment IND—as well as emergency authorization for use of investigational drugs and biological products (e.g., vaccines) in public health emergencies."
3948,Safeguarding against Ebola: Vaccines and therapeutics to be stockpiled for future outbreaks
3949,The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas has caused global concern that we may be on the brink of a healthcare crisis.
3950,The lack of research on ZIKV in the over 60 years that we have known about it has left us with little in the way of starting points for drug discovery.
3951,Our response can build on previous efforts with virus outbreaks and lean heavily on work done on other flaviviruses such as dengue virus.
3952,"We provide some suggestions of what might be possible and propose an open drug discovery effort that mobilizes global science efforts and provides leadership, which thus far has been lacking."
3953,We also provide a listing of potential resources and molecules that could be prioritized for testing as in vitro assays for ZIKV are developed.
3954,"We propose also that in order to incentivize drug discovery, a neglected disease priority review voucher should be available to those who successfully develop an FDA approved treatment."
3955,"Learning from the response to the ZIKV, the approaches to drug discovery used and the success and failures will be critical for future infectious disease outbreaks."
3956,"Introduction: Novel immune globulin (IG) products (RI-002, RI-001) have been designed to provide protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mediated respiratory illness while at the same time meeting the manufacturing requirements established by FDA for antibody supplementation in immunocompromised subjects."
3957,"Areas covered: This review covers the manufacture and development of both RI-001 and RI-002, including the selection of plasma donors for IG preparation with high-titers of anti-RSV antibody, in vitro, and preclinical data in the cotton rat model S. hispidus, and clinical trials including Phase II and compassionate use studies of RI-001 and a multi-center, pivotal Phase III study of RI-002 in PIDD patients."
3958,Expert commentary: The data demonstrate that RI-002 is efficacious in the prevention and treatment of RSV in preclinical normal and immune suppressed animal models and is safe and efficacious in the treatment of patients with various forms of primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD).
3959,This product offers potential advantages over other available IG’s for prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients requiring polyclonal immunoglobulin supplementation because of its unique antibody composition.
3960,"In addition to its enhanced neutralizing anti-RSV activity and its polyclonal IG composition, there is preclinical data to support the use of RI-002 for humoral protection against other respiratory pathogens."
3961, Background The paucity of licensed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the infectious diseases arena strongly contrasts with the ready availability of these therapeutics for use in other conditions.
3962,Aims This narrative review aims to assess the potential of monoclonal antibody-based interventions for infectious diseases.
3963,Sources A review of the literature via the Medline database was performed and complemented by published official documents on licensed anti-infective mAbs.
3964,"In addition, ongoing trials were identified through a search of the clinical trial registration platform ClinicalTrials.gov."
3965,Content We identified the few infections for which mAbs have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium and stressed their potential in representing a readily available protection tool against biothreats and newly emerging and reemerging infectious agents.
3966,"In reviewing the historical context and main features of mAbs, we assert a potentially wider applicability and cite relevant examples of ongoing therapeutic developments."
3967,Factors hindering successful introduction of mAbs on a larger scale are outlined and thoughts are offered on how to possibly address some of these limitations.
3968,Implications mAbs may represent important tools in treating or preventing infections occurring with reasonably sufficient prevalence to justify demand and for which existing alternatives are not deemed fully adequate.
3969,Future initiatives need to address the prohibitive costs encountered in the development process.
3970,The feasibility of more large-scale administration of alternative modalities merits further exploration.
3971,"In order to ensure optimal prospect of regulatory success, an early dialogue with competent authorities is encouraged."
3972,"To reduce the use of antibiotics in animal agriculture, a number of effective or commercially viable alternatives have been implemented by food animal producers or are under development."
3973,"Perhaps the most well‐established strategies are flock and herd management practices to mitigate disease introduction and spread, and, subsequently, reduce the need for antibiotic use."
3974,"While vaccines in food animal production have been used to prevent both bacterial and viral diseases, but historically, most vaccines have targeted viral diseases."
3975,"Though vaccines against viral diseases can help reduce the need for antibiotic use by controlling the spread of secondary bacterial infections, more recent vaccines under development specifically target bacteria."
3976,New developments in selecting and potentially tailoring bacteriophages provide a promising avenue for controlling pathogenic bacteria without the need for traditional small‐molecule antibiotics.
3977,"In this article we discuss these established and emerging strategies, which are anticipated to reduce the reliance on antibiotics in food animal production and should reduce the prevalence and transmission to humans of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from these systems."
3978,Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories help protect populations from biological and chemical public health threats.
3979,We examined the role of LRN biological laboratories in enhancing capacity to detect and respond to public health infectious disease emergencies in South Korea.
3980,"The model for responding to infectious disease emergencies leverages standardized laboratory testing procedures, a repository of standardized testing reagents, laboratory testing cooperation among hospital sentinel laboratories and reference laboratories, and maintenance of a trained workforce through traditional and on-demand training."
3981,Cooperation among all network stakeholders helps ensure that laboratory response is an integrated part of the national response.
3982,"The added laboratory testing capacity provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention LRN assets helps protect persons who reside in South Korea, US military personnel and civilians in South Korea, and those who reside in the continental United States."
3983,Vaccines based on virus-like particles have proved their success in human health.
3984,"More than 25 years after the approval of the first vaccine based on this technology, the substantial efforts to expand the range of applications and target diseases are beginning to bear fruit."
3985,"The incursion of high-throughput screening technologies, combined with new developments in protein engineering and chemical coupling, have accelerated the development of systems capable of producing macrostructures useful for vaccinology, gene delivery, immunotherapy and bionanotechnology."
3986,This review summarizes the most recent developments in microbial cell factories and cell-free systems for virus-like particle production and discusses the future impact of this technology in human and animal health.
3987," Objectives: The aims of this article were: to summarize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy ofdaptomycin; to explore its safety profile; and to discuss its current and potential roles as an antimicrobial therapy."
3988,"Methods: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical s (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics."
3989,s of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed.
3990,Results: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections.
3991,Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis.
3992,"Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro."
3993,"In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%)."
3994,"In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours."
3995,No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
3996,The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed.
3997,"The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea."
3998,Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity.
3999,Conclusions: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials.
4000,"However, limited data are currently available for duration of treatment beyond 14 days and at doses >4 mg/kg QD."
4001,14 EXPRESSION OF RECOMBINANT PROTEINS IN THE MILK OF TRANSGENIC ANIMALS
4002,Zika virus (ZIKV) remained largely quiescent for nearly six decades after its first appearance in 1947.
4003,"ZIKV reappeared after 2007, resulting in a declaration of an international “public health emergency” in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
4004,"Until this time, ZIKV was considered to induce only mild illness, but it has now been established as the cause of severe clinical manifestations, including fetal anomalies, neurological problems, and autoimmune disorders."
4005,"Infection during pregnancy can cause congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly and neurological degeneration, and in other cases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, making infections with ZIKV a substantial public health concern."
4006,"Genomic and molecular investigations are underway to investigate ZIKV pathology and its recent enhanced pathogenicity, as well as to design safe and potent vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics."
4007,"This review describes progress in the design and development of various anti-ZIKV therapeutics, including drugs targeting virus entry into cells and the helicase protein, nucleosides, inhibitors of NS3 protein, small molecules, methyltransferase inhibitors, interferons, repurposed drugs, drugs designed with the aid of computers, neutralizing antibodies, convalescent serum, antibodies that limit antibody-dependent enhancement, and herbal medicines."
4008,"Additionally, covalent inhibitors of viral protein expression and anti-Toll-like receptor molecules are discussed."
4009,"To counter ZIKV-associated disease, we need to make rapid progress in developing novel therapies that work effectually to inhibit ZIKV."
4010,"Emergence and re-emergence of respiratory virus infections represent a significant threat to global public health, as they occur seasonally and less frequently (such as in the case of influenza virus) as pandemic infections."
4011,Some of these viruses have been in the human population for centuries and others had recently emerged as a public health problem.
4012,"Influenza viruses have been affecting the human population for a long time now; however, their ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic drift and antigenic shift causes the emergence of new strains."
4013,A recent example of these events is the avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus outbreak currently undergoing in China.
4014,Human H7N9 influenza viruses are resistant to amantadines and some strains are also resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors greatly limiting the options for treatment.
4015,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may cause a lower respiratory tract infection characterized by bronchiolitis and pneumonia mainly in children and the elderly.
4016,"Infection with RSV can cause severe disease and even death, imposing a severe burden for pediatric and geriatric health systems worldwide."
4017,"Treatment for RSV is mainly supportive since the only approved therapy, a monoclonal antibody, is recommended for prophylactic use in high-risk patients."
4018,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging respiratory virus.
4019,The virus was first recognized in 2012 and it is associated with a lower respiratory tract disease that is more severe in patients with comorbidities.
4020,No licensed vaccines or antivirals have been yet approved for the treatment of MERS-CoV in humans.
4021,It is clear that the discovery and development of novel antivirals that can be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to treat these important respiratory viral infections are critical.
4022,"In this review, we will describe some of the novel therapeutics currently under development for the treatment of these infections."
4023,Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene.
4024,Antisense-mediated exon-skipping is a promising therapeutic strategy that makes use of synthetic nucleic acids to skip frame-disrupting exon(s) and allows for short but functional protein expression by restoring the reading frame.
4025,"In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eteplirsen, which skips DMD exon 51 and is applicable to approximately 13% of DMD patients."
4026,"Multiple exon skipping, which is theoretically applicable to 80–90% of DMD patients in total, have been demonstrated in animal models, including dystrophic mice and dogs, using cocktail antisense oligonucleotides (AOs)."
4027,"Although promising, current drug approval systems pose challenges for the use of a cocktail AO."
4028,"For example, both exons 6 and 8 need to be skipped to restore the reading frame in dystrophic dogs."
4029,"Therefore, the cocktail of AOs targeting these exons has a combined therapeutic effect and each AO does not have a therapeutic effect by itself."
4030,"The current drug approval system is not designed to evaluate such circumstances, which are completely different from cocktail drug approaches in other fields."
4031,Significant changes are needed in the drug approval process to promote the cocktail AO approach.
4032,DNA vaccination has been developed in the last two decades in human and animal species as a promising alternative to conventional vaccination.
4033,"It consists in the injection, in the muscle, for example, of plasmid DNA encoding the vaccinating polypeptide."
4034,Electroporation which forces the entrance of the plasmid DNA in cells at the injection point has been described as a powerful and promising strategy to enhance DNA vaccine efficacy.
4035,"Due to the fact that the vaccine is composed of DNA, close attention on the fate of the plasmid DNA upon vaccination has to be taken into account, especially at the injection point."
4036,"To perform such studies, the muscle injection point has to be precisely recovered and collected several weeks after injection."
4037,This is even more difficult for large and growing animals.
4038,A technique has been developed to localize precisely and collect efficiently the muscle injection points in growing piglets 6 weeks after DNA vaccination accompanied or not by electroporation.
4039,"Electroporation did not significantly increase the level of remaining plasmids compared to nonelectroporated piglets, and, in all the cases, the levels were below the limit recommended by the FDA to research integration events of plasmid DNA into the host DNA."
4040,In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators.
4041,"The discovery of these new medicines has been driven primarily by new approaches in inflammatory diseases and oncology, especially in immuno-oncology."
4042,"Other recent successes have included new antibodies for use in viral diseases, including HIV."
4043,The perception of very high costs associated with mAbs has led to the assumption that they play no role in prophylaxis for diseases of poverty.
4044,"However, improvements in antibody-expression yields and manufacturing processes indicate this is a cost-effective option for providing protection from many types of infection that should be revisited."
4045,Recent technology developments also indicate that several months of protection could be achieved with a single dose.
4046,"Moreover, new methods in B cell sorting now enable the systematic identification of high-quality antibodies from humanized mice, or patients."
4047,"This Review discusses the potential for passive immunization against schistosomiasis, fungal infections, dengue, and other neglected diseases."
4048,Emerging viruses pose a major threat to humans and livestock with global public health and economic burdens.
4049,"Vaccination remains an effective tool to reduce this threat, and yet, the conventional cell culture often fails to produce sufficient vaccine dose."
4050,"As an alternative to cell-culture based vaccine, virus-like particles (VLPs) are considered as a highpriority vaccine strategy against emerging viruses."
4051,VLPs represent highly ordered repetitive structures via macromolecular assemblies of viral proteins.
4052,The particulate nature allows efficient uptake into antigen presenting cells stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses towards enhanced vaccine efficacy.
4053,Increasing research activity and translation opportunity necessitate the advances in the design of VLPs and new bioprocessing modalities for efficient and cost-effective production.
4054,"Herein, we describe major achievements and challenges in this endeavor, with respect to designing strategies to harnessing the immunogenic potential, production platforms, downstream processes, and some exemplary cases in developing VLP-based vaccines."
4055,: Environmental virology started with the detection of poliovirus in water.
4056,Since then other enteric viruses responsible for gastroenteritis and hepatitis have replaced enteroviruses as the main target for detection.
4057,"Most shellfish-borne viral outbreaks are restricted to norovirus and hepatitis A virus, making them the main targets for bivalve virological analysis."
4058,"The inclusion of virus analysis in regulatory standards for viruses in molluscan bivalve samples must overcome several shortcomings such as the technical difficulties and high costs of virus monitoring, the lack of harmonised and standardised assays and the challenge posed by the ever-changing nature of viruses."
4059,"Nowadays methods are available to detect, quantify and characterise viral pathogens in molluscan shellfish to reduce the risks of shellfish-borne virus diseases."
4060,"During the past two decades, there have been numerous attempts at using animals in order to produce recombinant human proteins and monoclonal antibodies."
4061,"However, it is only recently that the first two therapeutic agents isolated from the milk of transgenic animals, C1 inhibitor (Ruconest) and antithrombin (ATryn), appeared on the market."
4062,This inspires hope that a considerable number of new recombinant proteins created using such technology could become available for practical use in the near future.
4063,"In this review, the methods applied to produce transgenic animals are described and the advantages and drawbacks related to their use for producing recombinant human proteins and monoclonal antibodies are discussed."
4064,"Newly Recognized Causes of Acute Lung Injury: Transfusion of Blood Products, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Avian Influenza"
4065,Therapeutic Use of Immunoglobulins
4066,Laws are fundamental tools that regulate and manage various issues to protect the rights of the people in a society.
4067,"Legislation on disease surveillance enables agencies to regulate and manage public health, including preventing the spread of infectious diseases."
4068,We assessed the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act of Korea (IDPCA) through the lens of biosurveillance to understand its effectiveness in protecting public health.
4069,"In addition, the relevant legislation and regulations of the United States and the World Health Organization were examined."
4070,The evaluation concludes that the current IDPCA is limited in terms of providing guidance for early detection of and response to hazards using integrated data and an information-sharing system.
4071,Further revision of the laws is needed to enable early detection and warning of potential threats to public health.
4072, Drug discovery and development are long and financially taxing processes.
4073,On an average it takes 12–15 years and costs 1.2 billion USD for successful drug discovery and approval for clinical use.
4074,Many lead molecules are not developed further and their potential is not tapped to the fullest due to lack of resources or time constraints.
4075,"In order for a drug to be approved by FDA for clinical use, it must have excellent therapeutic potential in the desired area of target with minimal toxicities as supported by both pre-clinical and clinical studies."
4076,The targeted clinical evaluations fail to explore other potential therapeutic applications of the candidate drug.
4077,Drug repurposing or repositioning is a fast and relatively cheap alternative to the lengthy and expensive de novo drug discovery and development.
4078,"Drug repositioning utilizes the already available clinical trials data for toxicity and adverse effects, at the same time explores the drug's therapeutic potential for a different disease."
4079,This review addresses recent developments and future scope of drug repositioning strategy.
4080, Emerging viruses are a major threat to human health.
4081,Recent outbreaks have emphasized the urgent need for new antiviral treatments.
4082,"For several pathogenic viruses, considerable efforts have focused on vaccine development."
4083,"However, during epidemics infected individuals need to be treated urgently."
4084,"High-throughput screening of clinically tested compounds provides a rapid means to identify undiscovered, antiviral functions for well-characterized therapeutics."
4085,Repurposed drugs can bypass part of the early cost and time needed for validation and authorization.
4086,In this review we describe recent efforts to find broad spectrum antivirals through drug repurposing.
4087,We have chosen several candidates and propose strategies to understand their mechanism of action and to determine how resistance to antivirals develops in infected cells.
4088,"Ensuring the virological safety of biologicals is challenging due to the risk of viral contamination of raw materials and cell banks, and exposure during in-process handling to known and/or emerging viral pathogens."
4089,Viruses may contaminate raw materials and biologicals intended for human or veterinary use and remain undetected until appropriate testing measures are employed.
4090,The outbreak and expansive spread of the mosquito-borne flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) poses challenges to screening human- and animal -derived products used in the manufacture of biologicals.
4091,"Here, we report the results of an in vitro study where detector cell lines were challenged with African and Asian lineages of ZIKV."
4092,"We demonstrate that this pathogen is robustly detectable by in vitro assay, thereby providing assurance of detection of ZIKV, and in turn underpinning the robustness of in vitro virology assays in safety testing of biologicals."
4093,Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a global public health emergency due to its rapidly expanding range and its ability to cause severe congenital defects such as microcephaly.
4094,"However, there are no FDA-approved therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection."
4095,"Through our screening of viral entry inhibitors, we found that chloroquine (CQ), a commonly used antimalarial and a FDA-approved drug that has also been repurposed against other pathogens, could significantly inhibit ZIKV infection in vitro, by blocking virus internalization."
4096,We also demonstrated that CQ attenuates ZIKV-associated morbidity and mortality in mice.
4097,"Finally, we proved that CQ protects fetal mice from microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection."
4098,Our methodology of focusing on previously identified antivirals in screens for effectiveness against ZIKV proved to be a rapid and efficient means of discovering new ZIKV therapeutics.
4099,"Selecting drugs that were previously FDA-approved, such as CQ, also improves the likelihood that they may more quickly reach stages of clinical testing and use by the public."
4100, We studied the adjuvanticity of recombinant Onchocerca volvulus activation associated protein-1 (rOv-ASP-1) for ovalbumin (OVA) in mice.
4101,"After a single immunization and one boost, rOv-ASP-1 exceeded the efficacy of alum or MPL+TDM adjuvants in terms of end-point total IgG or IgG1 and IgG2a anti-OVA titres."
4102,"Using the helminth-derived adjuvant, IgG isotype responses to OVA were of a mixed Th1/Th2 profile and spleen cell cytokines exclusively Th1-type."
4103,The potent adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 was confirmed in mice vaccinated with a 37-mer peptide from the S protein of SARS-CoV and an HIV-1 gp120-CD4 chimeric polypeptide antigen.
4104,"Unusually for a helminth product, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant augmented not only Th2 but also Th1 responses, the latter property being of potential utility in stimulating anti-viral immune responses."
4105, Cell culture-based production methods may assist in meeting increasing demand for seasonal influenza vaccines and developing production flexibility required for addressing influenza pandemics.
4106,"MDCK-33016PF cells are used in propagation of a cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (Optaflu®); but, like most continuous cell lines, can grow in immunocompromised mice to produce tumors."
4107,"It is, therefore, essential that no residual cells remain within the vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses or oncogenic DNA."
4108,"Multiple, redundant processes ensure the safety of influenza vaccines produced in MDCK-33016PF cells."
4109,The probability of a residual cell being present in a dose of vaccine is approximately 1 in 1034.
4110,Residual MDCK-DNA is ≤10ng per dose and the ß-propiolactone used to inactivate influenza virus results in reduction of detectable DNA to less than 200base pairs (bp).
4111,Degenerate PCR and specific PCR confirm exclusion of oncogenic viruses.
4112,The manufacturing process has been validated for its capacity to remove and inactivate viruses.
4113,"We conclude that the theoretical risks arising from manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine using MDCK-33016PF cells are reduced to levels that are effectively zero by the multiple, orthogonal processes used during production."
4114,The recent pandemic of H1N1 has demonstrated the potential vulnerability of the human population to novel influenza viruses.
4115,"While there is recent increased interest and effort in developing effective anti-influenza agents, few new products have entered clinical studies."
4116,"This review will highlight the limited armamentarium of licensed influenza agents, and discuss novel compounds and strategies that have entered clinical studies and may therefore be imminently available to the treating clinician."
4117,: FTY720 (fingolimod) is the first oral drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with the relapsing-remitting form of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis.
4118,Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS).
4119,We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease.
4120,METHODS: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus.
4121,"Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded."
4122,Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry.
4123,"The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined."
4124,"The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice."
4125,RESULTS: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality.
4126,"These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P < 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05) into the CNS."
4127,Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P < 0.05).
4128,"Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α or cytolytic activity."
4129,FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation.
4130,CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis.
4131,FTY720 treatment reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination by restricting the access of disease-causing lymphocytes into the CNS but is not associated with viral recrudescence in this model.
4132,: The model of epidemiologic transitions has served as a guiding framework for understanding relationships between patterns of human health and disease and economic development for the past several decades.
4133,"However, epidemiologic transition theory is infrequently employed in epidemiology."
4134,"OBJECTIVE: Moving beyond Omran's original formulation, we discuss critiques and modifications of the theory of epidemiologic transitions and highlight some of the ways in which incorporating epidemiologic transition theory can benefit theory and practice in epidemiology."
4135,"DESIGN: We focus on two broad contemporary trends in human health that epidemiologic transition theory is useful for conceptualizing: the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as allergic and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease."
4136,"RESULTS: Situating these trends within epidemiologic transition theory, we explain the rise in CIDs with the hygiene hypothesis and the rise in emerging and reemerging infections with the concept of a third epidemiologic transition."
4137,"CONCLUSIONS: Contextualizing these trends within epidemiologic transition theory reveals implications for clinical practice, global health policies, and future research within epidemiology."
4138,The uses of antiviral agents are increasing in the new era along with the development of vaccines for the effective control of viral diseases.
4139,The main aims of antiviral agents are to minimize harm to the host system and eradicate deadly viral diseases.
4140,"However, the replications of viruses in host system represent a massive therapeutic challenge than bacteria and fungi."
4141,Antiviral drugs not just penetrate to disrupt the virus’ cellular divisions but also have a negative impact on normal physiological pathways in the host.
4142,"Due to these issues, antiviral agents have a narrow therapeutic index than antibacterial drugs."
4143,Nephrotoxicity is the main adverse reaction of antiviral drugs in human and animals.
4144,"In this chapter, we summarize the antiviral agents’ past, present and future perspectives with the main focus on the brief history of antiviral in animals, miscellaneous drugs, natural products, herbal and repurposing drugs."
4145,"More than 40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for a number of disease indications with only one of these (Synagis) — for a viral disease, and not for therapy but for prevention."
4146,"However, in the last decade novel potent mAbs have been discovered and characterized with potential as therapeutics against viruses of major importance for public health and biosecurity including Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah virus (NiV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), West Nile virus (WNV), influenza virus (IFV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)."
4147,"Here, we review such mAbs with an emphasis on antibodies of human origin, and highlight recent results as well as technologies and mechanisms related to their potential as therapeutics."
4148, Viruses are worldwide pathogens with a high impact on the human population.
4149,"Despite the constant efforts to fight viral infections, there is a need to discover and design new drug candidates."
4150,Antiviral peptides are molecules with confirmed activity and constitute excellent alternatives for the treatment of viral infections.
4151,"In the present study, we developed AntiVPP 1.0, an accurate bioinformatic tool that uses the Random Forest algorithm for antiviral peptide predictions."
4152,The model of AntiVPP 1.0 for antiviral peptide predictions uses several features of 1088 peptides for training and validation.
4153,"During the validation of the model we achieved the TPR = 0.87, SPC = 0.97, ACC = 0.93 and MCC = 0.87 performance measures, which were indicative of a robust model."
4154,"AntiVPP 1.0 is a fast, accurate and intuitive software focused on the assessment of antiviral peptides candidates."
4155,AntiVPP 1.0 is available at https://github.com/bio-coding/AntiVPP.
4156,Special Issue “Equine Viruses”: Old “Friends” and New Foes?
4157,Feed has been identified as a vector of transmission for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).
4158,The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination.
4159,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control.
4160,"A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit."
4161,"Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control."
4162,"The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control."
4163,"Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches."
4164,None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate.
4165,This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates.
4166,Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay.
4167,"Sequence 1 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location."
4168,"Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4."
4169,Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms.
4170,Pigs were initially 10-d old.
4171,Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study.
4172,All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study.
4173,One replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi.
4174,One replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi although no detectable PEDV RNA was found in the feed.
4175,The results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA although sequenced feed without detectible PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR can be infectious.
4176,"Therefore, a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed."
4177,"Bioterrorism is the deliberate release of biological toxins, pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites, or other infectious agents into the public sphere with the objective of causing panic, illness, and/or death on a local, regional, or possibly national scale."
4178,The list of potential biological agents compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is long and diverse.
4179,"However, a trait common to virtually all the potential bioterrorism agents is the fact that they are likely to be disseminated by either aerosol or in food/water supplies with the intention of targeting the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts, respectively."
4180,"In some instances, inhalation or ingestion would mimic the natural route by which humans are exposed to these agents."
4181,"In other instances, (e.g., the inhalation of a toxin is normally associated with food borne illness), it would represent an unnatural route of exposure."
4182,"For most potential bioterrorism agents, the respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa may simply serve as a route of entry by which they gain access to the systemic compartment where intoxication/replication occurs."
4183,"For others, however, the respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa is the primary tissue associated with pathogenesis, and therefore, the tissue for which countermeasures must be developed."
4184," Since the first case of human infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, more than 2260 cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection and 803 related deaths have been reported since the 16th of October 2018."
4185,"The vast majority of these cases (71%) were reported in Saudi Arabia but the epidemic has now spread to 27 countries and has not ceased 6 years later, unlike SARS-CoV that disappeared a little less than 2 years after emerging."
4186,"Due to the high fatality rate observed in MERS-CoV infected patients (36%), much effort has been put into understanding the origin and pathophysiology of this novel coronavirus to prevent it from becoming endemic in humans."
4187,"This review focuses in particular on the origin, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of infected patients."
4188,The experience gained over recent years on how to manage the different risks related to this kind of epidemic will be key to being prepared for future outbreaks of communicable disease.
4189,"According to the free drug hypothesis only the unbound drug is available to act at physiological sites of action, and as such the importance of plasma protein binding primarily resides in its impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
4190,"Of the major plasma proteins, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) represents an intriguing one primarily due to the high affinity, low capacity properties of this protein."
4191,"In addition, there are marked species and age differences in protein expression, homology and drug binding affinity."
4192,"As such, a thorough understanding of drug binding to AAG can help aid and improve the translation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from preclinical species to human as well as adults to neonates."
4193,"This review provides a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the biochemistry of AAG; endogenous function, impact of disease, utility as a biomarker, and impact on PK/PD."
4194,Experimental considerations are discussed as well as recommendations for understanding the potential impact of AAG on PK through drug discovery and early development.
4195,We have previously described the use of a double coated agarose-agarose porcine islet macrobead for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus.
4196,"In the current study, the long-term viral safety of macrobead implantation into pancreatectomized diabetic dogs treated with pravastatin (n = 3) was assessed while 2 dogs served as nonimplanted controls."
4197,"A more gradual return to preimplant insulin requirements occurred after a 2nd implant procedure (days 148, 189, and >652) when compared to a first macrobead implantation (days 9, 21, and 21) in all macrobead implanted animals."
4198,"In all three implanted dogs, porcine C-peptide was detected in the blood for at least 10 days following the first implant and for at least 26 days following the second implant."
4199,C-peptide was also present in the peritoneal fluid of all three implanted dogs at 6 months after 2nd implant and in 2 of 3 dogs at necropsy.
4200,Prescreening results of islet macrobeads and culture media prior to transplantation were negative for 13 viruses.
4201,No evidence of PERV or other viral transmission was found throughout the study.
4202,This study demonstrates that the long-term (2.4 years) implantation of agarose-agarose encapsulated porcine islets is a safe procedure in a large animal model of type I diabetes mellitus.
4203," Due to the severity of rare diseases, the societal need for biopharmaceutical treatments for these diseases is high, despite low numbers of patients."
4204,"Therefore, we investigated the barriers currently hindering the willingness to develop orphan drugs in the Netherlands."
4205,"To this end, a robust, small sample, exploratory analysis of Dutch multi-actor development of orphan drugs was performed."
4206,Various factors that were expected to stimulate the adoption of orphan drug development were found to be important barriers.
4207,"Concerted actions of producers, users, and especially regulators are necessary to overcome these barriers, but the prerequisite of a shared problem definition is lacking."
4208,Porcine circovirus (PCV) is one of the smallest known DNA viruses in mammals.
4209,"At present, PCVs are divided into three species, PCV1, PCV2, and PCV3."
4210,"PCV1 and PCV2 were found in the 1970s and the 1990s, respectively, whereas PCV3 was discovered recently in 2016."
4211,PCV1 does not cause diseases in pigs.
4212,"However, PCV3, similar to PCV2, is reported to be associated with several swine diseases, including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure."
4213,PCVs are very common in domestic pigs as well as wild boars.
4214,"However, PCVs have been occasionally isolated from non-porcine animals, including ruminants (such as cattle, goats, wild chamois, and roe deers), rodents (such as NMRI mice, BALB/c mice, Black C57 mice, ICR mice, Mus musculus, and Rattus rattus), canines (such as dogs, minks, foxes, and raccoon dogs), insects (such as flies, mosquitoes, and ticks), and shellfish."
4215,"Moreover, PCVs are frequently reported in biological products, including human vaccines, animal vaccines, porcine-derived commercial pepsin products, and many cell lines."
4216,"PCVs are also abundant in the environment, including water samples and air samples."
4217,"Interestingly, PCV1 and/or PCV2 antibody or antigen has also been detected in sera, stool samples and respiratory swab samples of human, revealing zoonotic potential of PCVs."
4218,"Thus, PCVs inhabit many types of reservoirs."
4219,"In this review, we summarize the reservoirs of PCVs, and this information would be helpful in understanding the natural circulating status and possible cross-species transmission of PCVs."
4220,ABSTRACT The primary objective of this randomized controlled challenge study was to investigate the effect of ampicillin on ultrasonographic (US) lung consolidation after experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida in preweaned dairy calves.
4221,"The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME)."
4222,"Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (±SD) age of 52 ± 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 1010 cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida."
4223,"Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14."
4224,"Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m."
4225,"once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m."
4226,once daily for 3 d] when ≥1 cm2 of lung consolidation was observed and ≥6 h had elapsed since challenge.
4227,Lung lesions ≥1 cm2 were considered positive for consolidation.
4228,Calves were respiratory score positive if ≥2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart.
4229,"Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively."
4230,Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME.
4231,"At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score."
4232,"The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17)."
4233,"On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease."
4234,"On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves."
4235,Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves.
4236,"Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived."
4237,Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection.
4238,Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.
4239,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared eradication of the dreadful disease “smallpox” in 1980.
4240,"Though the disease has died down, the causative virus “variola” has not, as it has been well preserved in two high security laboratories—one in USA and another in Russia."
4241,"The debate on whether the remaining stocks of the smallpox virus should be destroyed or not is ongoing, and the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2011 has decided to postpone the review on this debate to the 67th WHA in 2014."
4242,A short questionnaire-based inquiry was organized during a one-day stem cell meeting to explore the views of various health care and life science specialists especially students on this aspect.
4243,"Among the 200 participants of the meeting, only 66 had answered the questionnaire."
4244,"60.6% of participants who responded to the questionnaire were for preserving the virus for future reference, while 36.4% of the participants were for destroying the virus considering the magnitude with which it killed millions."
4245,"However, 3% of the respondents were not able to decide on any verdict."
4246,"Therefore, this inquiry expresses the view that “what we cannot create, we do not have the right to destroy.”"
4247," Molecular farming of pharmaceuticals in plants has the potential to provide almost unlimited amounts of recombinant proteins for use in disease diagnosis, prevention or treatment."
4248,Tobacco has been and will continue to be a major crop for molecular farming and offers several practical advantages over other crops.
4249,"It produces significant leaf biomass, has high soluble protein content and is a non-food crop, minimizing the risk of food-chain contamination."
4250,"This, combined with its flexibility and highly-efficient genetic transformation/regeneration, has made tobacco particularly well suited for plant-based production of biopharmaceutical products."
4251,The goal of this review is to provide an update on the use of tobacco for molecular farming of biopharmaceuticals as well the technologies developed to enhance protein production/purification/efficacy.
4252,We show that tobacco is a robust biological reactor with a multitude of applications and may hold the key to success in plant molecular farming.
4253,"In vitro, nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to have antimicrobial activity against a wide range of viruses, including influenza A virus."
4254,"Therefore, we hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) would increase survival in vivo by reducing the viral load in C57Bl/6 mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1; WSN/33) virus."
4255,"NO was delivered to influenza-infected mice either continuously or intermittently at 80 or 160 ppm, respectively, using both prophylactic and post-infection treatment strategies."
4256,"Murine survival and weight loss were assessed, and lung viral load was quantified via plaque assay."
4257,"Here, we report that iNO administered prophylactically or post-influenza infection failed to improve survival of infected mice."
4258,No difference in lung viral load was observed between experimental groups.
4259,"Although NO has antiviral activity against influenza A virus in vitro, iNO therapy provided no apparent benefit when used for treatment of influenza A virus infection in vivo."
4260, RNA viruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in humans every year.
4261,"Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security."
4262,"Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed."
4263,"Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials."
4264,Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides.
4265,"Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation."
4266,"Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the catalytic degradation of complementary mRNAs."
4267,"As RNA virus infection is predicated on the delivery, replication, and translation of viral RNA, these pathogens present an obvious target for the rapidly advancing field of sequence-specific therapeutics."
4268,Antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs can be designed to target the viral RNA genome or viral transcripts.
4269,This article reviews current knowledge on therapeutic applications of antisense and RNA interference for highly pathogenic RNA viral infections.
4270," The 27th International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) was held in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA from May 12 to 16, 2014."
4271,This article summarizes the principal invited lectures.
4272,John Drach (Elion Award) described the early days of antiviral drugs and their novel modes of action.
4273,Piet Herdewijn (Holý Award) used evolutionary pressure to select DNA polymerases that accept nucleoside analogs.
4274,Replacing thymine by 5-chlorouracil led to the generation of a new form of Escherichia coli.
4275,Adrian Ray (Prusoff Award) demonstrated how prodrugs can markedly improve both the efficacy and safety of potential drugs.
4276,"The keynote addresses, by David Margolis and Myron Cohen, tackled two emerging areas of HIV research, to find an HIV “cure” and to prevent HIV transmission, respectively."
4277,These topics were discussed further in other presentations – a cure seems to be a distant prospect but there are exciting developments for reducing HIV transmission.
4278,"TDF-containing vaginal rings and GSK-744, as a long-lasting injection, offer great hope."
4279,There were three mini-symposia.
4280,"Although therapy with TDF/FTC gives excellent control of HBV replication, there are only a few patients who achieve a functional cure."
4281,"Myrcludex, an entry inhibitor, is active against both HBV and HDV."
4282,The recent progress with HBV replication in cell cultures has transformed the search for new antiviral compounds.
4283,The HBV capsid protein has been recognized as key player in HBV DNA synthesis.
4284,"Unexpectedly, compounds which enhance capsid formation, markedly reduce HBV DNA synthesis."
4285,"The development of BCX4430, which is active against Marburg and Ebola viruses, is of great current interest."
4286,Antisense therapy is a powerful tool for inducing post-transcriptional modifications and thereby regulating target genes associated with disease.
4287,"There are several classes of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) with therapeutic use, such as double-stranded RNAs (interfering RNAs, utilized for gene silencing, and single-stranded AONs with various chemistries, which are useful for antisense targeting of micro-RNAs and mRNAs."
4288,"In particular, the use of AONs for exon skipping, by targeting pre-mRNA, is proving to be a highly promising therapy for some genetic disorders like Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy."
4289,"However, AONs are unable to cross the plasma membrane unaided, and several other obstacles still remain to be overcome, in particular their instability due to their nuclease sensitivity and their lack of tissue specificity."
4290,"Various drug delivery systems have been explored to improve the bioavailability of nucleic acids, and nanoparticles (NPs) have been suggested as potential vectors for DNA/RNA."
4291,"This review describes the recent progress in AON conjugation with natural and synthetic delivery systems, and provides an overview of the efficacy of NP-AON complexes as an exon-skipping treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
4292,Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have long provided powerful research tools for virologists to understand the mechanisms of virus entry into host cells and of antiviral immunity.
4293,"Even so, commercial development of human (or humanized) mAbs for the prophylaxis, preemptive and acute treatment of viral infections has been slow."
4294,"This is surprising, as new antibody discovery tools have increased the speed and precision with which potent neutralizing human antiviral mAbs can be identified."
4295,"As longstanding barriers to antiviral mAb development, such as antigenic variability of circulating viral strains and the ability of viruses to undergo neutralization escape, are being overcome, deeper insight into the mechanisms of mAb action and engineering of effector functions are also improving the efficacy of antiviral mAbs."
4296,"These successes, in both industrial and academic laboratories, coupled with ongoing changes in the biomedical and regulatory environments, herald an era when the commercial development of human antiviral mAb therapies will likely surge."
4297,"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being utilised as a nonhuman primate model for human disease, ranging from autoimmune to infectious disease."
4298,"In order to fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the human host response is necessary."
4299,"Commercially available reagents, primarily targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals."
4300,"Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined."
4301,"Generally, the phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25% B-cells, and 12% NK cells."
4302,The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were more similar to human values than mouse values.
4303,"Comparison of the activation status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection exhibited different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types active in the innate immune response."
4304,This work significantly enhances the ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their use as models of infectious disease.
4305,"Risk is an inherent component of human existence, as is our creation of ways to avoid or minimize such risks."
4306,"The formal process of assessing the likelihood and magnitude of risk, using that information to manage risk, and then communicating the process to others, forms the basis for risk analysis."
4307,"This chapter provides an overview of the steps of risk analysis with a focus on risk assessment for foodborne viruses, particularly quantitative efforts that model and estimate the risks these viruses pose to human health."
4308,"Most risk assessments in food and environmental virology performed in the last decade have focused on water, fresh produce, molluscan shellfish, and prepared foods."
4309,"Recent examples of enteric virus risk modeling efforts are discussed in detail, as are several of the difficulties and intricacies of performing risk assessments for foodborne viruses compared to bacteria and other agents."
4310,"This is a relatively new area of study, but one that will continue to grow as national and international agencies continue to adopt and require the methodology for food safety and the protection of human health."
4311,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatality rate of over 39%, and poses a considerable threat to public health."
4312,A lack of approved vaccine or drugs currently constitutes a roadblock in controlling disease outbreak and spread.
4313,"In this study, we generated MERS-CoV VLPs using the baculovirus expression system."
4314,Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy results demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs are structurally similar to the native virus.
4315,"Rhesus macaques inoculated with MERS-CoV VLPs and Alum adjuvant induced virus-neutralizing antibodies titers up to 1:40 and induced specific IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD), with endpoint titers reaching 1:1,280."
4316,"MERS-CoV VLPs also elicited T-helper 1 cell (Th1)-mediated immunity, as measured by ELISpot."
4317,"These data demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs have excellent immunogenicity in rhesus macaques, and represent a promising vaccine candidate."
4318,RNA interference (RNAi) as a mechanism to selectively degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) expression has emerged as a potential novel approach for drug target validation and the study of functional genomics.
4319,Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) therapeutics has developed rapidly and already there are clinical trials ongoing or planned.
4320,"Although other challenges remain, delivery strategies for siRNA become the main hurdle that must be resolved prior to the full-scale clinical development of siRNA therapeutics."
4321,"This article provides an overview of the current delivery strategies for synthetic siRNA, focusing on the targeted, self-assembled nanoparticles which show potential to become a useful and efficient tool in cancer therapy."
4322,": Rapid transmission of norovirus often occurs due to its low infectious dosage, high genetic diversity and its short incubation time."
4323,The viruses cause acute gastroenteritis and may lead to death.
4324,"Presently, no effective vaccine or selective drugs accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for the treatment of norovirus."
4325,"Advances in the development of norovirus replicon cell lines, GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain human B cells, and murine and gnotobiotic pig norovirus models have facilitated the discovery of effective small molecule inhibitors in vitro and in vivo."
4326,AREAS COVERED: This review gives a brief discussion of the biology and replication of norovirus before highlighting the discovery of anti-norovirus molecules.
4327,"The article coverage includes: an overview of the current state of norovirus drug discovery, the targeting of the norovirus life cycle, the inhibition of structural and nonstructural proteins of norovirus such as proteases and polymerase, and the blockage of virus entry into host cells."
4328,"Finally, anti-norovirus drugs in the clinical development stage are described."
4329,"EXPERT OPINION: The current approach for the counteraction of norovirus focuses on the inhibition of viral RNA polymerase, norovirus 3C-like protease and the structural proteins VP1 as well as the blockade of norovirus entry."
4330,"Broad-spectrum anti-norovirus molecules, based on the inhibition of 3C-like protease, have been developed."
4331,Other host factors and ways to overcome the development of resistance through mutation are also being examined.
4332,A dual approach in targeting viral and host factors may lead to an effective counteraction of norovirus infection.
4333,"Current successes in developing norovirus replicon harboring cells and norovirus infected human cells, as well as murine norovirus models and other animal models such as piglets have facilitated the discovery of effective drugs and helped our understanding of its mechanism of action."
4334,AIM: To investigate the antiviral effects of vectors expressing specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in vitro and in vivo.
4335,"METHODS: Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively."
4336,The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice.
4337,"RESULTS: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay."
4338,"Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 μg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners."
4339,Transfection with either plasmid (2 μg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi.
4340,"In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 μg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys."
4341,CONCLUSION: Plasmid-based shRNAs potently inhibit HTNV replication in vitro and in vivo.
4342,Our results provide a basis for development of shRNA as therapeutics for HTNV infections in humans.
4343,"The classic development of vaccines is lengthy, tedious, and may not necessarily be successful as demonstrated by the case of HIV."
4344,This is especially a problem for emerging pathogens that are newly introduced into the human population and carry the inherent risk of pandemic spread in a naïve population.
4345,"For such situations, a considerable number of different platform technologies are under development."
4346,"These are also under development for pathogens, where directly derived vaccines are regarded as too complicated or even dangerous due to the induction of inefficient or unwanted immune responses causing considerable side-effects as for dengue virus."
4347,"Among platform technologies are plasmid-based DNA vaccines, RNA replicons, single-round infectious vector particles, or replicating vaccine-based vectors encoding (a) critical antigen(s) of the target pathogens."
4348,"Among the latter, recombinant measles viruses derived from vaccine strains have been tested."
4349,Measles vaccines are among the most effective and safest life-attenuated vaccines known.
4350,"Therefore, the development of Schwarz-, Moraten-, or AIK-C-strain derived recombinant vaccines against a wide range of mostly viral, but also bacterial pathogens was quite straightforward."
4351,"These vaccines generally induce powerful humoral and cellular immune responses in appropriate animal models, i.e., transgenic mice or non-human primates."
4352,"Also in the recent first clinical phase I trial, the results have been quite encouraging."
4353,"The trial indicated the expected safety and efficacy also in human patients, interestingly independent from the level of prevalent anti-measles immunity before the trial."
4354,"Thereby, recombinant measles vaccines expressing additional antigens are a promising platform for future vaccines."
4355,Memory and learning declines are consequences of normal aging.
4356,"Since those functions are associated with the hippocampus, I analyzed the global gene expression data from post-mortem hippocampal tissue of 25 old (age ≥ 60 yrs) and 15 young (age ≤ 45 yrs) cognitively intact human subjects."
4357,"By employing a rigorous, multi-method bioinformatic approach, I identified 36 genes that were the most significant in terms of differential expression; and by employing mathematical modeling, I demonstrated that 7 of the 36 genes were able to discriminate between the old and young subjects with high accuracy."
4358,"Remarkably, 90% of the known genes from those 36 most significant genes are associated with either inflammation or immune system activation."
4359,"This suggests that chronic inflammation and immune system over-activity may underlie the aging process of the human brain, and that potential anti-inflammatory treatments targeting those genes may slow down this process and alleviate its symptoms."
4360,A variety of plant species have been genetically modified to accumulate vaccine antigens for human and animal health and the first vaccine candidates are approaching the market.
4361,"The regulatory burden for animal vaccines is less than that for human use and this has attracted the attention of researchers and companies, and investment in plant-made vaccines for animal infectious disease control is increasing."
4362,"The dosage cost of vaccines for animal infectious diseases must be kept to a minimum, especially for non-lethal diseases that diminish animal welfare and growth, so efficient and economic production, storage and delivery are critical for commercialization."
4363,It has become clear that transgenic plants are an economic and efficient alternative to fermentation for large-scale production of vaccine antigens.
4364,The oral delivery of plant-made vaccines is particularly attractive since the expensive purification step can be avoided further reducing the cost per dose.
4365,This review covers the current status of plant-produced vaccines for the prevention of disease in animals and focuses on barriers to the development of such products and methods to overcome them.
4366, Objective To evaluate the health effects of parental dietary exposure to GM rice TT51 on the male reproductive system of rat offspring.
4367,"Methods Rice-based diets, containing 60% ordinary grocery rice, MingHui63, or TT51 by weight, were given to parental rats (15 males/30 females each group) for 70 days prior mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation."
4368,"After weaning, eight male offspring rats were randomly selected at each group and fed with diets correspondent to their parents’ for 70 days."
4369,"The effects of exposure to TT51 on male reproductive system of offspring rats were assessed through sperm parameters, testicular function enzyme activities, serum hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone levels), testis histopathological examination, and the relative expression levels of selected genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary- testicular (HPT) axis."
4370,"Results No significant differences were observed in body weight, food intake, organ/body weights, serum hormone, sperm parameters, testis function enzyme ACP, LDH, and SDH activities, testis histopathological changes, and relative mRNA expression levels of GnRH-R, FSH-R, LH-R, and AR along the HPT axis."
4371,Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate that parental dietary exposure to TT51 reveals no significant differences on the reproductive system of male offspring rats compared with MingHui63 and control.
4372,Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a cause of hepatitis in humans worldwide and has been associated with a mortality rate of up to 30% in pregnant women.
4373,"Recently, persistent and chronic HEV infections have been recognized as a serious clinical problem, especially in immunocompromised individuals."
4374,"To date, there are no FDA-approved HEV-specific antiviral drugs."
4375,"In this study, we evaluated antisense peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) designed against HEV genomic sequences as potential HEV-specific antiviral compounds."
4376,"Two genetically-distinct strains of human HEV, genotype 1 Sar55 and genotype 3 Kernow-C1, isolated from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis, respectively, were used to evaluate inhibition of viral replication by PPMO in liver cells."
4377,"The anti-HEV PPMO produced a significant reduction in the levels of HEV RNA and capsid protein, indicating effective inhibition of HEV replication."
4378,"PPMO HP1, which targets a highly conserved sequence in the start site region of ORF1, was also effective against the genotype 3 Kernow-C1 strain in stably-infected HepG2/C3A liver cells."
4379,"The antiviral activity observed was specific, dose-responsive and potent, suggesting that further exploration of PPMO HP1 as a potential HEV-specific antiviral agent is warranted."
4380,Recently newer synthetic DNA vaccines have been rapidly advanced to clinical study and have demonstrated an impressive degree of immune potency and tolerability.
4381,"Improvements in DNA delivery over prior needle and syringe approaches include jet delivery, gene gun delivery, among others."
4382,"Among the most effective of these new delivery methods, advanced electroporation (EP), combined with other advances, induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in both preventative as well as therapeutic studies."
4383,"Advancements in the design of the DNA inserts include leader sequence changes, RNA and codon optimizations, improved insert designs, increased concentrations of DNA, and skin delivery, appear to complement newer delivery strategies."
4384,These advances also provide a framework for the in vivo production of synthetic DNA biologics.
4385,"In this review, we focus on recent studies of synthetic DNA vaccines in the clinic for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases with a focus on adaptive electroporation for delivery, and briefly summarize novel preclinical data advancing the in vivo delivery of DNA-encoded antibody-like biologics."
4386,": Nipah virus (NiV), a zoonotic pathogen causing severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans, emerged in Malaysia in 1998 with subsequent outbreaks on an almost annual basis since 2001 in parts of the Indian subcontinent."
4387,"The high case fatality rate, human-to-human transmission, wide-ranging reservoir distribution and lack of licensed intervention options are making NiV a serious regional and potential global public health problem."
4388,"The objective of this study was to develop a fast-acting, single-dose NiV vaccine that could be implemented in a ring vaccination approach during outbreaks."
4389,"METHODS: In this study we have designed new live-attenuated vaccine vectors based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing NiV glycoproteins (G or F) or nucleoprotein (N) and evaluated their protective efficacy in Syrian hamsters, an established NiV animal disease model."
4390,We further characterized the humoral immune response to vaccination in hamsters using ELISA and neutralization assays and performed serum transfer studies.
4391,RESULTS: Vaccination of Syrian hamsters with a single dose of the rVSV vaccine vectors resulted in strong humoral immune responses with neutralizing activities found only in those animals vaccinated with rVSV expressing NiV G or F proteins.
4392,"Vaccinated animals with neutralizing antibody responses were completely protected from lethal NiV disease, whereas animals vaccinated with rVSV expressing NiV N showed only partial protection."
4393,"Protection of NiV G or F vaccinated animals was conferred by antibodies, most likely the neutralizing fraction, as demonstrated by serum transfer studies."
4394,Protection of N-vaccinated hamsters was not antibody-dependent indicating a role of adaptive cellular responses for protection.
4395,CONCLUSIONS: The rVSV vectors expressing Nipah virus G or F are prime candidates for new ‘emergency vaccines’ to be utilized for NiV outbreak management.
4396, The recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak poses a serious threat to public health.
4397,"Here, we summarize recent advances in identifying human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MERS-CoV, describe their mechanisms of action, and analyze their potential for treatment of MERS-CoV infections."
4398,"Today, small molecule antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of infections with herpesviruses, HIV, HBV and HCV as well as with influenza viruses."
4399,"Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum (but aspecific) antiviral, has been approved for the treatment of infections with respiratory syncytial virus, HCV and Lassa virus."
4400,"Yet, for many other viruses that cause life-threatening infections [most of which are considered emerging and/or neglected] there are no drugs available."
4401,"Ideally, potent and broad-spectrum (i.e., pan-genus or pan-family virus activity) antiviral drugs should be developed whereby one drug could be used for the treatment of a number of such viral infections."
4402,We here review recent evolutions in the search for inhibitors of emerging and neglected RNA viruses.
4403,: Xylometazoline hydrochloride (HCl) is a nasal decongestant that causes vasoconstriction in the nasal submucosa.
4404,It has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis/sinusitis.
4405,"Iota-carrageenan is effective against a broad variety of respiratory viruses, which are the most common cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract."
4406,"Therefore, it is used as the active component in the antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic (1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan in 0.5% NaCl) and other medical device nasal sprays that are approved and marketed in the EU."
4407,"Recently, we developed a nasal spray formulation containing both xylometazoline HCl (0.05%) and iota-carrageenan (0.12%) that provides decongestion and antiviral protection of the nasal mucosa at the same time."
4408,"RESULTS: A set of in vitro experiments revealed that the vasoconstrictive properties of xylometazoline HCl and the antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan against human rhinovirus (hRV) 1a, hRV8 and human coronavirus OC43 were maintained in the formulation containing these two compounds."
4409,Permeation experiments using bovine nasal mucosa showed that iota-carrageenan had no significant influence on the permeation of xylometazoline HCl.
4410,"Finally, in the local tolerance and toxicity study, it was shown that the formulation was well tolerated at the application site with no occurrence of erythema or edema in the nostrils of all rabbits or any signs of toxicity in any of the organs and tissues inspected."
4411,"CONCLUSION: Investigations on compatibility of xylometazoline HCl and iota-carrageenan demonstrated that the substances do not influence each other, allowing both to fulfill their known specific clinical efficacy (xylometazoline HCl) and effectiveness (iota-carrageenan)."
4412,"To achieve therapeutic success, transfer vehicles for gene therapy must be capable of transducing target cells while avoiding impact on non-target cells."
4413,"Despite the high transduction efficiency of viral vectors, their tropism frequently does not match the therapeutic need."
4414,"In the past, this lack of appropriate targeting allowed only partial exploitation of the great potential of gene therapy."
4415,Substantial progress in modifying viral vectors using diverse techniques now allows targeting to many cell types in vitro.
4416,"Although important challenges remain for in vivo applications, the first clinical trials with targeted vectors have already begun to take place."
4417,"Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland coordinate and facilitate preclinical research on infectious diseases to develop medical countermeasures for high consequence pathogens."
4418,This facility is unique in that it is the only maximum containment laboratory in the world where conventional and molecular medical imaging equipment are incorporated into the design of the facility.
4419,"This capability provides investigators with unique tools to dissect disease pathogenesis, evaluate the ability of animal models to recapitulate human disease, and test candidate countermeasures."
4420,"Importantly, advanced molecular imaging has the potential to provide alternative endpoints to lethality."
4421,"By using these alternative endpoints, investigators can reduce the number of animals used in experiments and evaluate countermeasures in sublethal models."
4422,"With the incorporation of medical imaging modalities, a clinical laboratory modeled after those existing in hospitals, and a highly trained veterinary medicine team, IRF Frederick is uniquely suited to advance our understanding of emerging infectious diseases and to facilitate the development of medical countermeasures and clinical care paradigms previously considered impossible."
4423,"After Edward Jenner established human vaccination over 200 years ago, attenuated poxviruses became key players to contain the deadliest virus of its own family: Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox."
4424,"Cowpox virus (CPXV) and horsepox virus (HSPV) were extensively used to this end, passaged in cattle and humans until the appearance of vaccinia virus (VACV), which was used in the final campaigns aimed to eradicate the disease, an endeavor that was accomplished by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980."
4425,"Ever since, naturally evolved strains used for vaccination were introduced into research laboratories where VACV and other poxviruses with improved safety profiles were generated."
4426,"Recombinant DNA technology along with the DNA genome features of this virus family allowed the generation of vaccines against heterologous diseases, and the specific insertion and deletion of poxvirus genes generated an even broader spectrum of modified viruses with new properties that increase their immunogenicity and safety profile as vaccine vectors."
4427,"In this review, we highlight the evolution of poxvirus vaccines, from first generation to the current status, pointing out how different vaccines have emerged and approaches that are being followed up in the development of more rational vaccines against a wide range of diseases."
4428,Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a heterogenous group of lung disease in critically ill patients that continues to have high mortality.
4429,"Despite the increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ARDS, specific targeted treatments for ARDS have yet to be developed."
4430,ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies.
4431,"Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients."
4432,"Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs."
4433,"Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of agents, allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs and resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity."
4434,"Although attractive, delivering nanomedicine to lungs can be challenging as it requires sophisticated systems."
4435,Here we review the potential of novel nanomedicine approaches that may prove to be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of this devastating condition.
4436," The pharmacological inhibitor SP600125 [anthra(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone] has been largely employed as a c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) inhibitor."
4437,"In this study, we evaluated whether pretreatment with SP600125 was able to prevent Orthopoxviruses Vaccinia virus (VACV), Cowpox virus (CPXV) and modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) replication."
4438,"We found that incubation with SP600125 not only blocked virus-stimulated JNK phosphorylation, but also, significantly reduced virus production."
4439,"We observed 1–3 log decline in viral yield depending on the cell line infected (A31, BSC-40 or BHK-21)."
4440,"The reduction in viral yield correlated with a dramatic impact on virus morphogenesis progress, intracellular mature viruses (IMV) were barely detected."
4441,"Despite the fact that SP600125 can act as an efficient anti-orthopoxviral compound, we also provide evidence that this antiviral effect is not specifically exerted through JNK1/2 inhibition."
4442,This conclusion is supported by the fact that viral titers measured after infections of JNK1/2 knockout cells were not altered as compared to those of wild-type cells.
4443,"In contrast, a decline in viral titers was verified when the infection of KO cells was carried out in the presence of the pharmacological inhibitor."
4444,SP600125 has been the focus of recent studies that have evaluated its action on diverse viral infections including DNA viruses.
4445,Our data support the notion that SP600125 can be regarded as a potential antipoxviral compound.
4446,"The clinical application of HIV fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide (T20), was limited mainly because of its short half-life."
4447,"Here we designed and synthesized two PEGylated C34 peptides, PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34, with the PEG chain length of 2 and 5 kDa, respectively, and evaluated their anti-HIV-1 activity and mechanisms of action."
4448,We found that these two PEGylated peptides could bind to the HIV-1 peptide N36 to form high affinity complexes with high α-helicity.
4449,The peptides PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 effectively inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell–cell fusion with an effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC(50)) of about 36 nM.
4450,"They also inhibited infection of the laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain NL4-3 with EC(50) of about 4–5 nM, and against 47 HIV-1 clinical isolates circulating in China with mean EC(50) of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 of about 26 nM and 32 nM, respectively."
4451,"The plasma half-life (t(1/2)) of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 was 2.6 h and 5.1 h, respectively, and the t(1/2) of PEGylated C34 was about 2.4-fold and 4.6-fold longer than C34 (~1.1 h), respectively."
4452,These findings suggest that PEGylated C34 with broad-spectrum anti-HIV-1 activity and prolonged half-life can be further developed as a peptide fusion inhibitor-based long-acting anti-HIV drug for clinical use to treat HIV-infected patients who have failed to respond to current anti-retrovirus drugs.
4453, Medicinal plants have been widely used to treat a variety of infectious and non-infectious ailments.
4454,"According to one estimate, 25% of the commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants."
4455,"Several plants could offer a rich reserve for drug discovery of infectious diseases, particularly in an era when the latest separation techniques are available on one hand, and the human population is challenged by a number of emerging infectious diseases on the other hand."
4456,"Among several other ailments, viral infections, particularly infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and 2 (HIV-2), and newly emerging infectious viruses have challenged mankind survival."
4457,"Of importance, a variety of medicinal plants have shown promise to treat a number of viral infections, and some of them possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity."
4458,"In the past, exploration into the antiviral activity of various promising medicinal plants was limited due to: (a) highly infectious nature of viruses and (b) lack of appropriate separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components from plants."
4459,"Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus could be used for antiviral screening purposes, and advancement in separation technologies offers promise for medicinal plants usage in modern drug discovery."
4460,"This article describes potential antiviral properties of medicinal plants against a diverse group of viruses, and suggests screening the potential of plants possessing broad-spectrum antiviral effects against emerging viral infections."
4461,Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are one of the major causes of common cold in humans and are also associated with acute asthma and bronchial illness.
4462,"Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, is an important host factor for the replication of single-strand RNA viruses."
4463,"In the current study, we examined the effect of the Hsp90 inhibitor pochonin D, in vitro and in vivo, using a murine model of human rhinovirus type 1B (HRV1B) infection."
4464,Our data suggested that Hsp90 inhibition significantly reduced the inflammatory cytokine production and lung damage caused by HRV1B infection.
4465,The viral titer was significantly lowered in HRV1B-infected lungs and in Hela cells upon treatment with pochonin D. Infiltration of innate immune cells including granulocytes and monocytes was also reduced in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by pochonin D treatment after HRV1B infection.
4466,Histological analysis of the lung and respiratory tract showed that pochonin D protected the mice from HRV1B infection.
4467,"Collectively, our results suggest that the Hsp90 inhibitor, pochonin D, could be an attractive antiviral therapeutic for treating HRV infection."
4468, The target for a terrorist attack with a viral agent can range from humans to animals and plants.
4469,"However, the use of a viral agent may pose a challenge due to problems associated with acquisition, cultivation, and dissemination."
4470,Agricultural targets are of concern as they would require relatively little specialized expertise and technology and can have large economic consequences.
4471,"Viral agents are prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory."
4472,"Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable with antimicrobials, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections."
4473,"Ninety years after the discovery of the virus causing the influenza disease, this malady remains one of the biggest public health threats to mankind."
4474,Currently available drugs and vaccines only partially reduce deaths and hospitalizations.
4475,"Some of the reasons for this disturbing situation stem from the sophistication of the viral machinery, but another reason is the lack of a complete understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of viral infections and host–pathogen interactions."
4476,"Even the functions of the influenza proteins, their mechanisms of action and interaction with host proteins have not been fully revealed."
4477,"These questions have traditionally been studied in mammalian animal models, mainly ferrets and mice (as well as pigs and non-human primates) and in cell lines."
4478,"Although obviously relevant as models to humans, these experimental systems are very complex and are not conveniently accessible to various genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches."
4479,"The fact that influenza remains an unsolved problem, in combination with the limitations of the conventional experimental models, motivated increasing attempts to use the power of other models, such as low eukaryotes, including invertebrate, and primary cell cultures."
4480,"In this review, we summarized the efforts to study influenza in yeast, Drosophila, zebrafish and primary human tissue cultures and the major contributions these studies have made toward a better understanding of the disease."
4481,We feel that these models are still under-utilized and we highlight the unique potential each model has for better comprehending virus–host interactions and viral protein function.
4482,: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that infects humans and results in chickenpox and herpes zoster.
4483,"A number of VZV genes remain functionally uncharacterized and since VZV is an obligate human pathogen, rigorous evaluation of VZV mutants in vivo remains challenging."
4484,Simian varicella virus (SVV) is homologous to VZV and SVV infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely mimics VZV infection of humans.
4485,Recently the SVV genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and BAC-derived SVV displayed similar replication kinetics as wild-type (WT) SVV in vitro.
4486,"METHODS: RMs were infected with BAC-derived SVV or WT SVV at 4x10(5) PFU intrabronchially (N=8, 4 per group, sex and age matched)."
4487,"We collected whole blood (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at various days post-infection (dpi) and sensory ganglia during latent infection (>84 dpi) at necropsy and compared disease progression, viral replication, immune response and the establishment of latency."
4488,RESULTS: Viral replication kinetics and magnitude in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and whole blood as well as rash severity and duration were similar in RMs infected with SVV BAC or WT SVV.
4489,"Moreover, SVV-specific B and T cell responses were comparable between BAC and WT-infected animals."
4490,"Lastly, we measured viral DNA in sensory ganglia from both cohorts of infected RMs during latent infection."
4491,CONCLUSIONS: SVV BAC is as pathogenic and immunogenic as WT SVV in vivo.
4492,"Thus, the SVV BAC genetic system combined with the rhesus macaque animal model can further our understanding of viral ORFs important for VZV pathogenesis and the development of second-generation vaccines."
4493, Oligonucleotide-based drugs have received considerable attention for their capacity to modulate gene expression very specifically and as a consequence they have found applications in the treatment of many human acquired or genetic diseases.
4494,"Clinical translation has been often hampered by poor biodistribution, however."
4495,Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) appear as a possibility to increase the cellular delivery of non-permeant biomolecules such as nucleic acids.
4496,"This review focuses on CPP-delivery of several classes of oligonucleotides (ONs), namely antisense oligonucleotides, splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) and siRNAs."
4497,Two main strategies have been used to transport ONs with CPPs: covalent conjugation (which is more appropriate for charge-neutral ON analogues) and non-covalent complexation (which has been used for siRNA delivery essentially).
4498,"Chemical synthesis, mechanisms of cellular internalization and various applications will be reviewed."
4499,A comprehensive coverage of the enormous amount of published data was not possible.
4500,"Instead, emphasis has been put on strategies that have proven to be effective in animal models of important human diseases and on examples taken from the authors' own expertise."
4501,Current human papillomavirus (HPV) major capsid protein L1 virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccines in clinic induce strong HPV type-specific neutralizing antibody responses.
4502,"To develop pan-HPV vaccines, here, we show that the fusion protein E3R4 consisting of three repeats of HPV16 L2 aa 17–36 epitope (E3) and a modified human IgG1 Fc scaffold (R4) induces cross-neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against divergent HPV types."
4503,E3R4 was expressed as a secreted protein in baculovirus expression system and could be simply purified by one step Protein A affinity chromatography with the purity above 90%.
4504,"Vaccination of E3R4 formulated with Freunds adjuvant not only induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV pseudovirus types 16, 18, 45, 52, 58, 6, 11 and 5 in mice, but also protected mice against vaginal challenges with HPV pseudovirus types 16, 45, 52, 58, 11 and 5 for at least eleven months after the first immunization."
4505,"Moreover, vaccination of E3R4 formulated with FDA approved adjuvant alum plus monophosphoryl lipid A also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV types 16, 18 and 6 in rabbits."
4506,"Thus, our results demonstrate that delivery of L2 antigen as a modified Fc-fusion protein may facilitate pan-HPV vaccine development."
4507,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes significant adverse sequelae in the developing fetus, and results in long-term structural and neurologic defects."
4508,"Most preventive and therapeutic efforts have focused on the development of vaccines, antivirals, and antibodies."
4509,"The placental immunologic response to ZIKV, however, has been largely overlooked as a target for therapeutic intervention."
4510,"The placental inflammatory response, specifically IL-1β secretion and signaling, is induced by ZIKV infection and represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk of perinatal developmental abnormalities."
4511,"We show in a mouse model that maternally administrated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA; Kineret, or anakinra), following ZIKV exposure, can preserve placental function (by improving trophoblast invasion and placental vasculature), increase fetal viability, and reduce neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring."
4512,"We further demonstrate that while ZIKV RNA is highly detectable in placentas, it is not correlated with fetal viability."
4513,"Beyond its effects in the placenta, we show that IL-1 blockade may also directly decrease fetal neuroinflammation by mitigating fetal microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner."
4514,"Our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during ZIKV-infected pregnancies, and demonstrate that maternal IRA may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes."
4515,Single chain variable fragments (scFvs) are generated by joining together the variable heavy and light chain of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) via a peptide linker.
4516,"They offer some advantages over the parental mAb such as low molecular weight, heterologous production, multimeric form, and multivalency."
4517,The scFvs were produced against more than 50 antigens till date using 10 different plant species as the expression system.
4518,There were considerable improvements in the expression and purification strategies of scFv in the last 24 years.
4519,"With the growing demand of scFv in therapeutic and diagnostic fields, its biosynthesis needs to be increased."
4520,"The easiness in development, maintenance, and multiplication of transgenic plants make them an attractive expression platform for scFv production."
4521,The review intends to provide comprehensive information about the use of plant expression system to produce scFv.
4522,"The developments, advantages, pitfalls, and possible prospects of improvement for the exploitation of plants in the industrial level are discussed."
4523,"Studies administering plasma protein isolates (PPIs) to experimentally challenged animals have reported improvements in growth, food intake, and overall condition when compared with animals fed control diets, due in part to improvements in gut barrier function, normalization of cytokine signals, and support of enteric immune function."
4524,These and early clinical studies suggest that nutritional therapy with PPIs may similarly assist in restoring homeostasis to gut barrier function in humans experiencing mild or more acute enteropathic symptomatology such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
4525,"This meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins."
4526,"MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords."
4527,Twenty-nine articles retrieved through this process were evaluated; 11 studies including 13 experiments were selected for inclusion in the analysis.
4528,"The meta-analysis included descriptive analyses and methods for combining P values for the primary endpoint, average daily growth (ADG) at week 1, and secondary endpoints including ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) at weeks 1 and 2 and at the end of study."
4529,"Primary and secondary endpoint analyses of growth (ADG, ADFI, and G:F) were significant (P < 0.01)."
4530,"The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α were significantly lower in animals fed dietary PPIs."
4531,Additional research in patients experiencing symptoms of enteropathy will further characterize the benefits of PPIs in clinical populations.
4532, A remarkable collaborative effort coordinated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) team at WHO resulted in discovery of the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome less than 2 months after the announcement of global alert.
4533,"The development of a vaccine to prevent SARS should be pursued with the same urgency and cooperative spirit, as SARS is highly lethal and, if not controlled during the first few generations of transmission, is likely to become endemic in regions of the world where health-care infrastructure is underdeveloped and epidemiological control measures are weak."
4534,The scientific community already learned many important lessons from HIV vaccine development; these should be heeded.
4535,"For example, consideration should be given to the development of a vaccine that will protect across regional strains of SARS, as the newly emergent coronavirus SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proving to be variable and may be mutating in response to immune pressure."
4536,SARS-specific research reagents should also be collected and shared.
4537,"These would include SARS peptides, adjuvants, DNA vaccine vectors and clinical grade viral vectors."
4538,Rapidly developing a collaborative approach to developing a SARS vaccine that will be both effective and safe is the only way to go.
4539,This article reviews parallels between HIV and SARS and proposes an approach that would accelerate the development of a SARS vaccine.
4540, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002 and spread to 29 countries.
4541,"By the end of the outbreak in July 2003, the CDC and WHO reported 8437 cases with a 9.6% case fatality rate."
4542,"The disease was caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS-CoV."
4543,"Drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines, several vaccine candidates have been developed and evaluated in pre-clinical trials."
4544,"Available data suggest that vaccines should be based on the the 180kDa viral spike protein, S, the only significant neutralization antigen capable of inducing protective immune responses in animals."
4545,"In the absence of clinical cases of SARS, candidate vaccines should be evaluated for efficacy in animal models, and although it is uncertain whether the United States Food and Drug Administration's “animal rule” would apply to licensure of a SARS vaccine, it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality."
4546,"This report summarizes the recommendations from a WHO Technical Meeting on Animal Models and Antibody Assays for Evaluating Candidate SARS Vaccines held on 25–26 August 2005 in South Mimms, UK, provides guidance on the use of animal models, and outlines the steps to develop standard reagents and assays for immunological evaluation of candidate SARS vaccines."
4547,: Carrageenan is a clinically proven and marketed compound for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections.
4548,As infections caused by influenza virus are often accompanied by infections with other respiratory viruses the combination of a specific anti-influenza compound with the broadly active antiviral polymer has huge potential for the treatment of respiratory infections.
4549,"Thus, the combination of the specific anti-influenza drug Zanamivir together with carrageenan in a formulation suitable for intranasal application was evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo."
4550,"PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show in-vitro that carrageenan and Zanamivir act synergistically against several influenza A virus strains (H1N1(09)pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7)."
4551,"Moreover, we demonstrate in a lethal influenza model with a low pathogenic H7N7 virus (HA closely related to the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus) and a H1N1(09)pdm influenza virus in C57BL/6 mice that the combined use of both compounds significantly increases survival of infected animals in comparison with both mono-therapies or placebo."
4552,"Remarkably, this benefit is maintained even when the treatment starts up to 72 hours post infection."
4553,CONCLUSION: A nasal spray containing carrageenan and Zanamivir should therefore be tested for prevention and treatment of uncomplicated influenza in clinical trials.
4554,The programmed death (PD)-1/PD-L1 pathway is a well-recognized negative immune checkpoint that results in functional inhibition of T-cells.
4555,"Microglia, the brain-resident immune cells are vital for pathogen detection and initiation of neuroimmune responses."
4556,"Moreover, microglial cells and astrocytes govern the activity of brain-infiltrating antiviral T-cells through upregulation of PD-L1 expression."
4557,"While T-cell suppressive responses within brain are undoubtedly beneficial to the host, preventing cytotoxic damage to this vital organ, establishment of a prolonged anti-inflammatory milieu may simultaneously lead to deficiencies in viral clearance."
4558,An immune checkpoint blockade targeting the PD-1: PD-L1 (B7-H1; CD274) axis has revolutionized contemporary treatment for a variety of cancers.
4559,"However, the therapeutic potential of PD1: PD-L1 blockade therapies targeting viral brain reservoirs remains to be determined."
4560,"For these reasons, it is key to understand both the detrimental and protective functions of this signaling pathway within the brain."
4561,"This review highlights how glial cells use PD-L1 expression to modulate T-cell effector function and limit detrimental bystander damage, while still retaining an effective defense of the brain."
4562,"Dengue virus infections can cause hemorrhagic fever, shock, encephalitis, and even death."
4563,"Worldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-infested regions with about 100 million new cases each year, although many of these infections are believed to be silent."
4564,"There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus; thus, immunity from one serotype will not cross-protect from infection with the other three."
4565,The difficulties that hamper vaccine development include requirements of the natural conformation of the envelope glycoprotein to induce neutralizing immune responses and the necessity of presenting antigens of all four serotypes.
4566,"Currently, the only way to meet these requirements is to use a mixture of four serotypes of live attenuated dengue viruses, but safety remains a major problem."
4567,"In this study, we have developed the basis for a tetravalent dengue vaccine using a novel complex adenovirus platform that is capable of expressing multiple antigens de novo."
4568,This dengue vaccine is constructed as a pair of vectors that each expresses the premembrane and envelope genes of two different dengue virus serotypes.
4569,"Upon vaccination, the vaccine expressed high levels of the dengue virus antigens in cells to mimic a natural infection and induced both humoral and cellular immune responses against multiple serotypes of dengue virus in an animal model."
4570,Further analyses show the humoral responses were indeed neutralizing against all four serotypes.
4571,Our studies demonstrate the concept of mimicking infections to induce immune responses by synthesizing dengue virus membrane antigens de novo and the feasibility of developing an effective tetravalent dengue vaccine by vector-mediated expression of glycoproteins of the four serotypes.
4572,"Despite the recent advances in controlling some viral pathogens, most viral infections still lack specific treatment."
4573,"Indeed, the need for effective therapeutic strategies to combat ‘old’, emergent, and re-emergent viruses is not paralleled by the approval of new antivirals."
4574,"In the past years, drug repurposing combined with innovative approaches for drug validation, and with appropriate animal models, significantly contributed to the identification of new antiviral molecules and targets for therapeutic intervention."
4575,"In this review, we describe the main strategies of drug repurposing in antiviral discovery, discuss the most promising candidates that could be repurposed to treat viral infections, and analyze the possible caveats of this trendy strategy of drug discovery."
4576,The United States (US) considers the intentional use of a biological agent a serious national security threat.
4577,"Over the last decade, federal, state, and local governments in the US have made concerted efforts to enhance preparedness within the public health, medical, and emergency response systems to address this threat."
4578,These activities span a wide range of areas from the enactment of new legal authorities and legislative changes to significant financial investments to enhance multiple detection and response system capabilities and the adoption of a national command and control structure for response.
4579,"Many of these investments, although prompted by the concern for bioterrorism, have served to strengthen public health, medical, and emergency response systems overall and have proven invaluable in responses to other large-scale emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic."
4580," Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a compound used in the baking and plastics industries, has been reported to cause pulmonary sensitization and dermatitis in people."
4581,Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA.
4582,"The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3."
4583,No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure.
4584,The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group.
4585,Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3.
4586,No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice.
4587,"In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3."
4588,No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed.
4589,The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3.
4590,No histopathological lesions were noted in mice.
4591,Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3.
4592,No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3.
4593,"All rats in the 50 mg DNA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung."
4594,"Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions."
4595,The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated.
4596,"Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA."
4597,No ADA was detected.
4598,"The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures."
4599,"However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period."
4600,"In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3."
4601,Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents.
4602,": Although several therapeutic options have become available for patients with Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), no therapy has been curative."
4603,Recent studies have demonstrated that CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4).
4604,"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV8) vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-Fc fusion (scFvFc or “minibody”) of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1567 was evaluated for curative treatment."
4605,Human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival.
4606,The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly-6G(+) FcγRIIIa(CD16A)(+) murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice.
4607,"Furthermore, in CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A(+) CD56(+) NK cells was observed."
4608,The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells.
4609,"CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our data demonstrate that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody is mediated, at least in part, through CD16A(+) immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms."
4610,These data further demonstrate the utility of the AAV-minibody gene transfer system in the rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs and the potency of h1567 as a potential novel therapy for CTCL.
4611,"In recent years, several paramyxoviruses have emerged to infect humans, including previously unidentified zoonoses."
4612,"Hendra and Nipah virus (henipavirus (HNV)) zoonoses were first identified in 1994 or 1998, causing deaths in animals and humans in Australia or Malaysia, respectively."
4613,"Other paramyxoviruses, such as menangle virus, tioman virus, human metapneumovirus, and avian paramyxovirus-1, with less morbidity in humans, have also been recently identified."
4614,"Although the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses has been previously recognized as biomedically and veterinarily important, the recent emergence of these paramyxoviruses has increased our attention to this family."
4615,Antiviral drugs can be designed to target specific important determinants of the viral/cell life cycle.
4616,"Therefore, identifying and understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of viral entry, replication, assembly, and budding will be critical in the development of antiviral therapeutic agents."
4617,"This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms discovered and the antiviral strategies pursued in recent years for emerging paramyxoviruses, with a concentration on viral entry and exit mechanisms."
4618," Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is one of the more primitive non-human primate species and is used widely in fundamental biology, pharmacology and toxicology studies."
4619,Marmosets breed well in captivity with good reproductive efficiencies and their sexual maturity is reached within 18months of age allowing for rapid expansion of colonies and early availability of sexually mature animals permitting an earlier assessment of product candidates in the adult.
4620,Their relatively small size allows a reduction in material requirements leading to a reduction in development time and cost.
4621,Fewer animals are also required due to their ability to be used in both pharmacology and toxicology (nonclinical) studies.
4622,"These factors, alongside a better understanding of their optimal nutrient and welfare requirements over recent years, facilitate the generation of a more cohesive and robust dataset."
4623,"With the growth of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, non-human primate use has, by necessity, also increased; nevertheless, there is also a growing public call for minimizing their use."
4624,"Utilizing, the more primitive marmoset species may provide the optimal compromise and once the scientific rationale has been carefully considered and their use justified, there are several advantages to using the marmoset as a model in nonclinical development of pharmaceutical products."
4625,Adjuvants potentiate antigen-specific protective immune responses and can be key elements promoting vaccine effectiveness.
4626,We previously reported that the Onchocerca volvulus recombinant protein rOv-ASP-1 can induce activation and maturation of naïve human DCs and therefore could be used as an innate adjuvant to promote balanced Th1 and Th2 responses to bystander vaccine antigens in mice.
4627,"With a few vaccine antigens, it also promoted a Th1-biased response based on pronounced induction of Th1-associated IgG2a and IgG2b antibody responses and the upregulated production of Th1 cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6."
4628,"However, because it is a protein, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant may also induce anti-self-antibodies."
4629,"Therefore, it was important to verify that the host responses to self will not affect the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 when it is used in subsequent vaccinations with the same or different vaccine antigens."
4630,"In this study, we have established rOv-ASP-1's adjuvanticity in mice during the course of two sequential vaccinations using two vaccine model systems: the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike protein and a commercial influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine comprised of three virus strains."
4631,"Moreover, the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 was retained with an efficacy similar to that obtained when it was used for a first vaccination, even though a high level of anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibodies was present in the sera of mice before the administration of the second vaccine."
4632,"To further demonstrate its utility as an adjuvant for human use, we also immunized non-human primates (NHPs) with RBD plus rOv-ASP-1 and showed that rOv-ASP-1 could induce high titres of functional and protective anti-RBD antibody responses in NHPs."
4633,"Notably, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant did not induce high titer antibodies against self in NHPs."
4634,"Thus, the present study provided a sound scientific foundation for future strategies in the development of this novel protein adjuvant."
4635,"Multiple sclerosis, the clinical features and pathological correlate for which were first described by Charcot, is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease with unknown etiology and variable clinical evolution."
4636,"Although neuroinflammation is a descriptive denominator in multiple sclerosis based on histopathological observations, namely the penetration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, the clinical symptoms of relapses, remissions and progressive paralysis are the result of losses of myelin and neurons."
4637,"In the absence of etiological factors as targets for prevention and therapy, the definition of molecular mechanisms that form the basis of inflammation, demyelination and toxicity for neurons have led to a number of treatments that slow down disease progression in specific patient cohorts, but that do not cure the disease."
4638,"Current therapies are directed to block the immune processes, both innate and adaptive, that are associated with multiple sclerosis."
4639,"In this review, we analyze the role of cytokines in the multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and current/future use of them in treatments of multiple sclerosis."
4640,": The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) represents an attractive animal model for the study of respiratory diseases, including influenza."
4641,"Despite its importance for biomedical research, the number of reagents for molecular and immunological analysis is restricted."
4642,"We present here a parallel sequencing effort to produce an extensive EST (expressed sequence tags) dataset derived from a normalized ferret cDNA library made from mRNA from ferret blood, liver, lung, spleen and brain."
4643,RESULTS: We produced more than 500000 sequence reads that were assembled into 16000 partial ferret genes.
4644,These genes were combined with the available ferret sequences in the GenBank to develop a ferret specific microarray platform.
4645,"Using this array, we detected tissue specific expression patterns which were confirmed by quantitative real time PCR assays."
4646,"We also present a set of 41 ferret genes with even transcription profiles across the tested tissues, indicating their usefulness as housekeeping genes."
4647,CONCLUSION: The tools developed in this study allow for functional genomic analysis and make further development of reagents for the ferret model possible.
4648,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric viral respiratory tract infections.
4649,Neither vaccine nor effective antiviral therapy is available to prevent and treat RSV infection.
4650,"Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the only product approved to prevent serious RSV infection, but its high cost is prohibitive in low-income countries."
4651,"Here, we aimed to identify an effective, safe, and affordable antiviral agent for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of RSV infection in children at high risk."
4652,"We found that maleic anhydride (ML)-modified human serum albumin (HSA), designated ML-HSA, exhibited potent antiviral activity against RSV and that the percentages of the modified lysines and arginies in ML- are correlated with such anti-RSV activity."
4653,"ML-HSA inhibited RSV entry and replication by interacting with viral G protein and blocking RSV attachment to the target cells, while ML-HAS neither bound to F protein, nor inhibited F protein-mediated membrane fusion."
4654,Intranasal administration of ML-HSA before RSV infection resulted in significant decrease of the viral titers in the lungs of mice.
4655,"ML-HSA shows promise for further development into an effective, safe, affordable, and easy-to-use intranasal regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis of RSV infection in children at high risk in both low- and high-income countries."
4656, Many survivors of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) developed residual pulmonary fibrosis with increased severity seen in older patients.
4657,Autopsies of patients that died from SARS also showed fibrosis to varying extents.
4658,Pulmonary fibrosis can be occasionally seen as a consequence to several respiratory viral infections but is much more common after a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection.
4659,"Given the threat of future outbreaks of severe coronavirus disease, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), it is important to understand the mechanisms responsible for pulmonary fibrosis, so as to support the development of therapeutic countermeasures and mitigate sequelae of infection."
4660,"In this article, we summarize pulmonary fibrotic changes observed after a SARS-CoV infection, discuss the extent to which other respiratory viruses induce fibrosis, describe available animal models to study the development of SARS-CoV induced fibrosis and review evidence that pulmonary fibrosis is caused by a hyperactive host response to lung injury mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling."
4661,We summarize work from our group and others indicating that inhibiting EGFR signaling may prevent an excessive fibrotic response to SARS-CoV and other respiratory viral infections and propose directions for future research.
4662, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand-foot-and-mouth diseases as well as neurological complications in young children.
4663,Interferon (IFN) can inhibit the replication of many viruses with low cytotoxic effects.
4664,"Previously, an adenovirus vectored mouse interferon-α (DEF201), subtype 5, was generated by Wu et al, 2007."
4665,"In this study, the antiviral effects of DEF201 against EV71 were evaluated in a murine model."
4666,6–day-old BALB/c mice were administered a single dose of DEF201 before or after infection with lethal dose of EV71.
4667,"The survival rate, clinical symptoms, tissue viral loads and histology pathogenesis were evaluated."
4668,IFN gene expression following a single dose of DEF201 maintained high concentrations of 100–9000 pg/mL for more than 7 days in mice serum.
4669,Pre-infection administration of a single dose of 106 PFU of DEF201 offered full protection of the mice against EV71 infection compared with the empty Ad5 vector control.
4670,"In addition, virus load in DEF201-treated mice muscle tissue was significantly decreased as compared with empty vector control."
4671,Histopathology analysis revealed that DEF201 significantly prevented the development of severe tissue damage with reduction of viral antigen in the murine muscle tissue.
4672,"Post-infection treatment at 6 h offered full protection and partial protection at 12 h, indicating that DEF201 could be used as an anti-EV71 therapeutic agent in early stage of EV71 infection."
4673,"In addition, our study showed that DEF201 enhanced the neutralization ability of serum in EV71-vaccinated mice, implying that DEF201 could promote the production of specific anti-EV71 antibodies."
4674,"In conclusion, single dose of DEF201 is highly efficacious as a prophylactic agent against EV71 infection in vivo."
4675,The 2014–15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics.
4676,"Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens."
4677,Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer.
4678,"ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors."
4679,"For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen."
4680,"Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa fever, Nipah and MERS."
4681," The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 marked the second time that a new, highly pathogenic coronavirus has emerged in the human population in the 21st century."
4682,"In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of animal models of MERS-CoV infection."
4683,"Commonly used laboratory animal species such as Syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, due to differences in the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)."
4684,"The initially developed animal models comprise two nonhuman primate species, the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset."
4685,"Rhesus macaques develop a mild to moderate respiratory disease upon inoculation, reminiscent of milder MERS cases, whereas marmosets develop a moderate to severe respiratory disease, recapitulating the severe disease observed in some patients."
4686,"Dromedary camels, considered to be the reservoir for MERS-CoV, develop a mild upper respiratory tract infection with abundant viral shedding."
4687,"Although normal mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, expression of the human DPP4 (hDPP4) overcomes the lack of susceptibility."
4688,Transgenic hDPP4 mice develop severe and lethal respiratory disease upon inoculation with MERS-CoV.
4689,These hDPP4 transgenic mice are potentially the ideal first line animal model for efficacy testing of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures.
4690,"Further characterization of identified countermeasures would ideally be performed in the common marmoset model, due to the more severe disease outcome."
4691,This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on “From SARS to MERS: research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.”
4692,"Polyclonal antibodies have a century-old history of being effective against some viruses; recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success."
4693,The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab) remains still the only mAb against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
4694,"Recently, several potent human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) targeting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Associated coronavirus (SARS CoV) S glycoproteins were developed quickly after the virus was identified in 2003."
4695,"Among these antibodies, m396 and S230.15 exhibit exceptional potency and cross-reactivity as they neutralize isolates from the first and second outbreaks and from palm civets both in vitroand in mice."
4696,"Similarly, the first fully hmAbs against two other paramyxoviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), which can cause up to 75% mortality, were recently developed; one of them, m102.4, shows exceptional cross-reactive potency against both NiV and HeV."
4697,Three-dimensional molecular structures of envelope glycoproteins from these viruses in complexes with antibodies and/or receptors were recently determined.
4698,"Structural analyses along with other experiments have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of receptor recognition and antibody neutralization, and suggested that these antibodies alone or in combination could successfully fight the viruses’ heterogeneity and mutability which is a major problem in the development of effective therapeutic agents against viruses, including therapeutic antibodies."
4699,We designed and produced a self-assembling protein nanoparticle.
4700,"This self-assembling protein nanoparticle contains five CD8(+) HLA-A03-11 supertypes-restricted epitopes from antigens expressed during Toxoplasma gondii’s lifecycle, the universal CD4(+) T cell epitope PADRE, and flagellin as a scaffold and TLR5 agonist."
4701,These CD8(+) T cell epitopes were separated by N/KAAA spacers and optimized for proteasomal cleavage.
4702,Self-assembling protein nanoparticle adjuvanted with TLR4 ligand-emulsion GLA-SE were evaluated for their efficacy in inducing IFN-γ responses and protection of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against T. gondii.
4703,"Immunization, using self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE, activated CD8(+) T cells to produce IFN-γ."
4704,Self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE also protected HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against subsequent challenge with Type II parasites.
4705,"Hence, combining CD8(+) T cell-eliciting peptides and PADRE into a multi-epitope protein that forms a nanoparticle, administered with GLA-SE, leads to efficient presentation by major histocompatibility complex Class I and II molecules."
4706,"Furthermore, these results suggest that activation of TLR4 and TLR5 could be useful for development of vaccines that elicit T cells to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans."
4707," Phase I human clinical studies involving therapeutics for emerging and biodefense pathogens with low incidence, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), requires at a minimum preclinical evaluation of efficacy in two well-characterized and robust animal models."
4708,"Thus, a ferret SARS-CoV model was evaluated over a period of 58 days following extensive optimization and characterization of the model in order to validate clinical, histopathological, virological and immunological endpoints."
4709,Ferrets that were infected intranasally with 103 TCID50 SARS-CoV showed higher body temperature (2–6 d.p.i.
4710,"), sneezing (5–10 d.p.i."
4711,"), lesions (5–7 d.p.i.)"
4712,and decreased WBC/lymphocytes (2–5 d.p.i.).
4713,SARS-CoV was detected up to 7 d.p.i.
4714,"in various tissues and excreta, while neutralizing antibody titers rose at 7 d.p.i."
4715,and peaked at 14 d.p.i.
4716,"At 29 d.p.i., one group was challenged with 103 TCID50 SARS-CoV, and an anamnestic response in neutralizing antibodies was evident with no detectable virus."
4717,This study supports the validity of the ferret model for use in evaluating efficacy of potential therapeutics to treat SARS.
4718,The uncontrolled progression of the aids epidemic has made the development of an efficacious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine a major objective of scientific research.
4719,No effective preventive vaccine against HIV is currently available and sterilizing immunity has not yet been achieved in animal models.
4720,"This review analyses the major challenges in developing an aids vaccine, in particular the mechanisms involved in viral escape from the immune response, and summarizes the results obtained with the different prototypes of therapeutic and preventive vaccines."
4721,"Finally, social, economic and healthcare aspects of research into HIV vaccines and current controversies regarding the development of clinical trials are discussed."
4722,The robustness of immune responses to an antigen could be dictated by the route of vaccine inoculation.
4723,"Traditional smallpox vaccines, essentially vaccinia virus strains, that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation (skin scarification)."
4724,The modified vaccinia virus Ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the United States.
4725,MVA is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization.
4726,"Since MVA is replication-deficient, MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes."
4727,"Vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles, and an estimated 10 to 20% of the population of the United States has needle phobia."
4728,"Following an observation in our laboratory that a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the New York City Board of Health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification, we investigated whether MVA and MVA recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models."
4729,"Our data suggest that MVA administered by percutaneous inoculation, elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses, and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge, at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation."
4730,High titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant MVA expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein D after scarification.
4731,"Similarly, a recombinant MVA expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification."
4732,"Taken together, our data suggest that MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination, and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited."
4733, Vaccines are considered one of the greatest advances in modern medicine.
4734,"The global burden of numerous infectious diseases has been significantly reduced, and in some cases, effectively eradicated through the deployment of specific vaccines."
4735,"However, efforts to develop effective new vaccines against infectious pathogens such as influenza, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV) have proven challenging."
4736,"Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands dating back over 50 years."
4737,"Over this period, ZIKV infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever, arthralgia, and rash in others."
4738,"Concerns about ZIKV changed over the past two years, however, as outbreaks in Brazil, Central American countries, and Caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes."
4739,"Cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to ZIKV infected mothers, as well as an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults."
4740,"These findings prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2016, which resulted in expanded efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines and immunotherapeutics."
4741,"Several ZIKV vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking ZIKV infection in animal models have since been developed, with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic."
4742,Additional therapeutics under investigation include anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been shown to neutralize infection in vitro as well as protect against morbidity in mouse models of ZIKV infection.
4743,"In this review, we summarize the current understanding of ZIKV biology and describe our efforts to rapidly develop a vaccine against ZIKV."
4744,Cryptosporidiosis is a significant diarrhoeal disease in both people and animals across the world and is caused by several species of the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium.
4745,"Recent research has highlighted the longer-term consequences of the disease for malnourished children, involving growth stunting and cognitive deficits, and significant growth and production losses for livestock."
4746,"There are no vaccines currently available to prevent the disease and few treatment options in either humans or animals, which has been a significant limiting factor in disease control to date."
4747,"A One Health approach to tackle zoonotic cryptosporidiosis looking at new advances in veterinary, public, and environmental health research may offer several advantages and new options to help control the disease."
4748,The past decade and a half has been characterized by numerous emerging infectious diseases.
4749,"With each new threat, there has been a call for rapid vaccine development."
4750,Pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Zika virus represent either new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications.
4751,Both serve as paradigms for the global spread that can accompany new pathogens.
4752,"In this paper, we review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and Zika virus with respect to vaccine development."
4753,The challenges in vaccine development and the approach to clinical trial design to test vaccine candidates for disease entities with a changing epidemiology are discussed.
4754,: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute viral hepatitis in the world with an estimated 20 million infections per year.
4755,"Although the mortality rate is less than 1% among the general population, pregnant women can have a fatality rate of up to 30%."
4756,"Additionally, chronic hepatitis E has increasingly become a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised individuals."
4757,Effective antivirals against HEV are needed.
4758,"AREAS COVERED: This review article addresses the current state of knowledge of HEV infections with regard to animal and cell culture model systems that are important for antiviral discovery and testing, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of virus replication, our understanding of how each viral protein functions, and areas that can potentially be exploited as therapeutic targets."
4759,"EXPERT OPINION: Lack of an efficient cell culture system for HEV propagation, the limited knowledge of HEV lifecycle, and the inherent self-limiting infection within the normal populace make the development of new therapeutic agents against HEV challenging."
4760,"There are many promising therapeutic targets, and the tools for identifying and testing potential antivirals are rapidly evolving."
4761,The development of effective therapeutics against HEV in immunocompromised and pregnant patient populations is warranted.
4762, Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans.
4763,"While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East."
4764,"Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat."
4765,Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses.
4766,"With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection."
4767,"In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV."
4768,This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor.
4769,"We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV."
4770,The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of Guillain Barre and other neurological disorders as well as congenital defects that include microcephaly has created an urgent need to develop animal models to examine the pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines.
4771,Recently developed infection models for ZIKV utilize mice defective in interferon responses.
4772,"In this study we establish and characterize a new model of peripheral ZIKV infection using immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribution, immune response, and neuropathology with that of C57BL/6-IFNAR KO mice."
4773,"We show that while ZIKV infected IFNAR KO mice develop bilateral hind limb paralysis and die 5–6 days post-infection (dpi), immunocompetent B6 WT mice develop signs of neurological disease including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures by 13 dpi that subside gradually over 2 weeks."
4774,Immunohistochemistry show viral antigen predominantly in cerebellum at the peak of the disease in both models.
4775,"However, whereas IFNAR KO mice showed infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages and higher expression of IL-1, IL-6 and Cox2, B6 WT mice show a cellular infiltration in the CNS composed predominantly of T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, and increased mRNA expression levels of IFNg, GzmB and Prf1 at peak of disease."
4776,"Lastly, the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of neurodegeneration predominantly in the cerebellum that are less prominent in mice lacking the IFN response possibly due to the difference in cellular infiltrates and rapid progression of the disease in that model."
4777,The development of the B6 WT model of ZIKV infection will provide insight into the immunopathology of the virus and facilitate assessments of possible therapeutics and vaccines.
4778,Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes a cAMP-regulated anion channel.
4779,"Although CF is a multi-organ system disease, most people with CF die of progressive lung disease that begins early in childhood and is characterized by chronic bacterial infection and inflammation."
4780,"Nearly 90% of people with CF have at least one copy of the ΔF508 mutation, but there are hundreds of CFTR mutations that result in a range of disease severities."
4781,A CFTR gene replacement approach would be efficacious regardless of the disease-causing mutation.
4782,"After the discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989, the in vitro proof-of-concept for gene therapy for CF was quickly established in 1990."
4783,"In 1993, the first of many gene therapy clinical trials attempted to rescue the CF defect in airway epithelia."
4784,"Despite the initial enthusiasm, there is still no FDA-approved gene therapy for CF."
4785,"Here we discuss the history of CF gene therapy, from the discovery of the CFTR gene to current state-of-the-art gene delivery vector designs."
4786,"While implementation of CF gene therapy has proven more challenging than initially envisioned; thanks to continued innovation, it may yet become a reality."
4787,Severe noninfectious adverse events (AEs) and transmission of pathogens by plasma-derived protein concentrates from the very beginning of their clinical use were threats for recipients (see Chap.
4788,10.1007/978-3-319-68038-5_11 for additional information).
4789,“Standard IgG” preparations were the first available for clinical use.
4790,They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception.
4791,Noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported.
4792,"Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001)."
4793,Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH.
4794,The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe.
4795,"In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP)."
4796,The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products.
4797,Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities.
4798,This in turn resulted in a paradigm shift how the modern plasma industry operates (Steinhardt 1998).
4799,"The products resulting for biotechnologies continue to grow at an exponential rate, and the expectations are that an even greater percentage of drug development will be in the area of the biologics."
4800,"In 2011, worldwide there were over 800 new biotech drugs and treatments in development including 23 antisense, 64 cell therapy, 50 gene therapy, 300 monoclonal antibodies, 78 recombinant proteins, and 298 vaccines (PhRMA 2012)."
4801,Pharmaceutical biotechnology techniques are at the core of most methodologies used today for drug discovery and development of both biologics and small molecules.
4802,"While recombinant DNA technology and hybridoma techniques were the major methods utilized in pharmaceutical biotechnology through most of its historical timeline, our ever-widening understanding of human cellular function and disease processes and a wealth of additional and innovative biotechnologies have been, and will continue to be, developed in order to harvest the information found in the human genome."
4803,"These technological advances will provide a better understanding of the relationship between genetics and biological function, unravel the underlying causes of disease, explore the association of genomic variation and drug response, enhance pharmaceutical research, and fuel the discovery and development of new and novel biopharmaceuticals."
4804,"These revolutionary technologies and additional biotechnology-related techniques are improving the very competitive and costly process of drug development of new medicinal agents, diagnostics, and medical devices."
4805,Some of the technologies and techniques described in this chapter are both well established and commonly used applications of biotechnology producing potential therapeutic products now in development including clinical trials.
4806,New techniques are emerging at a rapid and unprecedented pace and their full impact on the future of molecular medicine has yet to be imagined.
4807, The hepatitis E virus is a common cause of acute hepatitis.
4808,"Contrary to hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is mostly a mild infection, although it has a high mortality in pregnant women and can evolve to chronicity in immunocompromised patients."
4809,"Ribavirin and pegylated interferon-α are the only available therapies, but both have side effects that are not acceptable for prophylaxis or treatment of mild infections."
4810,"In addition, these drugs cannot be used for all patient types (e.g."
4811,"in case of pregnancy, specific organ transplants or co-morbidities) and in resource-poor settings."
4812,"Hence there is an urgent need for better antiviral treatments that are efficacious and safe, also during pregnancy."
4813,"In this review, a concise introduction to the virus and disease is provided, followed by a discussion of the available assay systems and potential molecular targets (viral proteins and host factors) for the development of inhibitors of HEV replication."
4814,"Finally, directions for future research are presented."
4815,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) molecules that can regulate mRNAs by inducing their degradation or by blocking translation.
4816,"Considering that miRNAs are ubiquitous, stable, and conserved across animal species, it seems feasible to exploit them for clinical applications."
4817,"Unlike in human viral diseases, where some miRNA-based molecules have progressed to clinical application, in veterinary medicine, this concept is just starting to come into view."
4818,"Clinically, miRNAs could represent powerful diagnostic tools to pinpoint animal viral diseases and/or prognostic tools to follow up disease progression or remission."
4819,"Additionally, the possible consequences of miRNA dysregulation make them potential therapeutic targets and open the possibilities to use them as tools to generate viral disease-resistant livestock."
4820,This review presents an update of preclinical studies on using sncRNAs to combat viral diseases that affect pet and farm animals.
4821,"Moreover, we discuss the possibilities and challenges of bringing these bench-based discoveries to the veterinary clinic."
4822,Vaccines are the most effective and inexpensive prophylactic tool in veterinary medicine.
4823,"Ideally, vaccines should induce a lifelong protective immunity against the target pathogen while not causing clinical or pathological signs of diseases in the vaccinated animals."
4824,"However, such ideal vaccines are rare in the veterinary field."
4825,Many vaccines are either of limited effectiveness or have harmful side effects.
4826,"In addition, there are still severe diseases with no effective vaccines."
4827,"A very important criterion for an ideal vaccine in veterinary medicine is low cost; this is especially important in developing countries and even more so for poultry vaccination, where vaccines must sell for a few cents a dose."
4828,"Traditional approaches include inactivated vaccines, attenuated live vaccines and subunit vaccines."
4829,"Recently, genetic engineering has been applied to design new, improved vaccines."
4830,Adenovirus vectors are highly efficient for gene transfer in a broad spectrum of cell types and species.
4831,"Moreover, adenoviruses often induce humoral, mucosal and cellular immune responses to antigens encoded by the inserted foreign genes."
4832,"Thus, adenoviruses have become a vector of choice for delivery and expression of foreign proteins for vaccination."
4833,"Consequently, the market requirements for adenovirus vaccines are increasing, creating a need for production methodologies of concentrated vectors with warranted purity and efficacy."
4834,"This review summarizes recent developments and approaches of adenovirus production and purification as the application of these vectors, including successes and failures in clinical applications to date."
4835," Ethnopharmacological relevance According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, influenza is categorized as a warm disease or Wen Bing."
4836,"The Wen Bing formulas, such as Yin-Qiao-San and Sang-Ju-Yin, are still first-line herbal therapies in combating variant influenza virus."
4837,"To continue our study on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between Wen Bing formulas and oseltamivir (OS), the first-line western drug for the treatment of influenza, further interactions between OS and the eight single herbs and their relevant marker components from Wen Bing formulas were investigated in the current study."
4838,Aim of study To establish an in-vitro screening platform for investigation of the potential anti-influenza herbs/herbal components that may have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with OS.
4839,"Materials and methods To screen potential inhibition on OS hydrolysis, 1 μg/mL of OS is incubated with herbs/herbal components in diluted rat plasma, microsomes and human recombinant carboxylesterase 1(hCE1) under optimized conditions."
4840,MDCK-WT and MDCK-MDR1 cell lines are utilized to identify potential modification on P-gp mediated transport of OS by herbs/herbal components.
4841,Caco-2 cells with and without Gly-Sar inhibition are performed to study the uptake of OS via PEPT1 transporters.
4842,Modification on OAT3 mediated transport is verified by the uptake of OS on HEK293-MOCK/HEK293-OAT3 cells.
4843,Anti-virus effects were evaluated using plaque reduction assay on H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.
4844,"Potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between OS (30 mg/kg) and the selected herb, Radix Scutellariae (RS), at 300–600 mg/kg were carried out on rats."
4845,All samples are analyzed by an LC/MS/MS method for the contents of OS and OSA.
4846,A mechanistic PK model was developed to interpret the HDI between OS and RS in rats.
4847,"Results Our developed platform was successfully applied to screen the eight herbal extracts and their ten marker components on metabolic inhibition of OS and modification of OS transport mediated by P-gp, OAT3 and PEPT1."
4848,"Results from six in-vitro experiments were analyzed after converting raw data from each experiment to corresponding fold-change (FC) values, based on which Radix Scutellariae (RS) were selected to have the most HDI potential with OS."
4849,"By analyzing the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic data after co-administration of OS with a standardized RS extract in rats using an integrated population pharmacokinetics model, it is suggested that RS could inhibit OS hydrolysis during absorption and increase the absorbed fraction of OS, which leads to the increased ratio of OS concentration versus that of OSA in both rat plasma and urine."
4850,"Never the less, the anti-virus effects of 2.5 h post-dose rat plasma were not influenced by co-administration of OS with RS."
4851,Conclusion A six-dimension in-vitro screening platform has been developed and successfully applied to find RS as a potential herb that would influence the co-administrated OS in rats.
4852,"Although co-administered RS could inhibit OS hydrolysis during absorption and increase the absorbed fraction of OS, which lead to the increased ratio of OS concentration versus that of OSA in both rat plasma and urine, the anti-virus effect of OS was not influenced by co-administered RS."
4853,The recent outbreak of the human Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) epidemic is spiraling out of control in West Africa.
4854,Human EBOV hemorrhagic fever has a case fatality rate of up to 90%.
4855,"The EBOV is classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen and is considered a category A agent of bioterrorism by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with no approved therapies and vaccines available for its treatment apart from supportive care."
4856,"Although several promising therapeutic agents and vaccines against EBOV are undergoing the Phase I human trial, the current epidemic might be outpacing the speed at which drugs and vaccines can be produced."
4857,"Like all viruses, the EBOV largely relies on host cell factors and physiological processes for its entry, replication, and egress."
4858,We have reviewed currently available therapeutic agents that have been shown to be effective in suppressing the proliferation of the EBOV in cell cultures or animal studies.
4859,"Most of the therapeutic agents in this review are directed against non-mutable targets of the host, which is independent of viral mutation."
4860,These medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other diseases.
4861,They are available and stockpileable for immediate use.
4862,They may also have a complementary role to those therapeutic agents under development that are directed against the mutable targets of the EBOV.
4863,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/2049-9957-3-43) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
4864,"The Human Viral Challenge (HVC) model has, for many decades, helped in the understanding of respiratory viruses and their role in disease pathogenesis."
4865,"In a controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers removed from community exposure to other infections, this experimental model enables proof of concept work to be undertaken on novel therapeutics, including vaccines, immunomodulators and antivirals, as well as new diagnostics."
4866,"Crucially, unlike conventional phase 1 studies, challenge studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints that then guide decisions on how to optimise subsequent field studies, as recommended by the FDA and thus licensing studies that follow."
4867,"Such a strategy optimises the benefit of the studies and identifies possible threats early on, minimising the risk to subsequent volunteers but also maximising the benefit of scarce resources available to the research group investing in the research."
4868,"Inspired by the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) now commonly applied in the preclinical phase, HVC studies allow refinement and reduction of the subsequent development phase, accelerating progress towards further statistically powered phase 2b studies."
4869,The breadth of data generated from challenge studies allows for exploration of a wide range of variables and endpoints that can then be taken through to pivotal phase 3 studies.
4870,We describe the disease burden for acute respiratory viral infections for which current conventional development strategies have failed to produce therapeutics that meet clinical need.
4871,The Authors describe the HVC model’s utility in increasing scientific understanding and in progressing promising therapeutics through development.
4872,"The contribution of the model to the elucidation of the virus-host interaction, both regarding viral pathogenicity and the body’s immunological response is discussed, along with its utility to assist in the development of novel diagnostics."
4873,Future applications of the model are also explored.
4874,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12931-018-0784-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
4875,The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as a cause of severe respiratory disease highlights the need for effective approaches to CoV vaccine development.
4876,Efforts focused solely on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein may not optimize neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses.
4877,Here we show that immunogens based on full-length S DNA and S1 subunit protein elicit robust serum-neutralizing activity against several MERS-CoV strains in mice and non-human primates.
4878,"Serological analysis and isolation of murine monoclonal antibodies revealed that immunization elicits NAbs to RBD and, non-RBD portions of S1 and S2 subunit."
4879,"Multiple neutralization mechanisms were demonstrated by solving the atomic structure of a NAb-RBD complex, through sequencing of neutralization escape viruses and by constructing MERS-CoV S variants for serological assays."
4880,"Immunization of rhesus macaques confers protection against MERS-CoV-induced radiographic pneumonia, as assessed using computerized tomography, supporting this strategy as a promising approach for MERS-CoV vaccine development."
4881,"Passive immunity can be provided to animals by several sources of antibodies including from colostrum, avian eggs, and monoclonal sources."
4882,These antibodies have been shown protect production and companion animals from a number of pathogens.
4883,This chapter reviews the immune system for the principles of immune response to antigens and the synthesis of immunoglobulins of the five classes of antibodies in the body.
4884,Colostrum antibodies are described for passive immunity protection in animals such as calves.
4885,Chicken egg antibodies are another source of antibodies for passive immunity.
4886,Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are also used to provide passive immunity in the veterinary field.
4887,"T lymphocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) (Zhang et al., 1992)."
4888,"Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been demonstrated in MS lesions, with CD4+ T cells predominating in acute lesions and CD8+ T cells being observed more frequently in chronic lesions (Raine, 1994)."
4889,"Additionally, T cells are found in all four of the described histopathologic subtypes of MS (Lucchinetti et al., 2000)."
4890,"Activated myelin‐reactive CD4+ T cells are present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients; in contrast, only nonactivated myelin‐reactive T cells are present in the blood of controls (Zhang et al., 1994)."
4891,The success of several T‐cell‐targeted therapies in MS reinforces the importance of the role of the T cell in MS pathogenesis.
4892,"Here, we outline basic concepts in CD4+ T‐cell immunology and summarize the current understanding of the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MS."
4893,"Covalent modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a non-toxic polymer used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations for over 60 years, can profoundly influence the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic and toxciologic profile of protein and peptide-based therapeutics."
4894,"This review summarizes the history of PEGylation and PEG chemistry and highlights the value of this technology in the context of the design and development of recombinant viruses for gene transfer, vaccination and diagnostic purposes."
4895,"Specific emphasis is placed on the application of this technology to the adenovirus, the most potent viral vector with the most highly characterized toxicity profile to date, in several animal models."
4896,Viruses of the family Filoviridae represent significant health risks as emerging infectious diseases as well as potentially engineered biothreats.
4897,"While many research efforts have been published offering possibilities toward the mitigation of filoviral infection, there remain no sanctioned therapeutic or vaccine strategies."
4898,"Current progress in the development of filovirus therapeutics and vaccines is outlined herein with respect to their current level of testing, evaluation, and proximity toward human implementation, specifically with regard to human clinical trials, nonhuman primate studies, small animal studies, and in vitro development."
4899,Contemporary methods of supportive care and previous treatment approaches for human patients are also discussed.
4900,"Understanding the interactions between host and pathogen is important for the development and assessment of medical countermeasures to infectious agents, including potential biodefence pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis, Ebola virus, and Francisella tularensis."
4901,This review focuses on technological advances which allow this interaction to be studied in much greater detail.
4902,"Namely, the use of “omic” technologies (next generation sequencing, DNA, and protein microarrays) for dissecting the underlying host response to infection at the molecular level; optical imaging techniques (flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy) for assessing cellular responses to infection; and biophotonic imaging for visualising the infectious disease process."
4903,All of these technologies hold great promise for important breakthroughs in the rational development of vaccines and therapeutics for biodefence agents.
4904, The study of human-specific infectious agents has been hindered by the lack of optimal small animal models.
4905,More recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents.
4906,"The introduction of a targeted mutation in the IL2 receptor common gamma chain gene (IL2rgnull) in mice already deficient in T and B cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells, as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues, effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice."
4907,These humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and other human-specific infectious agents.
4908,"However, there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents."
4909,"This is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies, which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice, including; i) modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity, which impedes human cell engraftment; ii) genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function; iii) and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols."
4910,"The development of “next generation” humanized mouse models continues to provide exciting opportunities for the establishment of robust small animal models to study the pathogenesis of human-specific infectious agents, as well as for testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents and experimental vaccines."
4911," After the great success of the research and development of antiviral drugs to treat chronic infections like HIV and hepatitis C, attention is turning to treatment of acute viral infections."
4912,"In this article, we illustrate the potential for developing antiviral drugs to treat such infections."
4913,Four distinct clinical problems caused by four different viruses allow exploration of the problems associated with each disease.
4914,"Targets for each virus are evaluated, and the progress made to date in identifying suitable clinical candidates is discussed."
4915,"Finally, we consider the problem of emerging acute virus infections and improving rapidity of responses to them."
4916,Vaccines are one of the miracles of modern medicine.
4917,"Without vaccines, the population—particularly children—would be troubled with multitudinous infectious diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and measles, just to name a few."
4918,Vaccines are available against both viral and bacterial infections; they have saved millions of lives and continue to do so.
4919,The World Health Organization hopes to have vaccinated all children under a year old against most infectious diseases by 2020.
4920,The history of the public’s acceptance of vaccines has been a stormy one.
4921,Anti-vaccination movements have been active since the creation or development of the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century and in government-mandated vaccination until the present.
4922,An example of this is the fabricated information spread about the relationship between measles vaccine and autism.
4923,"A successful polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s thanks to the research of three groups, led by Koprowski, Salk and Sabin, although each of these vaccines has its advantages and disadvantages."
4924,An oral vaccine has the advantage of ease of administration and a herd effect.
4925,Polio vaccine workers have become targets of extremists in Nigeria and Pakistan.
4926,"Recently, recombinant DNA technology, was used to develop new vaccines in order to avoid the side effects, since live virus is not involved."
4927,"The future may see the production of vaccines in edible plants, allowing for cheap production and ease in worldwide distribution."
4928, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is considered one of the major public health concerns with case fatality rates of up to 80%.
4929,"Currently, there is no effective approved vaccine for CCHF."
4930,"In this study, we used a computer-aided vaccine design approach to develop the first multi-epitope recombinant vaccine for CCHF."
4931,"For this purpose, linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from two structural glycoproteins of CCHF virus including Gc and Gn were predicted."
4932,"The epitopes were further studied regarding their antigenicity, allergenicity, hydrophobicity, stability, toxicity and population coverage."
4933,A total number of seven epitopes including five T-cell and two B-cell epitopes were screened for the final vaccine construct.
4934,"Final vaccine construct composed of 382 amino acid residues which were organized in four domains including linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) along with heat labile enterotoxin IIc B subunit (LT-IIc) as adjuvants."
4935,All the segments were joined using appropriate linkers.
4936,"The physicochemical properties as well as the presence of IFN-γ inducing epitopes in the proposed vaccine, was also checked to determining the vaccine stability, solubility and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses."
4937,The 3D structure of proposed vaccine was subjected to the prediction of computational B-cell epitopes and molecular docking studies with MHC-I and II molecules.
4938,"Furthermore, molecular dynamics stimulations were performed to study the vaccine-MHCs complexes stability during stimulation time."
4939,"The results suggest that our proposed vaccine was stable, well soluble in water and potentially antigenic."
4940,Results also demonstrated that the vaccine can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and could serve as a promising anti-CCHF vaccine candidate.
4941, Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a natural infection of domestic cats that results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resembling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans.
4942,The worldwide prevalence of FIV infection in domestic cats has been reported to range from 1 to 28%.
4943,"Hence, an effective FIV vaccine will have an important impact on veterinary medicine in addition to being used as a small animal AIDS model for humans."
4944,"Since the discovery of FIV reported in 1987, FIV vaccine research has pursued both molecular and conventional vaccine approaches toward the development of a commercial product."
4945,Published FIV vaccine trial results from 1998 to the present have been compiled to update the veterinary clinical and research communities on the immunologic and experimental efficacy status of these vaccines.
4946,"A brief report is included on the outcome of the 10 years of collaborative work between industry and academia which led to recent USDA approval of the first animal lentivirus vaccine, the dual-subtype FIV vaccine."
4947,"The immunogenicity and efficacy of the experimental prototype, dual-subtype FIV vaccine and the efficacy of the currently approved commercial, dual-subtype FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax FIV) are discussed."
4948,"Potential cross-reactivity complications between commercial FIV diagnostic tests, Idexx Snap Combo Test® and Western blot assays, and sera from previously vaccinated cats are also discussed."
4949,"Finally, recommendations are made for unbiased critical testing of new FIV vaccines, the currently USDA approved vaccine, and future vaccines in development."
4950,"In the two decades since their initial discovery, DNA vaccines technologies have come a long way."
4951,"Unfortunately, when applied to human subjects inadequate immunogenicity is still the biggest challenge for practical DNA vaccine use."
4952,"Many different strategies have been tested in preclinical models to address this problem, including novel plasmid vectors and codon optimization to enhance antigen expression, new gene transfection systems or electroporation to increase delivery efficiency, protein or live virus vector boosting regimens to maximise immune stimulation, and formulation of DNA vaccines with traditional or molecular adjuvants."
4953,Better understanding of the mechanisms of action of DNA vaccines has also enabled better use of the intrinsic host response to DNA to improve vaccine immunogenicity.
4954,This review summarizes recent advances in DNA vaccine technologies and related intracellular events and how these might impact on future directions of DNA vaccine development.
4955,Efforts towards developing a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have yielded promising results.
4956,"Utilizing a variety of platforms, several vaccine approaches have shown efficacy in animal models and begun to enter clinical trials."
4957,"In this review, we summarize the current progress towards a MERS-CoV vaccine and highlight potential roadblocks identified from previous attempts to generate coronavirus vaccines."
4958, The frequency of PRRSV corresponding to live vaccines and wild-type was determined in 902 pigs from North-Western Germany submitted for post-mortem examination.
4959,"Overall, 18.5% of the samples were positive for the EU wild-type virus."
4960,EU genotype vaccine virus was detected in 1.3% and the NA genotype vaccine virus in 8.9% of all samples.
4961,The detection of the EU vaccine was significantly higher in pigs vaccinated with the corresponding vaccine (OR=9.4).
4962,"Pigs vaccinated with NA genotype had significantly higher detection chances for the corresponding vaccine virus when compared to non-vaccinated animals (OR=3.34) animals, however, NA vaccine was also frequently detected in non-vaccinated pigs."
4963,"Concluding, the dynamics of NA genotype vaccine and EU wild-type virus corresponds with studies on PRRSV spread in endemically infected herds."
4964,The potential of spontaneous spread of the NA genotype vaccine should be considered in the planning of eradication programs.
4965," The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was created as a result of an emerging global consensus that a coordinated, international, and intergovernmental effort was needed to develop and deploy new vaccines to prevent future epidemics."
4966,"Although some disease outbreaks can be relatively brief, early outbreak response activities can provide important opportunities to make progress on vaccine development."
4967,"CEPI has identified six such areas and is prepared to work with other organisations in the global community to combat WHO priority pathogens, including the hypothetical Disease X, by supporting early activities in these areas, even when vaccine candidates are not yet available."
4968,The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in infants and young children has increased dramatically in recent years in the United States.
4969,"AOM often follows upper respiratory tract infections due to pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus (PIV)."
4970,These viruses cause eustachian tube dysfunction that is critical to the pathogenesis of AOM.
4971,Vaccines against these viruses would likely reduce the incidence of AOM.
4972,"In three previous studies, influenza virus vaccines reduced the incidence of AOM by 30% to 36%."
4973,Vaccines to prevent infections with RSV and PIV type 3 are undergoing clinical testing at this time.
4974,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and Moraxella catarrhalis are the three most common AOM pathogens."
4975,Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is effective in preventing invasive disease and AOM caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine.
4976,Vaccine candidates for NTHi and M. catarrhalis are under development.
4977," Background In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally."
4978,We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys.
4979,Methods The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with β-propiolactone.
4980,"Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine."
4981,"The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting."
4982,"We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control."
4983,Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test.
4984,The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy.
4985,"Additionally, three groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized with different doses of the purified inactivated SARS vaccine (0.5, 1 and 2μg/time/monkey) on days 0 and 7, and the monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain."
4986,We assessed the safety of the SARS vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred under low levels of neutralizing antibody in rhesus.
4987,Findings The purity of SARS vaccine was 97.6% by HPLC identification and reacted with convalescent sera of SARS patients.
4988,The purified SARS vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the replication of SARS-CoV in monkeys.
4989,"Under low levels of neutralizing antibody, no exacerbation of clinical symptoms was observed when the immunized monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV."
4990,"In this preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified SARS vaccine either at normal or large doses."
4991,"Interpretation The purified inactivated SARS vaccine could induce high levels of neutralizing antibody, and protect the monkeys from the challenge of SARS-CoV."
4992,The SARS vaccine prepared in the study appeared to be safe in monkeys.
4993, Continued improvements in vaccination technologies have led to remarkable progress in the control of human infectious diseases.
4994,"Our fundamental view of the nature of a vaccine was changed with the discovery of DNA immunization in the early 1990s when it was determined that the genetic material that encodes for antigens, rather than the actual antigens themselves, can be effective in eliciting an immune response."
4995,"Given the ever increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes, the opportunities that DNA vaccine technology provides could not have come at a more critical time in history."
4996,"Since its inception, DNA vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed."
4997,"Improved modes of administration, the use of codon and antigen gene optimization, and the implementation of vaccination DNA prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of DNA vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials."
4998,"Significant progress has been made in developing DNA vaccines against various biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets, such as HIV-1, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola, the viral encephalitides, anthrax, plague, and botulism, among others with some already moving into early phase clinical trials with promising results."
4999,Having the ability to respond to a potential bioterrorism threat or to some other emerging infectious disease outbreak is crucial and the advancements associated with DNA vaccination technology will allow us to do so in a prompt and rational matter.
5000,This article summarizes the state of the art in vaccine research against parasitic helminths in sheep and cattle.
5001,"Optimization of antigen production (eg, recombinant expression) and antigen delivery, followed by extensive field testing, is still required for further development of vaccines."
5002,Helminth vaccines should sufficiently reduce parasite transmission to protect vaccinated animals against parasite-induced disorders and production loss.
5003,"Vaccine efficacy requirements depend on the parasite’s epidemiology and farm management, both of which vary in different geographic regions and are influenced by climate."
5004,"Vaccination is likely to be part of integrated worm control, together with other worm control measures."
5005, Live vaccines are widely used in the avian industry.
5006,Such vaccines can be either injected or delivered on animal mucosa and are usually not adjuvanted.
5007,In this study we show that live vaccines efficacy can be improved by formulation with adjuvants in a model of mucosal delivery of live infectious bronchitis vaccine in chicken.
5008,Three adjuvant technologies have been tested using intranasal and spray delivery methods to poultry.
5009,"Those technologies are water in oil in water emulsion, nanoparticles and polymer adjuvants."
5010,Intranasal delivery of polymer and nanoparticles adjuvanted live vaccines improved significantly the antibody titer and protection to challenge observed compared to a commercial non-adjuvanted reference.
5011,"Moreover, spray delivery of the polymer adjuvanted vaccine showed a significantly higher protection compared to the non-adjuvanted reference."
5012,Our data demonstrates that the use of MontanideTM adjuvants in the formulation of live poultry vaccines for mucosal delivery can confer to vaccinated animals a significantly improved protection against pathogens.
5013,"Despite the availability of an inactivated vaccine that has been licensed for >50 years, the influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide."
5014,Constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the emergence of new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains.
5015,"Thus, there is a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines."
5016,"Recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity."
5017,"In addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection."
5018,"Moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses."
5019,"This review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans, comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines."
5020,"Despite the fact that there had been multiple small outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease, when a large outbreak occurred in 2014 there were no vaccines or drugs available for use."
5021,Clinical development of multiple candidate vaccines was then initiated in parallel with attempts to contain the outbreak but only one vaccine was eventually tested in a phase III trial.
5022,"In order to be better prepared for future outbreaks of known human pathogens, platform technologies to accelerate vaccine development should be employed, allowing vaccine developers to take advantage of detailed knowledge of the vaccine platform and facilitating rapid progress to clinical trials and eventually to vaccine stockpiles."
5023,"This review gives an example of one such vaccine platform, replication-deficient simian adenoviruses, and describes progress in human and livestock vaccine development for three outbreak pathogens, Ebola virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus."
5024,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an economically important enteric coronavirus, with over a 90% mortality rate in neonatal piglets."
5025,"The virus emerged in the US in 2013, resulting in severe production losses."
5026,Effective vaccine development against PEDV is a challenge.
5027,Inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy.
5028,"Attenuated vaccines, while more effective, require a relatively long lead development time, are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks."
5029,"To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities."
5030,We expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model.
5031,"Following the heat and RNAse treatment, PEDV virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells, indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro."
5032,Strong PEDV spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets.
5033,"Upon challenge, all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology, while the unvaccinated controls were not."
5034,The vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge; nor did they develop intestinal lesions.
5035,"Thus, the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for PEDV immunization."
5036," In May 2009, WHO convened a meeting of Working Group on Technical Specifications for Manufacturing and Evaluating Yellow Fever (YF) Vaccines, Geneva, Switzerland to initiate revision of the WHO Recommendations (formerly, Requirements) for YF vaccine published in WHO Technical Report Series number 872 (1998)."
5037,"The Working Group, consisting of experts from academia, industry, national regulatory authorities and national control laboratories, reviewed the latest issues of safety, efficacy and quality of YF vaccines and agreed that (i) the revision should focus on live attenuated YF vaccine virus 17D lineage; and that (ii) nonclinical and clinical guidelines for new vaccines prepared from 17D lineage be developed."
5038," A double-inactivated, candidate whole virus vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was developed and manufactured at large scale using fermenter cultures of serum protein free Vero cells."
5039,A two step inactivation procedure involving sequential formaldehyde and U.V.
5040,inactivation was utilised in order to ensure an extremely high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity.
5041,The immunogenicity of this double-inactivated vaccine was characterised in the mouse model.
5042,Mice that were immunised twice with the candidate SARS-CoV vaccine developed high antibody titres against the SARS-CoV spike protein and high levels of neutralising antibodies.
5043,The use of the adjuvant Al(OH)3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine.
5044,"In addition, cell mediated immunity as measured by interferon-γ and interleukin-4 stimulation, was elicited by vaccination."
5045,"Moreover, the vaccine confers protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV."
5046,Protection of mice was correlated to antibody titre against the SARS-CoV S protein and neutralising antibody titre.
5047,The immunogenicity and efficacy of β-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV (WI-SARS) vaccine was evaluated in BALB/c mice and golden Syrian hamsters.
5048,The vaccine preparation was tested with or without adjuvants.
5049,Adjuvant Systems AS01(B) and AS03(A) were selected and tested for their capacity to elicit high humoral and cellular immune responses to WI-SARS vaccine.
5050,"We evaluated the effect of vaccine dose and each adjuvant on immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, and the effect of vaccine dose with or without the AS01(B) adjuvant on the immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters."
5051,Efficacy was evaluated by challenge with wild-type virus at early and late time points (4 and 18 wk post-vaccination).
5052,"A single dose of vaccine with or without adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice; a second dose resulted in a significant boost in antibody levels, even in the absence of adjuvant."
5053,"The use of adjuvants resulted in higher antibody titers, with the AS01(B)-adjuvanted vaccine being slightly more immunogenic than the AS03(A)-adjuvanted vaccine."
5054,Two doses of WI-SARS with and without Adjuvant Systems were highly efficacious in mice.
5055,"In hamsters, two doses of WI-SARS with and without AS01(B) were immunogenic, and two doses of 2 μg of WI-SARS with and without the adjuvant provided complete protection from early challenge."
5056,"Although antibody titers had declined in all groups of vaccinated hamsters 18 wk after the second dose, the vaccinated hamsters were still partially protected from wild-type virus challenge."
5057,Vaccine with adjuvant provided better protection than non-adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine at this later time point.
5058,"Enhanced disease was not observed in the lungs or liver of hamsters following SARS-CoV challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies."

5060,Vaccination is a critical component of cattle health management.
5061,"Effective cattle vaccine programs should consider the timing of vaccination in relation to expected disease challenge, risk for wild-type exposure of various bovine pathogens, and host factors during vaccination."
5062,"Nearly all consulting veterinarians recommend vaccination of stressed, high-risk calves on feedlot arrival."
5063,"However, this recommendation fails to consider several factors associated with vaccine efficiency."
5064,Further research evaluating vaccine interactions in stressed cattle and potential additive effects of endotoxin from multiple bacterin administration may reveal new evidence-based vaccination guidelines for cattle in the various segments of beef and dairy production systems.
5065,"The traditional design of effective vaccines for rapidly-evolving pathogens, such as influenza A virus, has failed to provide broad spectrum and long-lasting protection."
5066,"With low cost whole genome sequencing technology and powerful computing capabilities, novel computational approaches have demonstrated the potential to facilitate the design of a universal influenza vaccine."
5067,"However, few studies have integrated computational optimization in the design and discovery of new vaccines."
5068,Understanding the potential of computational vaccine design is necessary before these approaches can be implemented on a broad scale.
5069,"This review summarizes some promising computational approaches under current development, including computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens with consensus sequences, phylogenetic model-based ancestral sequence reconstruction, and immunomics to compute conserved cross-reactive T-cell epitopes."
5070,Interactions between virus-host-environment determine the evolvability of the influenza population.
5071,"We propose that with the development of novel technologies that allow the integration of data sources such as protein structural modeling, host antibody repertoire analysis and advanced phylodynamic modeling, computational approaches will be crucial for the development of a long-lasting universal influenza vaccine."
5072,"Taken together, computational approaches are powerful and promising tools for the development of a universal influenza vaccine with durable and broad protection."
5073, Veterinary vaccines currently available in Europe and in other parts of the world are developed by the veterinary pharmaceutical industry.
5074,The development of a vaccine for veterinary use is an economic endeavour that takes many years.
5075,There are many obstacles along the path to the successful development and launch of a vaccine.
5076,The industrial development of a vaccine for veterinary use usually starts after the proof of concept that is based on robust academic research.
5077,A vaccine can only be made available to the veterinary community once marketing authorisation has been granted by the veterinary authorities.
5078,This review gives a brief description of the regulatory requirements which have to be fulfilled before a vaccine can be admitted to the market.
5079,Vaccines have to be produced in a quality controlled environment to guarantee delivery of a product of consistent quality with well defined animal and consumer safety and efficacy characteristics.
5080,"The regulatory and manufacturing legislative framework in which the development takes place is described, as well as the trend in developments in production systems."
5081,"Recent developments in bacterial, viral and parasite vaccine research and development are also addressed and the development of novel adjuvants that use the expanding knowledge of immunology and disease pathology are described."
5082,"The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV), and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the most pathogenic viruses known to man and the causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Africa with case fatality rates of up to 90%."
5083,"Nearly 30,000 infections were observed in the latest EBOV epidemic in West Africa; previous outbreaks were much smaller, typically only affecting less than a few hundred people."
5084,"Compared to other diseases such as AIDS or Malaria with millions of cases annually, filovirus hemorrhagic fever (FHF) is one of the neglected infectious diseases."
5085,"There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to treat EBOV and MARV infections; therefore, these pathogens can only be handled in maximum containment laboratories and are classified as select agents."
5086,"Under these limitations, a very few laboratories worldwide conducted basic research and countermeasure development for EBOV and MARV since their respective discoveries in 1967 (MARV) and 1976 (EBOV)."
5087,"In this review, we discuss several vaccine platforms against EBOV and MARV, which have been assessed for their protective efficacy in animal models of FHF."
5088,"The focus is on the most promising approaches, which were accelerated in clinical development (phase I–III trials) during the EBOV epidemic in West Africa."
5089,Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is an emerging infectious disease caused by an alphavirus transmitted by Aedes spp.
5090,mosquitoes.
5091,"Because mosquito control programs are not highly efficient for outbreak containment, vaccines are essential to reduce the burden of disease."
5092,"Although no licensed vaccine against CHIKF is yet available, many highly promising candidates are undergoing preclinical studies, and a few of them have been tested in human trials of phase 1 or 2."
5093,"Here, we review recent findings regarding the need for a CHIKF vaccine and provide an update on vaccines nearing or having entered clinical trials."
5094,"We also address needs to tackle bottlenecks to vaccine development—including scientific and financial barriers—and to accelerate the development of vaccines; several actions should be taken: (i) design efficacy trials to be conducted during the course of outbreaks; (ii) evaluate the opportunity for adopting the “animal rule”for demonstration of efficacy for regulatory purposes; (iii) strengthen the collective commitment of nations, international organizations, potential donors and industry; (iv) stimulate public and/or private partnerships to invest in vaccine development and licensure; and (v) identify potential markets for an effective and safe CHIKF vaccine."
5095,Vaccination is the mainstay of preventative medicine for many infectious diseases.
5096,"Pregnant women, unborn fetuses, and neonates represent three at-risk populations that can be simultaneously protected by strategic vaccination protocols."
5097,"Because the pathogenesis of different infectious microbes varies based on tissue tropism, timing of infection, and host susceptibility, the goals of immunization are not uniform across all vaccines."
5098,"Mechanistic understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis and immune responses is therefore essential to inform vaccine design and the implementation of appropriate immunization protocols that optimize protection of pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates."
5099,"We have previously developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) that induce humoral immunity against each virus and confer protection from both lethal RABV and mouse-adapted EBOV challenge in mice."
5100,"Here, we expand our investigation of the immunogenic properties of these bivalent vaccines in mice."
5101,Both live and killed vaccines induced primary EBOV GP-specific T-cells and a robust recall response as measured by interferon-γ ELISPOT assay.
5102,"In addition to cellular immunity, an effective filovirus vaccine will likely require a multivalent humoral immune response against multiple virus species."
5103,"As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated that inactivated RV-GP could be formulated with another inactivated RABV vaccine expressing the nontoxic fragment of botulinum neurotoxin A heavy chain (HC50) without a reduction in immunity to each component."
5104,"Finally, we demonstrated that humoral immunity to GP could be induced by immunization of mice with inactivated RV-GP in the presence of pre-existing immunity to RABV."
5105,The ability of these novel vaccines to induce strong humoral and cellular immunity indicates that they should be further evaluated in additional animal models of infection.
5106, Purpose The field of HIV-1 vaccinology has evolved during the last 30 years from the first viral vector HIV gene insert constructs to vaccination regimens using a myriad of strategies.
5107,"These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design."
5108,This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward.
5109,"Methods We conducted a search of 2 electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, for experimental studies that involved new HIV immunogen designs between 2013 and 2019."
5110,"During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they were written in language other than English and/or were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation."
5111,We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies.
5112,Findings The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth during the last 3 decades.
5113,Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system.
5114,"As a result, several new rationally designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last 6 years, including native-like envelope trimers, nanoparticle, and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others."
5115,Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials.
5116,Implications Rapid developments in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies suggest that a tolerable and effective HIV vaccine may be on the horizon.
5117,Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has spread to more than 70 countries worldwide since 2015.
5118,"Despite active research, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics."
5119,"We have previously reported the development of various adenoviral vectored vaccine candidates (ChAdOx1 ZIKV) with the ability to stimulate effective immunity in mice and provide protection upon a ZIKV challenge model, using a non-adjuvanted single vaccination approach."
5120,"In this study, we constructed various modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viruses to express the ZIKV Envelope (E) with modifications on the precursor membrane (prM) or on the C-terminus envelope transmembrane domain (TM), similar to our ChAdOx1 vaccine candidates."
5121,"MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates were evaluated as a non-adjuvanted single vaccination regimen against a ZIKV Brazilian isolate, using viraemia as the correlate of protection."
5122,"Here, we report the induction of a modest level of anti-ZIKV E antibodies by all MVA vectored vaccines and sub-optimal efficacy in a ZIKV challenge model."
5123,Our results indicate the requirement of additional strategies when using MVA-ZIKV vaccines to afford sterile protection upon a non-adjuvanted and single vaccination regime.
5124,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the role of adjuvants in eliciting desirable antibody responses against HIV-1 with particular emphasis on both historical context and recent developments.
5125,RECENT FINDINGS: Increased understanding of the role of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors in recruiting and directing the immune system has increased the variety of adjuvant formulations being tested in animal models and humans.
5126,"Across all vaccine platforms, adjuvant formulations have been shown to enhance desirable immune responses such as higher antibody titers and increased functional activity."
5127,"Although no vaccine formulation has yet succeeded in eliciting broad neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, the ability of adjuvants to direct the immune response to immunogens suggests they will be critically important in any successful HIV-1 vaccine."
5128,SUMMARY: The parallel development of adjuvants along with better HIV-1 immunogens will be needed for a successful AIDS vaccine.
5129,Additional comparative testing will be required to determine the optimal adjuvant and immunogen regimen that can elicit antibody responses capable of blocking HIV-1 transmission.
5130,Infectious diseases know no borders: A plea for more collaboration between researchers in human and veterinary vaccines
5131,"In the history of vaccine development, the synthetic vaccine is a milestone that is in stark contrast with traditional vaccines based on live-attenuated or inactivated microorganisms."
5132,Synthetic vaccines not only are safer than attenuated or inactivated microorganisms but also provide the opportunity for vaccine design for specific purposes.
5133,The first generation of synthetic vaccines has been largely based on DNA recombination technology and genetic manipulation.
5134,"This de novo generation is occasionally time consuming and costly, especially in the era of genomics and when facing pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases."
5135,"To accelerate and simplify the R&D process for vaccines, we developed an improved method of synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly."
5136,We optimized and employed the recently developed SpyTag/SpyCatcher technique to establish a protein assembly system for vaccine generation from pre-prepared subunit proteins.
5137,"As proof of principle, we chose a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting molecule and specific model antigens to generate desired vaccines."
5138,The results demonstrated that a new vaccine generated in this way does not hamper the individual function of different vaccine components and is efficient in inducing both T and B cell responses.
5139,This protein assembly strategy may be especially useful for high-throughput antigen screening or rapid vaccine generation.
5140," Dual-subtype feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vaccine, consisting of inaactivated cells infected with subtypes A (Petaluma strain) and D (Shizuoka strain), was developed and tested for its vaccine efficacy against FIV infection in specific pathogen free (SPF) cats."
5141,Animals were monitored for proviral DNA by FIV-specific PCR and for FIV-specific antibody profiles by ELISA and virus-neutralization assays.
5142,"In addition, blood from challenged cats was inoculated into naive SPF cats to confirm the viral status of the vaccinated cats."
5143,"All cats immunized with Petaluma vaccine alone were protected against homologous Petaluma challenge, but only one of four cats was protected against heterologous Shizuoka challenge."
5144,"More importantly, all cats immunized with the dual-subtype vaccine were protected against both Petaluma and Shizuoka challenges."
5145,These results suggest that a multi-subtype vaccine approach may provide the broad-spectrum immunity necessary for vaccine protection against strains from different subtypes.
5146,"The filoviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus, cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate in humans and nonhuman primates."
5147,Among the most-promising filovirus vaccines under development is a system based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) that expresses a single filovirus glycoprotein (GP) in place of the VSV glycoprotein (G).
5148,"Importantly, a single injection of blended rVSV-based filovirus vaccines was shown to completely protect nonhuman primates against Marburg virus and 3 different species of Ebola virus."
5149,"These rVSV-based vaccines have also shown utility when administered as a postexposure treatment against filovirus infections, and a rVSV-based Ebola virus vaccine was recently used to treat a potential laboratory exposure."
5150,"Here, we review the history of rVSV-based vaccines and pivotal animal studies showing their utility in combating Ebola and Marburg virus infections."
5151,Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Asia and associated human infections have led to a heightened level of awareness and preparation for a possible influenza pandemic.
5152,Vaccination is the best option by which spread of a pandemic virus could be prevented and severity of disease reduced.
5153,"Production of live attenuated and inactivated vaccine seed viruses against avian influenza viruses, which have the potential to cause pandemics, and their testing in preclinical studies and clinical trials will establish the principles and ensure manufacturing experience that will be critical in the event of the emergence of such a virus into the human population."
5154,Studies of such vaccines will also add to our understanding of the biology of avian influenza viruses and their behavior in mammalian hosts.
5155,"One of the main public health concerns of emerging viruses is their potential introduction into and sustained circulation among populations of immunologically naïve, susceptible hosts."
5156,The induction of protective immunity through vaccination can be a powerful tool to prevent this concern by conferring protection to the population at risk.
5157,"Conventional approaches to develop vaccines against emerging pathogens have significant limitations: lack of experimental tools for several emerging viruses of concern, poor immunogenicity, safety issues, or lack of cross-protection against antigenic variants."
5158,"The unpredictability of the emergence of future virus threats demands the capability to rapidly develop safe, effective vaccines."
5159,"We describe some recent advances in new vaccine strategies that are being explored as alternatives to classical attenuated and inactivated vaccines, and provide examples of potential novel vaccines for emerging viruses."
5160,These approaches might be applied to the control of many other emerging pathogens.
5161,Lassa virus (LASV) is a rodent-borne arenavirus endemic to several West African countries that causes Lassa fever (LF).
5162,LF is typically mild but it can cause severe disease characterized by hemorrhagic fever and multi-organ failure.
5163,A current outbreak of LASV in Nigeria has seen greater than 300 cases with a case fatality rate of 22%.
5164,"Currently, there are limited treatment options and no vaccine candidates are approved to prevent LASV infection."
5165,The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has identified LASV as an emerging pathogen of high consequence and this has resulted in a push for several preclinical vaccine candidates to be advanced toward clinical trials.
5166,"Here, we discuss several important aspects of LASV infection including immunobiology, immune evasion, and correlates of protection against LF, which have been identified through animal models and human infections."
5167,"In addition, we discuss several vaccine candidates that have shown efficacy in animal models that could be advanced toward clinical trials."
5168,The increased fatality rate seen in the recent LASV outbreak in Nigeria highlights the importance of developing effective treatment and prevention strategies against LF.
5169,"The spike in LASV cases seen in West Africa has the potential for increased mortality and human-to-human transmission, making the development and testing of effective vaccines for LASV critical."
5170,: Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever syndrome that is associated with high mortality in humans.
5171,"In the absence of effective therapies for Ebola virus infection, the development of a vaccine becomes an important strategy to contain outbreaks."
5172,Immunization with DNA and/or replication-defective adenoviral vectors (rAd) encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) has been previously shown to confer specific protective immunity in nonhuman primates.
5173,"GP can exert cytopathic effects on transfected cells in vitro, and multiple GP forms have been identified in nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine."
5174,"METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we have explored the efficacy of mutant GPs from multiple Ebola virus strains with reduced in vitro cytopathicity and analyzed their protective effects in the primate challenge model, with or without NP."
5175,Deletion of the GP transmembrane domain eliminated in vitro cytopathicity but reduced its protective efficacy by at least one order of magnitude.
5176,"In contrast, a point mutation was identified that abolished this cytopathicity but retained immunogenicity and conferred immune protection in the absence of NP."
5177,"The minimal effective rAd dose was established at 10(10) particles, two logs lower than that used previously."
5178,CONCLUSIONS: Expression of specific GPs alone vectored by rAd are sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge in a relevant nonhuman primate model.
5179,"Elimination of NP from the vaccine and dose reductions to 10(10) rAd particles do not diminish protection and simplify the vaccine, providing the basis for selection of a human vaccine candidate."
5180,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute, high-mortality-rate, severe infectious disease caused by an emerging MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that causes severe respiratory diseases."
5181,The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines.
5182,We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies.
5183,We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV.
5184,"In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses."
5185,The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector.
5186,"However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 µg."
5187,These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model.
5188,"This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens."
5189,Chapter 51 Respiratory Viral Vaccines
5190,"Veterinary vaccines need to have desired characteristics, such as being effective, inexpensive, easy to administer, suitable for mass vaccination and stable under field conditions."
5191,DNA vaccines have been proposed as potential solutions for poultry diseases since they are subunit vaccines with no risk of infection or reversion to virulence.
5192,DNA vaccines can be utilized for simultaneous immunizations against multiple pathogens and are relatively easy to design and inexpensive to manufacture and store.
5193,Administration of DNA vaccines has been shown to stimulate immune responses and provide protection from challenges in different animal models.
5194,"Although DNA vaccines offer advantages, setbacks including the inability to induce strong immunity, and the fact that they are not currently applicable for mass vaccination impede the use of DNA vaccines in the poultry industry."
5195,The use of either biological or physical carriers has been proposed as a solution to overcome the current delivery limitations of DNA vaccines for veterinary applications.
5196,This review presents an overview of the recent development of carriers for delivery of veterinary DNA vaccines against avian pathogens.
5197, Recent studies have established the feasibility of subunit-based experimental vaccines to protect animals from lethal poxvirus infection.
5198,"Individual outer membrane proteins from intracellular and extracellular virions of vaccinia virus, when delivered in the form of either DNA vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines produced from baculovirus-infected insect cells, were able to protect mice from the vaccinia virus challenge and rhesus macaques from the monkeypox virus challenge."
5199,"The polyvalent formulations with various combinations of the four poxvirus antigens (A27, L1, B5 and A33) achieved better protection than the monovalent formulation using only one of these antigens."
5200,"However, it is not clear whether any of the remaining outer membrane poxvirus proteins can further improve the efficacy of the current polyvalent formulations."
5201,"In this study, we conducted detailed analysis on the immunogenicity of D8, a previously reported protective antigen from intracellular mature virions."
5202,Our results indicated that D8 induced strong protective antibody responses and was effective in improving the efficacy of previously reported polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations.
5203,"Therefore, D8 is an excellent candidate antigen to be included in the final polyvalent subunit-based poxvirus vaccines."
5204," We have investigated to develop novel vaccines against SARS CoV using cDNA constructs encoding the structural antigen; spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), or nucleocapsid (N) protein, derived from SARS CoV."
5205,"Mice vaccinated with SARS-N or -M DNA using pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid vector showed T cell immune responses (CTL induction and proliferation) against N or M protein, respectively."
5206,"CTL responses were also detected to SARS DNA-transfected type II alveolar epithelial cells (T7 cell clone), which are thought to be initial target cells for SARS virus infection in human."
5207,"To determine whether these DNA vaccines could induce T cell immune responses in humans as well as in mice, SCID-PBL/hu mice was immunized with these DNA vaccines."
5208,"As expected, virus-specific CTL responses and T cell proliferation were induced from human T cells."
5209,SARS-N and SARS-M DNA vaccines and SCID-PBL/hu mouse model will be important in the development of protective vaccines.
5210,62 The development of gene-based vectors for immunization
5211,The use of a DNA immunization approach to deliver protective antigens against Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) has been successful in previously reported studies.
5212,"In the current study, the gene designs for V and F1, two well-studied virulent factors serving as main targets for vaccine development, were altered to explore additional options in hopes of improving the protective immunity of DNA vaccines expressing these two antigens."
5213,"Compared to the wild type V gene DNA vaccines, the use of codon optimized V gene sequences was effective in improving the antigen expression, titers of anti-V antibody responses, and survival against a mucosal lethal challenge."
5214,"For the F1 DNA vaccine, removal of the N-terminal hydrophobic region was able to improve protective immunity."
5215,"However, adding a mammalian signal peptide sequence to F1 actually led to reduced protection despite it inducing slightly higher anti-F1 antibody responses."
5216,"The F1 gene can be fused with a gene coding for YscF, a newly confirmed partial protective antigen for Y. pestis, to produce DNA vaccines that express fused F1 and YscF antigens."
5217,"One design, in particular, that had YscF fused to the downstream sequence of F1, produced better protection than separate F1 or YscF DNA vaccines, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these two antigens."
5218,Findings from the above studies indicated that there are multiple approaches to optimize the protective immunity for plague DNA vaccines.
5219,"Most importantly, proper antigen engineering to produce optimal antigen gene inserts in DNA vaccines can clearly play a major role in the future designs of a wide range of DNA vaccines."
5220,The employment of live attenuated vaccines has a long-standing record in human and veterinary medicine.
5221,Most of the vaccines in current use were empirically developed during the last century.
5222,"Today, due to the great advances in fields such as immunology and bioengineering, the rational development of live attenuated vaccines becomes increasingly feasible."
5223,"Moreover, live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors."
5224,"In each case, the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity, antigen synthesis, antigen release, and safety aspects have to be integrated."
5225,"A range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics, but very few have been approved so far."
5226,"In many cases, further optimization of such vaccines is necessary with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles."
5227,"In the present chapter, we focus on current strategies which are employed for the development of new and the optimization of first generation recombinant live vaccines based on bacteria and viruses."
5228,Vaccination is the single most effective way to control viral diseases.
5229,"However, many currently used vaccines have safety concerns, efficacy issues or production problems."
5230,"For other viral pathogens, classic approaches to vaccine development have, thus far, been unsuccessful."
5231,Virus-like particles (VLPs) are increasingly being considered as vaccine candidates because they offer significant advantages over many currently used vaccines or developing vaccine technologies.
5232,"VLPs formed with structural proteins of Newcastle disease virus, an avian paramyxovirus, are a potential vaccine candidate for Newcastle disease in poultry."
5233,"More importantly, these VLPs are a novel, uniquely versatile VLP platform for the rapid construction of effective vaccine candidates for many human pathogens, including genetically complex viruses and viruses for which no vaccines currently exist."
5234, SARS-CoV was the cause of the global pandemic in 2003 that infected over 8000 people in 8 months.
5235,Vaccines against SARS are still not available.
5236,We developed a novel method to produce high levels of a recombinant SARS virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccine containing the SARS spike (S) protein and the influenza M1 protein using the baculovirus insect cell expression system.
5237,These chimeric SARS VLPs have a similar size and morphology to the wild type SARS-CoV.
5238,We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified chimeric SARS VLPs and full length SARS S protein vaccines in a mouse lethal challenge model.
5239,"The SARS VLP vaccine, containing 0.8μg of SARS S protein, completely protected mice from death when administered intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) routes in the absence of an adjuvant."
5240,"Likewise, the SARS VLP vaccine, containing 4μg of S protein without adjuvant, reduced lung virus titer to below detectable level, protected mice from weight loss, and elicited a high level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV."
5241,Sf9 cell-produced full length purified SARS S protein was also an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV but only when co-administered IM with aluminum hydroxide.
5242,SARS-CoV VLPs are highly immunogenic and induce neutralizing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge.
5243,Sf9 cell-based VLP vaccines are a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic agents.
5244,"Vaccine science has extended beyond genomics to proteomics and has come to also encompass ‘immunomics,’ the study of the universe of pathogen-derived or neoplasm-derived peptides that interface with B and T cells of the host immune system."
5245,"It has been theorized that effective vaccines can be developed using the minimum essential subset of T cell and B cell epitopes that comprise the ‘immunome.’ Researchers are therefore using bioinformatics sequence analysis tools, epitope-mapping tools, microarrays, and high-throughput immunology assays to discover the minimal essential components of the immunome."
5246,"When these minimal components, or epitopes, are packaged with adjuvants in an appropriate delivery vehicle, the complete package comprises an epitope-based immunome-derived vaccine."
5247,"Such vaccines may have a significant advantage over conventional vaccines, as the careful selection of the components may diminish undesired side effects such as have been observed with whole pathogen and protein subunit vaccines."
5248,This chapter will review the pre-clinical and anticipated clinical development of computer-driven vaccine design and the validation of epitope-based immunome-derived vaccines in animal models; it will also include an overview of heterologous immunity and other emerging issues that will need to be addressed by vaccines of all types in the future.
5249,The vast majority of human pathogens colonize and invade at the mucosal surfaces.
5250,Preventing infection at these sites via mucosally active vaccines is a promising and rational approach for vaccine development.
5251,"However, it is only recently that the stimulation of local immunity at the mucosal surfaces has become a primary objective in addition to inducing systemic immunity."
5252,"This review describes vaccine formulations designed for mucosal delivery to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, via intranasal administration."
5253,The association of antigens with mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems is emphasised.
5254,"Today, the main challenges for vaccinologists include improving vaccines against as yet undefeated pathogens, rapid identification and response to emerging diseases and successful intervention in chronic diseases in which ongoing immune responses are insufficient."
5255,Reverse genetics and reverse vaccinology are now used to generate rapidly new vaccine strains and to mine whole genomes in the search for promising antigens.
5256,The rational design of adjuvants has become possible as a result of the discovery of the receptors that recognize microbial patterns and lead to dendritic cell activation.
5257,"Antigen-loaded dendritic cells, DNA in naked, formulated or viral form, and other delivery systems are used to maximize immune responses."
5258,"Although work on the ‘easy’ vaccines has already been completed, it is hoped that a combination of conceptual and technical innovation will enable the development of more complex and sophisticated vaccines in the future."
5259," The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is an emerging pathogen that continues to cause outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula and in travelers from this region, raising the concern that a global pandemic could occur."
5260,"Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids (S1) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice."
5261,"With three immunizations, high titers of neutralizing antibodies (up to 1: 104) were generated without adjuvant."
5262,DNA vaccination with the MERS-CoV S1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ and other cytokines.
5263,Both pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcDNA3.1-S1 vaccinated mice protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice from MERS-CoV challenge.
5264,These results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine encoding MERS-CoV S1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against MERS-CoV infection.
5265, The immunogenicity of a candidate-inactivated vaccine prepared from SARS-CoV F69 strain was evaluated in Balb/c mice.
5266,"Potent humoral immune responses were induced under the elicitation of three times of immunizations at 2-week intervals with this vaccine, combined with three types of adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant, Al(OH)3 adjuvant and CpG adjuvant)."
5267,"Titers of specific IgG antibodies in three test groups all peaked in the sixth week after first vaccination, but significant differences existed in the kinetics of specific IgG antibody levels."
5268,The strong neutralizing capacity exhibited in micro-cytopathic effect neutralization tests indicated the specific antibodies are protective.
5269,Western blot assay further demonstrated the specificity of the induced serum antibodies.
5270,"The LC16m8 strain of vaccinia virus, the active ingredient in the Japanese smallpox vaccine, was derived from the Lister/Elstree strain."
5271,"LC16m8 is replication-competent and has been administered to over 100,000 infants and 3,000 adults with no serious adverse reactions."
5272,"Despite this outstanding safety profile, the occurrence of spontaneously-generated large plaque-forming virulent LC16m8 revertants following passage in cell culture is a major drawback."
5273,We identified the gene responsible for the reversion and deleted the gene (B5R) from LC16m8 to derive LC16m8Δ.
5274,"LC16m8∆ is non-pathogenic in immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, genetically-stable and does not reverse to a large-plaque phenotype upon passage in cell culture, even under conditions in which most LC16m8 populations are replaced by revertants."
5275,"Moreover, LC16m8∆ is >500-fold more effective than the non-replicating vaccinia virus (VV), Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), at inducing murine immune responses against pathogenic VV."
5276,"LC16m8∆, which expresses the SIV gag gene, also induced anti-Gag CD8(+) T-cells more efficiently than MVA and another non-replicating VV, Dairen I minute-pock variants (DIs)."
5277,"Moreover, LC16m8∆ expressing HIV-1 Env in combination with a Sendai virus vector induced the production of anti-Env antibodies and CD8(+) T-cells."
5278,"Thus, the safety and efficacy of LC16m8∆ mean that it represents an outstanding platform for the development of human vaccine vectors."
5279,"Alphavirus vectors have demonstrated high levels of transient heterologous gene expression both in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, possess attractive features for vaccine development."
5280,"The most commonly used delivery vectors are based on three single-stranded encapsulated alphaviruses, namely Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus."
5281,"Alphavirus vectors have been applied as replication-deficient recombinant viral particles and, more recently, as replication-proficient particles."
5282,"Moreover, in vitro transcribed RNA, as well as layered DNA vectors have been applied for immunization."
5283,A large number of highly immunogenic viral structural proteins expressed from alphavirus vectors have elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses in multispecies animal models.
5284,"Furthermore, immunization studies have demonstrated robust protection against challenges with lethal doses of virus in rodents and primates."
5285,"Similarly, vaccination with alphavirus vectors expressing tumor antigens resulted in prophylactic protection against challenges with tumor-inducing cancerous cells."
5286,"As certain alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus, have been associated with epidemics in animals and humans, attention has also been paid to the development of vaccines against alphaviruses themselves."
5287,Recent progress in alphavirus vector development and vaccine technology has allowed conducting clinical trials in humans.
5288,"Introduction: Influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are important human respiratory pathogens."
5289,Recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are suggested to be potential promising platforms to protect against these respiratory viruses.
5290,This review updates important progress in the development of VLP vaccines against respiratory viruses.
5291,"Areas Covered: This review summarizes progress in developing VLP and nanoparticle-based vaccines against influenza virus, RSV, and HMPV."
5292,The PubMed was mainly used to search for important research articles published since 2010 although earlier key articles were also referenced.
5293,"The research area covered includes VLP and nanoparticle platform vaccines against seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza viruses as well as RSV and HMPV respiratory viruses."
5294,"The production methods, immunogenic properties, and vaccine efficacy of respiratory VLP vaccines in preclinical animal models and clinical studies were reviewed in this article."
5295,Expert opinion: Previous and current preclinical and clinical studies suggest that recombinant VLP and nanoparticle vaccines are expected to be developed as promising alternative platforms against respiratory viruses in future.
5296,"Therefore, continued research efforts are warranted."
5297,The receptor-binding domains (RBDs) located in toxin A and toxin B of Clostridium difficile are known to be nontoxic and immunogenic.
5298,We need to develop a new type vaccine based on RBDs.
5299,"In this study, we expressed and purified recombinant proteins (named RBD-TcdA and RBD-TcdB) as vaccine candidates containing the RBDs of toxin A and toxin B, respectively, from the C. difficile reference strain VPI10463."
5300,"The immunogenicity and protection of the vaccine candidates RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, and RBD-TcdA/B was evaluated by ELISA and survival assays."
5301,The data indicated that mice immunized with all vaccine candidates displayed potent levels of RBD-specific serum IgG.
5302,"Following intramuscular immunization of mice with RBD-TcdA and/or RBD-TcdB, these vaccine candidates triggered immune responses that protected mice compared to mice immunized with aluminum hydroxide alone."
5303,"Taken together, the results of this study reveal that recombinant proteins containing RBDs of C. difficile toxins can be used for vaccine development."
5304,"Additionally, we found that an RBD-TcdA/B vaccine can elicit a stronger humoral immune response and provide better immunoprotection than the univalent vaccines."
5305,This RBD vaccine candidate conferred significant protection against disease symptoms and death caused by toxins from a wild-type C. difficile strain.
5306,Viral subunit vaccines often contain immunodominant non-neutralizing epitopes that divert host immune responses.
5307,"These epitopes should be eliminated in vaccine design, but there is no reliable method for evaluating an epitope's capacity to elicit neutralizing immune responses."
5308,Here we introduce a new concept ‘neutralizing immunogenicity index' (NII) to evaluate an epitope's neutralizing immunogenicity.
5309,"To determine the NII, we mask the epitope with a glycan probe and then assess the epitope's contribution to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity."
5310,"As proof-of-concept, we measure the NII for different epitopes on an immunogen comprised of the receptor-binding domain from MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
5311,"Further, we design a variant form of this vaccine by masking an epitope that has a negative NII score."
5312,This engineered vaccine demonstrates significantly enhanced efficacy in protecting transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge.
5313,Our study may guide the rational design of highly effective subunit vaccines to combat MERS-CoV and other life-threatening viruses.
5314,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases as well as cancer pose great global health impacts on the society.
5315,Vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases.
5316,This is achieved by means of activating various components of the immune system to generate systemic inflammatory reactions targeting infectious agents or diseased cells for control/elimination.
5317,"DNA virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of DNA manipulation technologies, which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules."
5318,"Despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years, many hurdles still remain for achieving the full clinical potential of viral-vectored vaccines."
5319,This chapter will present the evolution of vaccines from “live” or “attenuated” first-generation agents to recombinant DNA and viral-vectored vaccines.
5320,Particular emphasis will be given to human adenovirus (Ad) for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.
5321,Ad biological properties related to vaccine development will be highlighted along with their advantages and potential hurdles to be overcome.
5322,"In particular, we will discuss (1) genetic modifications in the Ad capsid protein to reduce the intrinsic viral immunogenicity, (2) antigen capsid incorporation for effective presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system, (3) modification of the hexon and fiber capsid proteins for Ad liver de-targeting and selective retargeting to cancer cells, (4) Ad-based vaccines carrying “arming” transgenes with immunostimulatory functions as immune adjuvants, and (5) oncolytic Ad vectors as a new therapeutic approach against cancer."
5323,"Finally, the combination of adenoviral vectors with other non-adenoviral vector systems, the prime/boost strategy of immunization, clinical trials involving Ad-based vaccines, and the perspectives for the field development will be discussed."
5324, The baculovirus–insect cell expression system is an approved system for the production of viral antigens with vaccine potential for humans and animals and has been used for production of subunit vaccines against parasitic diseases as well.
5325,Many candidate subunit vaccines have been expressed in this system and immunization commonly led to protective immunity against pathogen challenge.
5326,The first vaccines produced in insect cells for animal use are now on the market.
5327,"This chapter deals with the tailoring of the baculovirus–insect cell expression system for vaccine production in terms of expression levels, integrity and immunogenicity of recombinant proteins, and baculovirus genome stability."
5328,"Various expression strategies are discussed including chimeric, virus‐like particles, baculovirus display of foreign antigens on budded virions or in occlusion bodies, and specialized baculovirus vectors with mammalian promoters that express the antigen in the immunized individual."
5329,A historical overview shows the wide variety of viral (glyco)proteins that have successfully been expressed in this system for vaccine purposes.
5330,The potential of this expression system for antiparasite vaccines is illustrated.
5331,"The combination of subunit vaccines and marker tests, both based on antigens expressed in insect cells, provides a powerful tool to combat disease and to monitor infectious agents."
5332,"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a secretory inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, plays a critical role in certain bone loss diseases."
5333,"Studies have shown that serum levels of DKK1 are significantly higher in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and are correlated with the severity of the disease, which indicates the possibility that bone erosion in RA may be inhibited by neutralizing the biological activity of DKK1."
5334,"In this study, we selected a panel of twelve peptides using the software DNASTAR 7.1 and screened high affinity and immunogenicity epitopes in vitro and in vivo assays."
5335,"Furthermore, we optimized four B cell epitopes to design a novel DKK1 multiepitope DNA vaccine and evaluated its bone protective effects in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of RA."
5336,High level expression of the designed vaccine was measured in supernatant of COS7 cells.
5337,"In addition, intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with this vaccine was also highly expressed and sufficient to induce the production of long-term IgG, which neutralized natural DKK1 in vivo."
5338,"Importantly, this vaccine significantly attenuated bone erosion in CIA mice compared with positive control mice."
5339,These results provide evidence for the development of a DNA vaccine targeted against DKK1 to attenuate bone erosion.
5340,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new member in the lineage C of β-coronavirus (β-CoV)."
5341,The increased human cases and high mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines.
5342,"In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed."
5343,How to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed.
5344,"Overall, these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future."
5345,"Developing vaccines to biothreat agents presents a number of challenges for discovery, preclinical development, and licensure."
5346,"The need for high containment to work with live agents limits the amount and types of research that can be done using complete pathogens, and small markets reduce potential returns for industry."
5347,"However, a number of tools, from comparative pathogenesis of viral strains at the molecular level to novel computational approaches, are being used to understand the basis of viral attenuation and characterize protective immune responses."
5348,"As the amount of basic molecular knowledge grows, we will be able to take advantage of these tools not only to rationally attenuate virus strains for candidate vaccines, but also to assess immunogenicity and safety in silico."
5349,"This review discusses how a basic understanding of pathogenesis, allied with systems biology and machine learning methods, can impact biodefense vaccinology."
5350,Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used more extensively for human immunization than any other vaccine.
5351,"For almost two centuries, VACV was employed to provide cross-protection against variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, until the disease was eradicated in the late 1970s."
5352,"Since that time, continued research on VACV has produced a number of modified vaccines with improved safety profiles."
5353,"Attenuation has been achieved through several strategies, including sequential passage in an alternative host, deletion of specific genes or genetic engineering of viral genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins."
5354,Some highly attenuated third- and fourth-generation VACV vaccines are now being considered for stockpiling against a possible re-introduction of smallpox through bioterrorism.
5355,"Researchers have also taken advantage of the ability of the VACV genome to accommodate additional genetic material to produce novel vaccines against a wide variety of infectious agents, including a recombinant VACV encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein that is administered orally to wild animals."
5356,"This review provides an in-depth examination of these successive generations of VACV vaccines, focusing on how the understanding of poxviral replication and viral gene function permits the deliberate modification of VACV immunogenicity and virulence."
5357,Several studies have shown a reduced efficacy of influenza vaccines in the elderly compared to young adults.
5358,"In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a commercially available inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone(®)) in young adult and aged mice."
5359,C57/BL6 mice were administered a single or double immunization of Fluzone(®) with or without CpG and challenged intranasally with H1N1 A/California/09 virus.
5360,"A double immunization of Fluzone(®) adjuvanted with CpG elicited the highest level of protection in young adult mice which was associated with increases in influenza specific IgG, elevated HAI titres, reduced viral titres and lung inflammation."
5361,"In contrast, the vaccine schedule which provided fully protective immunity in young adult mice conferred limited protection in aged mice."
5362,Antigen presenting cells from aged mice were found to be less responsive to in vitro stimulation by Fluzone and CpG which may partially explain this result.
5363,Our data are supportive of studies that have shown limited effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the elderly and provide important information relevant to the design of more immunogenic vaccines in this age group.
5364, Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a major role in the immune response as a soluble pattern-recognition receptor.
5365,MBL deficiency and susceptibility to different types of infections have been subject to extensive studies over the last decades.
5366,"In humans and chickens, several studies have shown that MBL participates in the protection of hosts against virus infections."
5367,Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of economic importance in the poultry industry caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).
5368,"MBL has earlier been described to play a potential role in the pathogenesis of IBV infection and the production of IBV-specific antibodies, which may be exploited in optimising IBV vaccine strategies."
5369,The present study shows that MBL has the capability to bind to IBV in vitro.
5370,"Chickens from two inbred lines (L10H and L10L) selected for high or low MBL serum concentrations, respectively, were vaccinated against IBV with or without the addition of the MBL ligands mannan, chitosan and fructooligosaccharide (FOS)."
5371,"The addition of MBL ligands to the IBV vaccine, especially FOS, enhanced the production of IBV-specific IgG antibody production in L10H chickens, but not L10L chickens after the second vaccination."
5372,The addition of FOS to the vaccine also increased the number of circulating CD4+ cells in L10H chickens compared to L10L chickens.
5373,"The L10H chickens as well as the L10L chickens also showed an increased number of CD4−CD8α−γδ T-cells when an MBL ligand was added to the vaccine, most pronouncedly after the first vaccination."
5374,"As MBL ligands co-administered with IBV vaccine induced differences between the two chicken lines, these results indirectly suggest that MBL is involved in the immune response to IBV vaccination."
5375,"Furthermore, the higher antibody response in L10H chickens receiving vaccine and FOS makes FOS a potential adjuvant candidate in an IBV vaccine."
5376,Influenza viruses have a huge impact on public health.
5377,Current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually and protect poorly against antigenic drift variants or novel emerging subtypes.
5378,"Vaccination against influenza can be improved in two important ways, either by inducing more broadly protective immune responses or by decreasing the time of vaccine production, which is relevant especially during a pandemic outbreak."
5379,"In this review, we outline the current efforts to develop so-called “universal influenza vaccines”, describing antigens that may induce broadly protective immunity and novel vaccine production platforms that facilitate timely availability of vaccines."
5380,Background.
5381,The emergence and global spread of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus have raised questions regarding the protective effect of available seasonal vaccines and the efficacy of a newly produced matched vaccine.
5382,Methods.
5383,"Ferrets were immunized with the 2008–2009 formulations of commercially available live attenuated (FluMist; MedImmune) or split-inactivated (Fluviral; GlaxoSmithKline) vaccines, a commercial swine vaccine (FluSure; Pfizer), or a laboratory-produced matched inactivated whole-virus vaccine (A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009)."
5384,"Adaptive immune responses were monitored, and the animals were challenged with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 after 5 weeks."
5385,Results.
5386,"Only animals that received the swine or matched vaccines developed detectable hemagglutination- inhibiting antibodies against the challenge virus, whereas a T cell response was exclusively detected in animals vaccinated with FluMist."
5387,"After challenge, all animals had high levels of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract."
5388,"However, preexisting anti—pandemic H1N1 2009 antibodies resulted in reduced clinical signs and improved survival."
5389,"Surprisingly, FluMist was associated with a slight increase in mortality and greater lung damage, which correlated with early up-regulation of interleukin-10."
5390,Conclusions.
5391,"The present study demonstrates that a single dose of matched inactivated vaccine confers partial protection against a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, and it suggests that a higher dose or prime-boost regimen may be required."
5392,The consequences of mismatched immunity to influenza merit further investigation.
5393,The authors discuss humoral immune responses to HIV and approaches to designing vaccines that induce viral neutralizing and other potentially protective antibodies.
5394,PURPOSE: Malignant melanoma’s (MM) incidence is rising faster than that of any other cancer in the US and the overall survival at 5 years is less than 10%.
5395,B cell associated protein 31 (BAP31) is overexpressed in most MMs and might be a promising target for immunotherapy of this disease.
5396,"EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Firstly, we investigated the expression profiles of human BAP31 (hBAP31) and mouse BAP31 (mBAP31) in human and mouse normal tissues, respectively."
5397,The expression level of hBAP31 in human MMs and mBAP31 in B16 melanoma cells was also analyzed.
5398,Then we constructed novel mBAP31 DNA vaccines and tested there ability to stimulate mBAP31-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice.
5399,"RESULTS: For the first time, we found that protein expression of hBAP31 were dramatically upregulated in human MMs when compared with human normal tissues."
5400,Predominant protein expression of mBAP31 was found in mouse B16 melanoma cells but not in mouse important organs.
5401,"When mice were immunized with mBAP31 DNA vaccines, strong cellular response to mBAP31 was observed in the vaccinated mice."
5402,CTLs isolated from immunized mice could effectively kill mBAP31-positive target mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells in vitro and vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccines had potent anti-tumor activity in therapeutic model using B16 melanoma cells.
5403,CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data supporting a vaccine targeting BAP31 that is capable of inducing effective immunity against BAP31-expressing MMs and will be applicable to human MMs and hBAP31 DNA vaccine warrants investigation in human clinical trials.
5404,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13046-015-0153-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
5405, The use of plants for production of recombinant proteins has evolved over the past 25years.
5406,"The first plant-based vaccines were expressed in stably transgenic plants, with the idea to conveniently deliver “edible vaccines” by ingestion of the antigen-containing plant material."
5407,These systems provided a proof of concept that oral delivery of vaccines in crude plant material could stimulate antigen-specific serum and mucosal antibodies.
5408,Transgenic grains like rice in particular provide a stable and robust vehicle for antigen delivery.
5409,"However, some issues exist with stably transgenic plants, including relatively low expression levels and regulatory issues."
5410,"Thus, many recent studies use transient expression with plant viral vectors to achieve rapid high expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, followed by purification of antigen and intranasal delivery for effective stimulation of mucosal immune responses."
5411, Atomic-level structural information and advances in synthetic biology and nanotechnology have created new opportunities for generating vaccines in a way that has not been possible using traditional methods.
5412,These novel approaches to recombinant vaccine design are opening doors to the development of vaccines against challenging targets.
5413,"In this chapter, we discuss the exceptional humoral immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLPs) and related nanoparticles and their application to vaccine development."
5414,"The emergence of this new category of vaccine platforms is based on recent insights from multiple fields of study, including immunology, virology, nanotechnology, structural biology, synthetic biology, and bioengineering."
5415,"The multidisciplinary work on VLP and nanoparticle immunogens is already yielding dividends for public health, but is also likely to result in safer, more potent and broadly protective vaccines against a wide variety of human and animal pathogens, as well as target host proteins of interest."
5416,"A new disease, severe atypical respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerged in China in late 2002 and developed into the first epidemic of the 21st century."
5417,"The disease was caused by an unknown animal coronavirus (CoV) that had crossed the species barrier through close contact of humans with infected animals, and was identified as the etiological agent for SARS."
5418,This new CoV not only became readily transmissible between humans but also was also more pathogenic.
5419,"The disease spread across the world rapidly due to the air travel, and infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on 5 continents."
5420,"The disease is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including high fever, malaise, cough, diarrhea, and infiltrates visible on chest radiography."
5421,"The overall mortality was about 10%, but varied profoundly with age; the course of disease seemed to be milder in the pediatric age group and resulted rarely in a fatal outcome, but the mortality in the elderly was as high as 50%."
5422,Aggressive quarantine measures taken by the health authorities have successfully contained and terminated the disease transmission.
5423,As a result there are no SARS cases recorded recently.
5424,Nevertheless there is a possibility that the disease may emerge in the population with high vigor.
5425,"Significant progress has been made in understanding the disease biology, pathogenesis, development of animal models, and design and evaluation of different vaccines, and these are the focus of this chapter."
5426,The induction of a robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) response is likely to be as essential as specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against multiple antigens for the development of effective preventive and therapeutic vaccines against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in humans.
5427,"To date, no data on the immunogenicity of the replication-defective vaccinia virus (derived from the Tiantan strain) (rNTV)-based HCV vaccine in primates have been reported."
5428,"This study describes in detail the immunogenicity of various vaccine candidates in rhesus macaques, including rNTV-based and replication-defective recombinant adenoviral (rAd)–based HCV vaccines, as well as HCV pseudotyped virus-like particles (HCVpp)."
5429,"Our data showed that rAd-HCV vaccine boosting induced robust CMI, while priming or boosting with HCVpp enhanced the antigen-specific nAb response after rAd-HCV vaccination; however, CMI was not enhanced."
5430,"Vaccination includes rNTV-HCV priming induced robust antigen-specific antibody, particularly nAbs, and CMI responses."
5431,"Furthermore, more robust and longer-lasting CMI and higher cytokine levels (both Th1 and Th2 types, especially IFN-γ) resulted from boosting with rAd-HCV."
5432,"We conclude that the rNTV-based HCV vaccine induces robust nAbs and CMI when combined with a heterogeneous primer-booster strategy, which shows promise for development of a human HCV vaccine."
5433,"Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is a member of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales."
5434,TGEV is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes highly fatal acute diarrhoea in newborn pigs.
5435,An oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine against anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus developed in our laboratory was used to study mucosal immune responses.
5436,"In this L. casei vaccine, repetitive peptides expressed by L. casei (specifically the MDP and tuftsin fusion protein (MT)) were repeated 20 times and the D antigenic site of the TGEV spike (S) protein was repeated 6 times."
5437,"Immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus is crucial for investigations of the effect of immunization, such as the first immunization time and dose."
5438,The first immunization is more important than the last immunization in the series.
5439,The recombinant Lactobacillus elicited specific systemic and mucosal immune responses.
5440,Recombinant L. casei had a strong potentiating effect on the cellular immunity induced by the oral L. casei vaccine.
5441,"However, during TGEV infection, the systemic and local immune responses switched from Th1 to Th2-based immune responses."
5442,The systemic humoral immune response was stronger than the cellular immune response after TGEV infection.
5443,We found that the recombinant Lactobacillus stimulated IL-17 expression in both the systemic and mucosal immune responses against TGEV infection.
5444,"Furthermore, the Lactobacillus vaccine stimulated an anti-TGEV infection Th17 pathway."
5445,The histopathological examination showed tremendous potential for recombinant Lactobacillus to enable rapid and effective treatment for TGEV with an intestinal tropism in piglets.
5446,The TGEV immune protection was primarily dependent on mucosal immunity.
5447, Different forms of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein-based vaccines for generation of neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV were compared using a mouse model.
5448,High IgG levels were detected in mice immunized with intraperitoneal (i.p.)
5449,"recombinant spike polypeptide generated by Escherichia coli (S-peptide), mice primed with intramuscular (i.m.)"
5450,tPA-optimize800 DNA vaccine (tPA-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p.
5451,"S-peptide, mice primed with i.m."
5452,CTLA4HingeSARS800 DNA vaccine (CTLA4-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p.
5453,"S-peptide, mice primed with oral live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella-S-DNA-control) and boosted with i.p."
5454,"S-peptide, mice primed with oral live-attenuated S. typhimurium that contained tPA-optimize800 DNA vaccine (Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p."
5455,"S-peptide, and mice primed with oral live-attenuated S. typhimurium that contained CTLA4HingeSARS800 DNA vaccine (Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p."
5456,S-peptide.
5457,No statistical significant difference was observed among the Th1/Th2 index among these six groups of mice with high IgG levels.
5458,Sera of all six mice immunized with i.p.
5459,"S-peptide, i.m."
5460,DNA vaccine control and oral Salmonella-S-DNA-control showed no neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV.
5461,Sera of the mice immunized with i.m.
5462,"tPA-S-DNA, i.m."
5463,"CTLA4-S-DNA, oral Salmonella-S-DNA-control boosted with i.p."
5464,"S-peptide, oral Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA, oral Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA boosted with i.p S-peptide, oral Salmonella-CTLA4-S-DNA and oral Salmonella-CTLA4-S-DNA boosted with i.p."
5465,S-peptide showed neutralizing antibody titers of <1:20–1:160.
5466,Sera of all the mice immunized with i.m.
5467,tPA-S-DNA boosted with i.p.
5468,S-peptide and i.m.
5469,CTLA4-S-DNA boosted with i.p.
5470,S-peptide showed neutralizing antibody titers of ≥1:1280.
5471,"The present observation may have major practical value, such as immunization of civet cats, since production of recombinant proteins from E. coli is far less expensive than production of recombinant proteins using eukaryotic systems."
5472,"The original scientific strategy behind vaccinology has historically been to “isolate, inactivate, and inject,” first invoked by Louis Pasteur."
5473," The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected more than 1900 humans, since 2012."
5474,The syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death.
5475,The virus is believed to be circulating in dromedary camels without notable symptoms since the 1980s.
5476,"Therefore, dromedary camels are considered the only animal source of infection."
5477,Neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area.
5478,"Here, we developed four vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV based on ChAdOx1 and MVA viral vectors, two candidates per vector."
5479,"All vaccines contained the full-length spike gene of MERS-CoV; ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) where MVA MERS vaccines were produced with tPA, but either the mH5 or F11 promoter driving expression of the spike gene."
5480,All vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only or prime-boost regimens.
5481,ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA induced higher neutralising antibodies than ChAdOx1 MERS without tPA.
5482,A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA elicited cellular immune responses as well as neutralising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by MVA MERS.
5483,The humoral immunogenicity of a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA was equivalent to two doses of MVA MERS (also with tPA).
5484,"MVA MERS with mH5 or F11 promoter induced similar antibody levels; however, F11 promoter enhanced the cellular immunogenicity of MVA MERS to significantly higher magnitudes."
5485,"In conclusion, our study showed that MERS-CoV vaccine candidates could be optimized by utilising different viral vectors, various genetic designs of the vectors, or different regimens to increase immunogenicity."
5486,ChAdOx1 and MVA vectored vaccines have been safely evaluated in camels and humans and these MERS vaccine candidates should now be tested in camels and in clinical trials.
5487,Development of a SARS vaccine: an industrial perspective on the global race against a global disease
5488," Shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine, which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum."
5489,"Despite of extensive research during the last two decades, a vaccine against multi-drug resistant Shigella is not yet available in the market."
5490,"To provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against Shigella, we explored food grade bacteria Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein; Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity."
5491,We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax® OmpA) in BALB/c mice.
5492,"In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax® OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model."
5493,"The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-γ/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax® OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity."
5494,The LacVax® OmpA immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022.
5495,"The antigen specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA, INF-γ and IL-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection."
5496,Collectively these results suggest that the LacVax® OmpA is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis.
5497,"However, the protective efficacy of LacVax® OmpA in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans."
5498, Safety tested Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is licensed as third-generation vaccine against smallpox and serves as a potent vector system for development of new candidate vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.
5499,"Historically, MVA was developed by serial tissue culture passage in primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara, and clinically used to avoid the undesirable side effects of conventional smallpox vaccination."
5500,Adapted to growth in avian cells MVA lost the ability to replicate in mammalian hosts and lacks many of the genes orthopoxviruses use to conquer their host (cell) environment.
5501,"As a biologically well-characterized mutant virus, MVA facilitates fundamental research to elucidate the functions of poxvirus host-interaction factors."
5502,As extremely safe viral vectors MVA vaccines have been found immunogenic and protective in various preclinical infection models.
5503,"Multiple recombinant MVA currently undergo clinical testing for vaccination against human immunodeficiency viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Plasmodium falciparum."
5504,The versatility of the MVA vector vaccine platform is readily demonstrated by the swift development of experimental vaccines for immunization against emerging infections such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
5505,Recent advances include promising results from the clinical testing of recombinant MVA-producing antigens of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 or Ebola virus.
5506,"This review summarizes our current knowledge about MVA as a unique strain of vaccinia virus, and discusses the prospects of exploiting this virus as research tool in poxvirus biology or as safe viral vector vaccine to challenge existing and future bottlenecks in vaccinology."
5507," Yersinia Pestis outer proteins, plasminogen activator protease and Yop secretion protein F are necessary for the full virulence of Yesinia pestis and have been proposed as potential protective antigens for vaccines against plague."
5508,"In the current study, we used DNA immunization as a tool to study the relative protective immunity of these proteins with a standardized intranasal challenge system in mice."
5509,"While the natural full-length gene sequences for most of these Y. pestis proteins did not display a good level of protein expression in vitro when delivered by a DNA vaccine vector, the overall immunogenicity of these wild type gene DNA vaccines was low in eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses and gene sequence modifications improved both of these parameters."
5510,"However, even modified YopD, YopO and YscF antigens were only able to partially protect immunized mice at various levels against lethal challenge with Y. pestis KIM 1001 strain while no protection was observed with either the YopB or Pla antigens."
5511,"These results demonstrate that DNA immunization is effective in screening, optimizing and comparing optimal antigen designs and immunogenicity of candidate antigens for the development of a subunit-based plague vaccine."
5512," Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to occur, making it one of the WHO´s targets for accelerated vaccine development."
5513,One vaccine candidate is based on live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine encoding the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (MERS-S).
5514,MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induces robust humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-S mediating protection.
5515,"Here, the induction and nature of immunity after vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or novel MVvac2-MERS-N were further characterized."
5516,"We focused on the necessity for vector replication and the nature of induced T cells, since functional CD8+ T cells contribute importantly to clearance of MERS-CoV."
5517,"While no immunity against MERS-CoV or MV was detected in MV-susceptible mice after immunization with UV-inactivated virus, replication-competent MVvac2-MERS-S(H) triggered robust neutralizing antibody titers also in adult mice."
5518,"Furthermore, a significant fraction of MERS CoV-specific CD8+ T cells and MV-specific CD4+ T cells simultaneously expressing IFN-γ and TNF-α were induced, revealing that MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induces multifunctional cellular immunity."
5519," The majority of vaccines licensed for controlling infectious disease of veterinary species today are based on technology that was introduced by Jenner using live vaccines and Pasteur using killed whole organism vaccines 200 and 100 years ago, respectively, yet this former technology has not stopped several successful vaccination programs from being developed."
5520,"Much of veterinary vaccinology is driven by the realities that exist in raising production animals or working in veterinary practice, where making a living depends on keeping the animals healthy, because it is an industry where vaccines are like insurance policies—protection from events that one hopes never happen."
5521,"For example, the USDA recognizes these varying levels of protection in the way that they allow label claims: (1) “aids in disease control,” (2) “for the prevention of disease,” and (3) “for the prevention of infection.” Additionally there may be indirect protection, or herd immunity, that results from vaccination of sufficient numbers of animals in a given population resulting in the reduction of the ability of a disease to transmit through the vaccinated individuals."
5522,"The perception that vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, where the disease agent does not establish an infection, while widely held, is generally unfounded and largely unrealistic."
5523,"Recent advances, especially in the last 15 years in genomics, proteomics, biotechnology, immunology, pathogenesis, and vaccine formulation and delivery have dramatically changed our approach to vaccine development."
5524,"When used optimally, vaccines have been shown to prevent disease, reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention, and improve the health and welfare of animals, and indirectly people as well."
5525,"The challenge in developing an optimal vaccination program is in dealing with the great diversity that exists within the animal world, and as such there probably is no single optimal program for all occasions."
5526,"While there is no magic solution to optimizing vaccination programs for animals, nonetheless, a solid understanding of the animal’s innate and environmental risk factors as well as the variables such as stress will enable the development of tailored vaccination schedules that best meets the needs of the animal."
5527,"The use of vaccines in animal health is not restricted to the protection of morbidity and mortality of the animal hosts themselves, but they are regularly employed as key elements in public health programs."
5528,"When appropriate biopreparedness, management modeling strategies, and contingency plans of the future are linked with (1) protective DIVA vaccines against zoonoses, (2) effective predictive modeling, and (3) deployable implementation policies, control, and prevention of serious zoonotic diseases of man and animals will become more achievable at local, state, and national levels."
5529, Virus-like particles (VLPs) present viral antigens in a native conformation and are effectively recognized by the immune system and therefore are considered as suitable and safe vaccine candidates against many viral diseases.
5530,"Here we demonstrate that chimeric VLPs containing Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) glycoproteins GN and GC, nucleoprotein N and the gag protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus represent an effective vaccine candidate against Rift Valley fever, a deadly disease in humans and livestock."
5531,Long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses are demonstrated in a mouse model by the analysis of neutralizing antibody titers and cytokine secretion profiles.
5532,Vaccine efficacy studies were performed in mouse and rat lethal challenge models resulting in high protection rates.
5533,"Taken together, these results demonstrate that replication-incompetent chimeric RVF VLPs are an efficient RVFV vaccine candidate."
5534,"Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is a highly infectious disease in pigs."
5535,Vaccination is an effective approach to prevent TGEV infection.
5536,"Here, we evaluated the potential of TGEV S1 as a DNA vaccine and porcine interleukin (pIL)-12 as an adjuvant in a mouse model."
5537,A DNA vaccine was constructed with the TGEV S1 gene to induce immune response in an experimental mouse model; pIL-12 was chosen as the immunological adjuvant within this DNA vaccine.
5538,The pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) vectors were transfected into BHK-21 cells and expressed in vitro.
5539,Experimental mice were separately immunized with each of the recombinant plasmids and controls through the intramuscular route.
5540,"The lymphocytes isolated from the blood and spleen were analyzed for proliferation, cytotoxic activities, and populations of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells."
5541,The titers of TGEV S1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and TGEV neutralizing antibodies and the concentrations of interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-4 were also analyzed in the serum.
5542,"The plasmids pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) could be expressed in BHK-21 cells, and the combination of pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) could induce a significant increase in all markers."
5543,pIL-12 could act as an immunological adjuvant in the DNA vaccine for TGEV-S1.
5544,"Furthermore, the DNA vaccine prepared using TGEV-S1 and porcine IL-12 could induce excellent humoral and cellular immune responses."
5545,": The development of the innate and adaptive immune responses to Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) after vaccination of 1 day-old pigs with a PRRSV-1 based modified live virus (MLV) vaccine by intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN) routes was characterised, before and after challenge with a heterologous PRRSV-1 isolate at 18 weeks post-vaccination."
5546,Twenty-five PRRSV-seronegative piglets were used.
5547,"At 1 day of age, pigs were administered with a single dose of vaccine via the IM (n = 10) or the IN route (n = 10)."
5548,Control group (n = 5) received saline solution.
5549,"After vaccination, pigs were bled at days 3, 7, 28, 56, 83, 113 and 125."
5550,"Levels of cytokines IL-10, IL-8, IFN-α (measured by ELISA tests of serum), TNF-α and IFN-γ (measured by ELISA and ELISPOT, respectively, from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and serum neutralising antibodies (NA) to the vaccine strain, were measured."
5551,"RESULTS: The induction of IL-10 was rare, indicating that IL-10 mediated immunomodulation/immune dysfunction was not a feature of this vaccine or of the challenge virus."
5552,"IL-8 was detected in only two pigs following vaccination, but in the majority of pigs after challenge, indicating that their ability to produce an innate immune response was not impaired."
5553,TNF-α was not detected in any vaccinated pigs until day 83.
5554,"After challenge, only a minority of pigs produced TNF-α."
5555,"IFN-α was detected in all vaccinated pigs following vaccination, indicating the potential for development of an effective Th1 adaptive immune response."
5556,IFN-γ-secreting cells were detected in all vaccinated pigs after vaccination.
5557,"NA to the vaccine strain were first detected at day 56 in pigs vaccinated by both routes, and remained at similar levels until challenge."
5558,"After challenge, a boost in NA was observed."
5559,The efficacy of the vaccine was demonstrated by reduction of viraemia and nasal shedding after challenge.
5560,"CONCLUSIONS: The administration of a PRRSV-1 based MLV vaccine to 1 day-old piglets was able to induce an immune response characterised by: (1) undetectable or low levels of IL-10, IL-8 and TNF-α, (2) an increase in IFN-α expression within the first seven days, (3) a gradual increase in the number of antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells, and (4) induction of detectable NA."
5561,"After challenge with a heterologous strain, there was a rapid boost in NA titres, indicating a priming effect of the vaccine."
5562,"Attenuated measles virus (MV) is one of the most effective and safe vaccines available, making it attractive candidate vector to prevent infectious diseases."
5563,Attenuated MV have acquired the ability to use the complement regulator CD46 as a major receptor to mediate virus entry and intercellular fusion.
5564,"Therefore, attenuated MV strains preferentially infect and destroy a wide variety of cancer cells making them also attractive oncolytic vectors."
5565,"The use of recombinant MV vector has to comply with various regulatory requirements, particularly relating to the assessment of potential risks for human health and the environment."
5566,The present article highlights the main characteristics of MV and recombinant MV vectors used for vaccination and virotherapy and discusses these features from a biosafety point of view.
5567,"Virus evolves rapidly to escape vaccine-induced immunity, posing a desperate demand for efficient vaccine development biotechnologies."
5568,"Here we present an express vaccine development strategy based on CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre/Lox system against re-emerging Pseudorabies virus, which caused the recent devastating swine pseudorabies outbreak in China."
5569,"By CRISPR/Cas9 system, the virulent genes of the newly isolated strain were simultaneously substituted by marker genes, which were subsequently excised using Cre/Lox system for vaccine safety concern."
5570,"Notably, single cell FACS technology was applied to further promote virus purification efficiency."
5571,The combination of these state-of-art technologies greatly accelerated vaccine development.
5572,"Finally, vaccination and challenge experiments proved this vaccine candidate’s protective efficacy in pigs and the promise to control current pseudorabies outbreak."
5573,"This is, to our knowledge, the first successful vaccine development based on gene edit technologies, demonstrating these technologies leap from laboratory to industry."
5574,It may pave the way for future express antiviral vaccine development.
5575,"Since it emerged in Brazil in May 2015, the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has raised global concern due to its association with a significant rise in the number of infants born with microcephaly and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome."
5576,We developed prototype subunit and adenoviral-based Zika vaccines encoding the extracellular portion of the ZIKV envelope gene (E) fused to the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (Efl).
5577,The subunit vaccine was delivered intradermally through carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle array (MNA).
5578,"The immunogenicity of these two vaccines, named Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and ZIKV-rEfl, was tested in C57BL/6 mice."
5579,"Prime/boost immunization regimen was associated with induction of a ZIKV-specific antibody response, which provided neutralizing immunity."
5580,"Moreover, protection was evaluated in seven-day-old pups after virulent ZIKV intraperitoneal challenge."
5581,"Pups born to mice immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl were all protected against lethal challenge infection without weight loss or neurological signs, while pups born to dams immunized with MNA-ZIKV-rEfl were partially protected (50%)."
5582,No protection was seen in pups born to phosphate buffered saline-immunized mice.
5583,"This study illustrates the preliminary efficacy of the E ZIKV antigen vaccination in controlling ZIKV infectivity, providing a promising candidate vaccine and antigen format for the prevention of Zika virus disease."
5584,Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infects 2% of the world’s population and is the leading cause of liver disease and liver transplantation.
5585,It poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies.
5586,"However, these treatments will not prevent re-infection particularly in high risk populations."
5587,"The introduction of a HCV vaccine has been predicted, using simulation models in a high risk population, to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of HCV."
5588,A vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce HCV incidence in this population.
5589,Virus like particles (VLPs) are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses.
5590,"Thus, VLPs represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses."
5591,"Currently, many VLP-based vaccines have entered clinical trials, while licensed VLP vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) have been in use for many years."
5592,"The HCV core, E1 and E2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic VLPs while inclusion of HCV antigens into heterogenous (chimeric) VLPs is also a promising approach."
5593,"These VLPs are produced using different expression systems such as bacterial, yeast, mammalian, plant, or insect cells."
5594,"Here, this paper will review HCV VLP-based vaccines and their immunogenicity in animal models as well as the different expression systems used in their production."
5595," AND AIM: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is still a major problem among poultry industry in Indonesia, IB outbreaks continue to happen even in vaccinated flocks."
5596,"The emergence of new IB virus (IBV) variants might lead to mismatching between vaccine virus strain and circulating virus strain, this may be a reason of vaccination failure."
5597,Information about circulating IBV in a region is important to decide which IB vaccine should be used.
5598,"However, information about recent IBV strains which circulated in Indonesia and their genetic characters were limited; therefore, the aim of our research was to determine the genetic characterization of S1 gene of IBV isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia."
5599,MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 viral isolate samples collected from chickens with clinical sign and reduced in egg production.
5600,"Six IB live vaccines were used as control, the reference vaccines represent IBV strains including H120, H52, 4/91, CR88, 233A, and 1-96."
5601,Primers XCe2+ and XCe2- were used to amplify S1 gene partially.
5602,RESULTS: Twenty-six of 47 samples showed positive result to S1 gene of IBV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
5603,"Three IBV isolates, Indonesia/K233A31/18, Indonesia/K4A9/17, and Indonesia/P3/17, were selected for nucleotide sequencing."
5604,"Phylogenetic analysis of 352 nucleotides of the partial S1 gene shows that isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 have 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 4/91, while isolate Indonesia/P3/17 has 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 233A."
5605,"CONCLUSION: Our result indicates that at least two IBV strains were circulating among poultry in West Java, Indonesia, which is IBV close to vaccine strain 4/91 and 233A."
5606,"The present study provides updates on the circulating IBV in commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia, and might use as guidance on selecting a proper IB vaccine strain to improve IB vaccination efficacy in certain region."
5607,: The development of a protective vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is an alternative approach for interrupting the domestic cycle of Leishmania infantum.
5608,"Given the importance of sand fly salivary proteins as potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in the last few decades."
5609,"In this context, we previously immunized dogs with a vaccine composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as the adjuvant and sand fly salivary gland extract (LBSapSal vaccine)."
5610,"This vaccine elicited an increase in both anti-saliva and anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, higher counts of specific circulating CD8(+) T cells, and high NO production."
5611,METHODS: We investigated the immunogenicity and protective effect of LBSapSal vaccination after intradermal challenge with 1 × 10(7) late-log-phase L. infantum promastigotes in the presence of sand fly saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis.
5612,The dogs were followed for up to 885 days after challenge.
5613,"RESULTS: The LBSapSal vaccine presents extensive antigenic diversity with persistent humoral and cellular immune responses, indicating resistance against CVL is triggered by high levels of total IgG and its subtypes (IgG1 and IgG2); expansion of circulating CD5(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and is Leishmania-specific; and reduction of splenic parasite load."
5614,CONCLUSIONS: These results encourage further study of vaccine strategies addressing Leishmania antigens in combination with proteins present in the saliva of the vector.
5615,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) of the genus alphavirus is a mosquito-transmitted emerging infectious disease that causes an acute febrile illness, rash, headaches, and nausea that may turn into incapacitating, persistent arthralgias in some victims."
5616,"Since its discovery in Trinidad in 1954, cases of MAYV infection have largely been confined there and to the northern countries of South America, but recently, MAYV cases have been reported in some island nations in the Caribbean Sea."
5617,"Accompanying these reports is evidence that new vectors, including Aedes spp."
5618,"mosquitos, recently implicated in the global spread of Zika and chikungunya viruses, are competent for MAYV transmission, which, if true, could facilitate the spread of MAYV beyond its current range."
5619,"Despite its status as an emerging virus, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent MAYV infection nor therapeutics to treat it."
5620,"Here, we describe the development and testing of a novel DNA vaccine, scMAYV-E, that encodes a synthetically-designed consensus MAYV envelope sequence."
5621,In vivo electroporation-enhanced immunization of mice with this vaccine induced potent humoral responses including neutralizing antibodies as well as robust T-cell responses to multiple epitopes in the MAYV envelope.
5622,"Importantly, these scMAYV-E-induced immune responses protected susceptible mice from morbidity and mortality following a MAYV challenge."
5623,"In recent years, the emergence of several highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases in humans has led to a renewed emphasis on the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, otherwise known as One Health."
5624,"For example, Hendra virus (HeV), a zoonotic paramyxovirus, was discovered in 1994, and since then, infections have occurred in 7 humans, each of whom had a strong epidemiologic link to similarly affected horses."
5625,"As a consequence of these outbreaks, eradication of bat populations was discussed, despite their crucial environmental roles in pollination and reduction of the insect population."
5626,"We describe the development and evaluation of a vaccine for horses with the potential for breaking the chain of HeV transmission from bats to horses to humans, thereby protecting horse, human, and environmental health."
5627,The HeV vaccine for horses is a key example of a One Health approach to the control of human disease.
5628, An effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will probably require the generation and maintenance of both humoral and cellular immune responses.
5629,"It has been reported that after natural infection in humans and immunization in animals with SARS-CoV vaccine, antibody is produced and persistent for a long period of time."
5630,"In the present study, mice were immunized i.m."
5631,"with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, and three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses when the cells were stimulated in vitro with a pool of peptides overlapping entire SARS spike protein."
5632,The results show that prime-immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.
5633,Boosting with the same vaccine enhances CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs and were persistent over two months.
5634,"The SARS-CoV S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were CD62L−, a marker for memory cells, and −30 to 50% of the cells expressed IL-7Rα (CD127), a marker for the capacity of effector cells to develop into memory cells."
5635,"In addition, immunization with the DNA vaccine elicited high levels of antibody production."
5636,"Taken together, these data demonstrate that immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can generate antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses that may contribute to long-term protection."
5637,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute, often fatal viral disease characterized by rapid onset of febrile symptoms followed by hemorrhagic manifestations."
5638,"The etiologic agent, CCHF orthonairovirus (CCHFV), can infect several mammals in nature but only seems to cause clinical disease in humans."
5639,"Over the past two decades there has been an increase in total number of CCHF case reports, including imported CCHF patients, and an expansion of CCHF endemic areas."
5640,Despite its increased public health burden there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent CCHF.
5641,We here report the development and assessment of the protective efficacy of an adenovirus (Ad)-based vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N) of CCHFV (Ad-N) in a lethal immunocompromised mouse model of CCHF.
5642,The results show that Ad-N can protect mice from CCHF mortality and that this platform should be considered for future CCHFV vaccine strategies.
5643,"Since May 2006, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has emerged and prevailed in mainland China, affecting over 2 million pigs."
5644,Commercial PRRSV killed and modified live vaccines cannot provide complete protection against HP-PRRSV due to genetic variation.
5645,Development of more effective vaccines against the emerging HP-PRRSV is urgently required.
5646,"In our previous studies, two formulations of DNA vaccines (pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5) based on the HP-PRRSV were constructed and shown to induce enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses in mice."
5647,The objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response induced by these novel formulations in piglets.
5648,PcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 vaccines induced significantly enhanced GP5-specific antibody and PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibody in pigs compared with the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 parental construct.
5649,"Though IFN-γ levels and lymphocyte proliferation responses induced by the two DNA vaccine formulations were comparable to that induced by the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 construct, each of the novel formulations provided efficient protection against challenge with HP-PRRSV."
5650,Non-severe clinical signs and rectal temperatures were observed in pigs immunized with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 compared with other groups.
5651,"Thus, these novel DNA constructs may represent promising candidate vaccines against emerging HP-PRRSV."
5652,Canine Distemper Spillover in Domestic Dogs from Urban Wildlife
5653,DNA vaccines induce humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and humans.
5654,"To analyze the immunogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, spike DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), DNA vaccine plasmids pcDNA-S and pcDNA-IL-2 were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL-2 by using three different immunization routes (the intramuscular route, electroporation, or the oral route with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium)."
5655,"The cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, lymphocyte proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses."
5656,The results showed that specific humoral and cellular immunities could be induced in mice by inoculating them with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine alone or by coinoculation with IL-2-expressing plasmids.
5657,"In addition, the immune response levels in the coinoculation groups were significantly higher than those in groups receiving the spike DNA vaccine alone."
5658,The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that oral vaccination evoked a vigorous T-cell response and a weak response predominantly with subclass immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody.
5659,"However, intramuscular immunization evoked a vigorous antibody response and a weak T-cell response, and vaccination by electroporation evoked a vigorous response with a predominant subclass IgG1 antibody response and a moderate T-cell response."
5660,"Our findings show that the spike DNA vaccine has good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunities in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances the humoral and cellular immune responses."
5661,Different vaccination routes also evoke distinct immune responses.
5662,This study provides basic information for the design of DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV.
5663,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic virus that causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatality rate close to 40%, but for which no vaccines are available."
5664,"Here, we evaluated the utility of ChAdOx1, a promising replication-deficient simian adenovirus vaccine vector platform with an established safety profile in humans and dromedary camels, for MERS-CoV vaccine development."
5665,"Using a transgenic lethal BALB/c MERS-CoV mouse model we showed that single dose intranasal or intramuscular immunisation with ChAdOx1 MERS, encoding full-length MERS-CoV Spike glycoprotein, is highly immunogenic and confers protection against lethal viral challenge."
5666,Immunogenicity and efficacy were comparable between immunisation routes.
5667,"Together these data provide support for further evaluation of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine in humans and dromedary camels, the animal reservoir of infection."
5668,"Traditionally, vaccines have been developed by cultivating infectious agents and isolating the inactivated whole pathogen or some of its purified components."
5669,"20 years ago, reverse vaccinology enabled vaccine discovery and design based on information deriving from the sequence of microbial genomes rather than via the growth of pathogens."
5670,"Today, the high throughput discovery of protective human antibodies, sequencing of the B cell repertoire, and the increasing structural characterization of protective antigens and epitopes provide the molecular and mechanistic understanding to drive the discovery of novel vaccines that were previously impossible."
5671,We are entering a “reverse vaccinology 2.0” era.
5672,The Cell Biology of Acute Childhood Respiratory Disease: Therapeutic Implications
5673,: One of the major obstacles in the design of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is the hypervariability of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.
5674,"Most HIV-1 vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity."
5675,"Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1."
5676,We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized hamsters.
5677,"RESULTS: We amplified and characterized 14 different gp120s from primary subtype B isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines."
5678,Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters.
5679,The polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins.
5680,"However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates."
5681,"Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E CONCLUSION: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity."
5682,"The filoviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus, cause severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality in humans and nonhuman primates."
5683,Among the most promising filovirus vaccines under development is a system based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) that expresses an individual filovirus glycoprotein (GP) in place of the VSV glycoprotein (G).
5684,"The main concern with all replication-competent vaccines, including the rVSV filovirus GP vectors, is their safety."
5685,"To address this concern, we performed a neurovirulence study using 21 cynomolgus macaques where the vaccines were administered intrathalamically."
5686,"Seven animals received a rVSV vector expressing the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) GP; seven animals received a rVSV vector expressing the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (MARV) GP; three animals received rVSV-wild type (wt) vector, and four animals received vehicle control."
5687,"Two of three animals given rVSV-wt showed severe neurological symptoms whereas animals receiving vehicle control, rVSV-ZEBOV-GP, or rVSV-MARV-GP did not develop these symptoms."
5688,"Histological analysis revealed major lesions in neural tissues of all three rVSV-wt animals; however, no significant lesions were observed in any animals from the filovirus vaccine or vehicle control groups."
5689,These data strongly suggest that rVSV filovirus GP vaccine vectors lack the neurovirulence properties associated with the rVSV-wt parent vector and support their further development as a vaccine platform for human use.
5690,Understanding immune responses to viral infections is crucial to progress in the quest for effective infection prevention and control.
5691,The host immunity involves various mechanisms to combat viral infections.
5692,"Under certain circumstances, a viral infection or vaccination may result in a subverted immune system, which may lead to an exacerbated illness."
5693,"Clinical evidence of enhanced illness by preexisting antibodies from vaccination, infection or maternal passive immunity is available for several viruses and is presumptively proposed for other viruses."
5694,Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon.
5695,It has been confirmed that certain infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity could exacerbate viral infectivity in Fc receptor- or complement bearing cells- mediated mechanisms.
5696,"Considering that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is a major obstacle in vaccine development, there are continues efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms through identification of the epitopes and antibodies responsible for disease enhancement or protection."
5697,"This review discusses the recent findings on virally induced ADE, and highlights the potential mechanisms leading to this condition."
5698,The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were investigated.
5699,"DNA vaccine plasmids, pcDNA-N and pcDNA-IL2, were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL2 by intramuscular injection."
5700,"Cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by indirect ELISA, lymphocyte proliferation assays, ELISPOT and FACS."
5701,"The nucleocapsid DNA vaccine had good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunity in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances specific immune responses."
5702,This study provides a frame of reference for the design of DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV.
5703,": Infection control measures have played a major role in limiting human/camel-to-human transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); however, development of effective and safe human or camel vaccines is warranted."
5704,METHODS: We extended and optimized our previous recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5)–based vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and CD40-mediated specific responses to generate MERS-CoV S1 subunit-based vaccine.
5705,"We generated rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L), untargeted S1 (rAd5-S1), and Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP), and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg(+)) mice."
5706,RESULTS: Immunization of hDPP4 Tg(+) mice with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L elicited as robust and significant specific immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of rAd5-S1.
5707,"After MERS-CoV challenge, both vaccines conferred complete protection against morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by significantly undetectable/reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group."
5708,"However, rAd5-S1– but not rAd5-S1/F/CD40L–immunized mice exhibited marked pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage post–MERS-CoV challenge despite the observed protection."
5709,"CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of CD40L into rAd5-based MERS-CoV S1 vaccine targeting molecule and molecular adjuvants not only enhances immunogenicity and efficacy but also prevents inadvertent pulmonary pathology after viral challenge, thereby offering a promising strategy to enhance safety and potency of vaccines."
5710,Hantaviruses (HVs) are rodent-transmitted viruses that can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia.
5711,"Together, these viruses have annually caused approximately 200,000 human infections worldwide in recent years, with a case fatality rate of 5–15% for HFRS and up to 40% for HCPS."
5712,There is currently no effective treatment available for either HFRS or HCPS.
5713,"Only whole virus inactivated vaccines against HTNV or SEOV are licensed for use in the Republic of Korea and China, but the protective efficacies of these vaccines are uncertain."
5714,"To a large extent, the immune correlates of protection against hantavirus are not known."
5715,"In this review, we summarized the epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis of four HFRS-causing viruses, HTNV, SEOV, PUUV, and DOBV, and two HCPS-causing viruses, ANDV and SNV, and then discussed the existing knowledge on vaccines and therapeutics against these diseases."
5716,We think that this information will shed light on the rational development of new vaccines and treatments.
5717,The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has become a major global health problem.
5718,"Upon infection, chikungunya fever (CHIKF) can result in long-term joint pain and arthritis, and despite intense research, no licensed vaccine for CHIKV is available."
5719,"We have developed two recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1) that induce swift and robust anti-CHIKV immune responses with a single dose, without the need for adjuvants or booster vaccines."
5720,"Here, we report the vaccines’ protective efficacies against CHIKV infection in a lethal A129 mouse model."
5721,"Our results indicate that a single, un-adjuvanted ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik ΔCap dose provided complete protection against a lethal virus challenge and prevented CHIKV-associated severe inflammation."
5722,"These candidate vaccines supported survival equal to the attenuated 181/25 CHIKV reference vaccine but without the vaccine-related side effects, such as weight loss."
5723,"Vaccination with either ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik ΔCap resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies that are associated with protection, indicating that the presence of the capsid within the vaccine construct may not be essential to afford protection under the conditions tested."
5724,We conclude that both replication-deficient ChAdOx1 Chik vaccines are safe even when used in A129 mice and afford complete protection from a lethal challenge.
5725,"DNA immunization was discovered in early 1990s and its use has been expanded from vaccine studies to a broader range of biomedical research, such as the generation of high quality polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as research reagents."
5726,"In this unit, three common DNA immunization methods are described: needle injection, electroporation and gene gun."
5727,"In addition, several common considerations related to DNA immunization are discussed."
5728,In biomedical research recombinant poxviruses are investigated as important candidate medicines to derive advanced options for prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases or cancer.
5729,"Genetically engineered viruses can readily synthesize biologically active heterologous proteins, serve to determine relevant targets of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and identify types of immune responses needed for protection against a multitude of different specific diseases."
5730,"Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing."
5731,"Moreover, advances in deciphering the molecular pathways regulating poxvirus-host interactions will provide additional means to potently activate innate immune stimulation upon vaccination and to derive vectors with specifically targeted replicative capacity for experimental tumor therapy."
5732," Cellular and humoral immune responses of dogs to a candidate vaccine, composed of Leishmania braziliensis promastigote protein plus saponin as adjuvant, have been investigated as a pre-requisite to understanding the mechanisms of immunogenicity against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL)."
5733,"The candidate vaccine elicited strong antigenicity related to the increases of anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, together with higher levels of lymphocytes, particularly of circulating CD8+ T-lymphocytes and Leishmania chagasi antigen-specific CD8+ T-lymphocytes."
5734,"As indicated by the intense cell proliferation and increased nitric oxide production during in vitro stimulation by L. chagasi soluble antigens, the candidate vaccine elicited an immune activation status potentially compatible with effective control of the etiological agent of CVL."
5735,": Type I interferons (IFNs) exhibit direct antiviral effects, but also distinct immunomodulatory properties."
5736,"In this study, we analyzed type I IFN subtypes for their effect on prophylactic adenovirus-based anti-retroviral vaccination of mice against Friend retrovirus (FV) or HIV."
5737,"RESULTS: Mice were vaccinated with adenoviral vectors encoding FV Env and Gag proteins alone or in combination with vectors encoding IFNα1, IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα5, IFNα6, IFNα9 or IFNβ."
5738,"Only the co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 and IFNα9 resulted in strongly improved immune protection of vaccinated mice from subsequent FV challenge infection with high control over FV-induced splenomegaly and reduced viral loads."
5739,The level of protection correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4(+ )T cell responses and enhanced antibody titers.
5740,Similar results were obtained when mice were vaccinated against HIV with adenoviral vectors encoding HIV Env and Gag-Pol in combination with various type I IFN encoding vectors.
5741,Here mainly CD4(+ )T cell responses were enhanced by IFNα subtypes.
5742,CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that certain IFNα subtypes have the potential to improve the protective effect of adenovirus-based vaccines against retroviruses.
5743,This correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4(+ )T cell and antibody responses.
5744,"Thus, co-expression of select type I IFNs may be a valuable tool for the development of anti-retroviral vaccines."
5745,: American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) are an important indoor allergen source and a major risk factor for exacerbations and poor control of asthma.
5746,We previously reported that allergen components from American cockroaches exhibit varying levels of pathogenicity.
5747,"Sensitization to major American cockroach allergen, Per a 2, correlated with more severe clinical phenotypes among patients with allergic airway diseases."
5748,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined whether oral plant vaccine-encoding full-length Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice."
5749,The cDNAs coding Per a 2–996 and Per a 2–372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage.
5750,Adult female BALB/c mice were fed with the cabbage extracts for 21 days and subsequently underwent two-step sensitization with recombinant Per a 2.
5751,RESULTS: Per a 2-specific IgE measured by in-house ELISA in the sera of Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than in the control groups after allergen challenge but not the Per a 2-996-treated group.
5752,"Moreover, Per a 2–372 vaccine markedly decreased airway hyper-responsiveness and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, as well as reduced mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in comparison with the control mice."
5753,CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that oral administration of edible plant vaccine encoding Per a 2 hypo-allergen may be used as a prophylactic strategy against the development of cockroach allergy.
5754," The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat."
5755,"Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics."
5756,"To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol)."
5757,"In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV."
5758,"As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine."
5759,: The global burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in terms of morbidity and mortality is immense.
5760,Novel treatments that can induce a protective immune response are urgently needed to effectively control the HBV epidemic and eventually eradicate chronic HBV infection.
5761,"METHODS: We designed and evaluated an HBV therapeutic vaccine consisting of a novel Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist T7-EA, an Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein."
5762,"We used RNA-seq, ELISA and hTLR7/8 reporting assays to characterize T7-EA in vitro and real-time PCR to evaluate the tissue-retention characteristics in vivo."
5763,"To evaluate the adjuvant potential, we administrated T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with an Alum adjuvant and HBsAg in normal and HBV mice, then, we evaluated the HBsAg-specific immune responses by ELISA and Elispot assays."
5764,"RESULTS: T7-EA acted as an hTLR7-specific agonist and induced a similar gene expression pattern as an unmodified TLR7 ligand when Raw 264.7 cells were exposed to T7-EA; however, T7-EA was more potent than the unmodified TLR7 ligand."
5765,In vivo studies showed that T7-EA had tissue-retaining activity with stimulating local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days.
5766,"T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and a T-cell response in normal mice compared to mice received traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine."
5767,"Importantly, T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistent HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in an HBV mouse model."
5768,CONCLUSIONS: T7-EA might be a candidate adjuvant in a prophylactic and therapeutic HBV vaccine.

5770,Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) was selected as a transgenic vehicle for the development of live mucosal vaccines against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) based on the M gene.
5771,"An approximate 1.0 kb DNA fragment, encoding for glycoprotein M, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1."
5772,"The recombinant plasmid pVAX-M was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, and the expression and translation of the pVAX-M delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M) was detected both in vitro and in vivo."
5773,BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-M) at different dosages to evaluate safety of the vaccines.
5774,"The bacterium was safe to mice at a dosage of 2 × 10(9) CFU, almost eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization and eventually cleared at week 6."
5775,"Mice immunized with 1 × 10(9) CFU of SL7207 (pVAX-M) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses including levels of IgA, IgG, IL-4, and IFN-γ as measured by indirect ELISA assay."
5776,"Moreover, the control groups (pVAX group, PBS group) maintained at a normal level during week 4–8 post-immunization."
5777,The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV M gene vaccine.
5778," Recognition of the mucosal portal of entry for many infectious diseases and of the relevance of mucosal immune response to protection has encouraged the development of vaccines administered by mucosal routes, principally oral and intranasal, for stimulation of intestinal and nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissues respectively."
5779,"The oral route is problematic in cattle and other ruminants where antigen degradation in the rumen is likely, prior to transit to the intestine."
5780,"On the other hand, rumination can be exploited for exposure of nasopharyngeal tissues during cudding if vaccine antigen is expressed by a fibrous feed like alfalfa."
5781,"An increase in anti-leukotoxin (Lkt) IgA was demonstrated in nasal secretions of calves following feeding of alfalfa expressing a truncated Lkt50 from Mannheimia haemolytica, and there is evidence suggesting that such vaccination may protect against experimentally induced pneumonia."
5782,Intranasal vaccination is an alternative approach for use in pre-ruminating calves.
5783,"Intranasal administration of ISCOMs carrying soluble antigens of M. haemolytica, including native Lkt, induced Lkt specific IgA in nasal secretions after vaccination at 4 and 6 weeks of age."
5784,"Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of the same vaccine induced Lkt specific IgG in both serum and nasal secretions, whereas s.c. administration of a commercial M. haemolytica vaccine did not."
5785,"Regardless of the vaccination strategy employed it is difficult to assess the immunogenicity of mucosally administered vaccines because production of secreted antibodies tends to be transient, and they do not persist on the mucosal surface in the absence of ongoing antigenic stimulation."
5786,An additional challenge is demonstration of vaccine efficacy in response to experimental infection.
5787,"Protection of the mucosally vaccinated animal will most probably result from recall response, which may not amplify sufficiently to counter the effects of experimental pulmonary delivery of a large bolus of virulent bacteria, even though the response would suffice over the more prolonged and gradual infection that occurs in natural induction of pneumonia."
5788,Pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is common in the general population.
5789,Bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize Ad5 vaccine efficacy.
5790,Vaccination by the intramuscular (I.M.
5791,"), nasal (I.N.)"
5792,or oral (P.O.)
5793,route with Ad5 expressing Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (Ad5-ZGP) fully protected naïve mice against lethal challenge with Ebola.
5794,"In the presence of pre-existing immunity, only mice vaccinated I.N."
5795,survived.
5796,The frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells was reduced by 80% and by 15% in animals vaccinated by the I.M.
5797,and P.O.
5798,routes respectively.
5799,Neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group.
5800,"Pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (3.9±1% naïve vs. 3.6±1% pre-existing immunity, PEI) nor anti-Ebola neutralizing antibody (NAB, 40±10 reciprocal dilution, both groups)."
5801,The number of INF-γ+ CD8+ cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after I.N.
5802,"immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (146±14, naïve vs. 120±16 SFC/million MNCs, PEI)."
5803,"However, pre-existing immunity reduced NAB levels in BAL by ∼25% in this group."
5804,"To improve the immune response after oral vaccination, the Ad5-based vaccine was PEGylated."
5805,Mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells 10 days after administration (0.3±0.3% PEG vs. 1.7±0.5% unmodified).
5806,PEGylation did increase NAB levels 2-fold.
5807,These results provide some insight about the degree of T and B cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against Ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an Ad5-based vaccine.
5808," The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)."
5809,CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models.
5810,"The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design."
5811,Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein.
5812,CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2b-restricted epitopes (S436–443 and S525–532) and one H-2d-restricted epitope (S366–374).
5813,The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection.
5814,"Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in the context of replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine carriers."
5815,The optimized recombinant adenoviral vaccine vectors encoding spike can generate robust antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice and may potentially be useful for control of SARS-CoV infection.
5816,Vaccines currently licensed for the prevention of seasonal influenza induce antibodies against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) contained in the vaccine preparation but require at least two weeks after immunization for the development of protective immunity.
5817,These vaccines do not induce protective responses quickly enough to blunt the effects of infection when administered after exposure.
5818,We have developed a novel vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus which expresses the influenza hemagglutinin (rVSV HA) and protects mice from lethal influenza challenge when the vaccine is administered intramuscularly at least 24 hours after delivery of the influenza challenge virus.
5819,To our knowledge this is the first vaccine that effectively protects animals from lethal influenza challenge when delivered by a systemic route after influenza exposure has occurred.
5820,"The induction of HA-specific immune responses by the vaccine is necessary for full protection from challenge, because animals immunized with an empty rVSV vector were not protected equally."
5821,"Our results are consistent with a model in which vaccination induces an immediate antiviral cytokine response, followed by development of humoral and cellular immune responses which act to reduce pulmonary viral loads and accelerate recovery."
5822,"Consistent with this model, mice vaccinated with the specific vaccine rVSV HA had high levels of IFN-α in the serum by 24 hours after challenge/vaccination, developed serum neutralizing Ab to influenza two days prior to control animals, and had detectable anti-HA CD8 T cells present in the peripheral blood three days prior to control mice."

5825,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks on pig farms have caused significant economic loss in the swine industry since it was first reported in Thailand a decade ago.
5826,"Anecdotal evidence suggests that PEDV is now endemic in this region, therefore genome information of circulating PEDV is important for molecular surveillance and evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination."
5827,"Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016."
5828,"Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the spike (S) gene, 153 PEDV-positive samples were further subjected to analysis of the open reading frame 3 and nucleocapsid (N) genes."
5829,Comparison of 95 samples in which nucleotide sequencing was successfully obtained for all three genes revealed evolutionary diversity among the Thai PEDV strains.
5830,"Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China."
5831,"Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein."
5832,The PEDV sequence divergence may be responsible for driving periodic outbreaks and continued persistence of PEDV on commercial swine farms.
5833,"Our findings provide important insight into regional PEDV strains in circulation, which may assist future inclusions of suitable strains for future PEDV vaccines."
5834, We summarize findings of SARS-CoV infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees.
5835,New findings are reported on SARS-CoV replication and associated pathology in two additional strains (C57BL/6 and 129S6) of aged mice.
5836,We also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden Syrian hamsters with various SARS-CoV strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge.
5837,"Finally, we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with SARS-CoV."
5838, Live attenuated recombinant measles viruses (rMV) expressing a codon-optimised spike glycoprotein (S) or nucleocapsid protein (N) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were generated (rMV-S and rMV-N).
5839,"Both recombinant viruses stably expressed the corresponding SARS-CoV proteins, grew to similar end titres as the parental strain and induced high antibody titres against MV and the vectored SARS-CoV antigens (S and N) in transgenic mice susceptible to measles infection."
5840,The antibodies induced by rMV-S had a high neutralising effect on SARS-CoV as well as on MV.
5841,"Moreover, significant N-specific cellular immune responses were measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT assays."
5842,The pre-existence of anti-MV antibodies induced by the initial immunisation dose did not inhibit boost of anti-S and anti-N antibodies.
5843,Immunisations comprising a mixture of rMV-S and rMV-N induced immune responses similar in magnitude to that of vaccine components administered separately.
5844,These data support the suitability of MV as a bivalent candidate vaccine vector against MV and emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV.
5845," Nucleocapsid protein plays a critical role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, and high-level anti-nucleocapsid antibodies are detected in the patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)."
5846,Several studies have shown that there exists an interaction between nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) protein.
5847,"In this paper, we investigate whether the expression of membrane protein can affect the immune responses induced by nucleocapsid DNA immunization."
5848,Two recombinant plasmids containing M and N coding sequence were constructed.
5849,"Moreover, in order to get the antigen for ELISA and in vitro stimulation assay, N protein were expressed and purified from E. coli bacteria."
5850,Injection of 20μg of the mixture of pVAX1-M and pVAX1-N into the Balb/c mice could elicit the humoral and cellular responses.
5851,"The ELISA analysis using the N antigen or inactivated SARS-CoV particles as capture antigen showed that co-injection of SARS-M could enhance N-induced antibody production, especially IgG2a subclass."
5852,"After lymphocytes were stimulated with 10μg/ml purified N antigen, The CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of N and M plus N group were increased compared with those of control groups, and the M protein could augment the activation of lymphocytes induced by N DNA vaccine."
5853,"Cytokine ELISA analysis revealed that co-injection of M could enhance the levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 release induced by N antigen."
5854,Further experiments in field mouse also support the claim that membrane protein can augment the N-specific immune responses.
5855,"Virus challenge test was conducted in BSL3 bio safety laboratory with Brandt's vole SARS-CoV model, and the results indicated that co-immunization of M and N antigens could reduce the mortality and pathological changes in lung from the virus infection."
5856, Recombinant measles viruses (rMV) based on the live attenuated measles vaccine strain (MVb) expressing antigens of HIV-1 clade B were generated by reverse genetics.
5857,Recombinants expressing single or double antigens of HIV-1 (rMV-HIV) were genetically highly stable on human diploid cells.
5858,"The production process of these viruses was essentially similar to the parental MV strain, yielding comparative end titers."
5859,Immunization of tg-mice by different regimens and formulations showed potent humoral and cellular immune responses against MV and HIV antigens.
5860,Recombinant MV-HIV expressing Gag protein conferred protective immunity in tg-mice after a high-dose pseudochallenge with recombinant vaccinia virus.
5861,"In addition, rMV-HIV boosted anti-HIV antibodies, in the presence of pre-existing anti-vector antibodies."
5862,Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to a satisfactory result.
5863,Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunotherapies may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence.
5864,"Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients did not result in effective control of HBV infection, suggesting that new formulations of therapeutic vaccines are needed."
5865,The woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a useful preclinical model for developing the new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections.
5866,"Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments with nucleos(t)ide analogues, DNA vaccines, and protein vaccines were tested in the woodchuck model."
5867,"In this paper we summarize the available data concerning therapeutic immunization and gene therapy using recombinant viral vectors approaches in woodchucks, which show encouraging results."
5868,"In addition, we present potential innovations in immunomodulatory strategies to be evaluated in this animal model."
5869,"As part of the World Health Organization (WHO) R&D Blueprint initiative, leading stakeholders on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) convened to agree on strategic public-health goals and global priority research activities that are needed to combat MERS-CoV."
5870,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nm.4131) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
5871,"Live attenuated cold-adapted (ca) H5N1, H7N3, H6N1, and H9N2 influenza vaccine viruses replicated in the respiratory tract of mice and ferrets, and 2 doses of vaccines were immunogenic and protected these animals from challenge infection with homologous and heterologous wild-type (wt) viruses of the corresponding subtypes."
5872,"However, when these vaccine candidates were evaluated in phase I clinical trials, there were inconsistencies between the observations in animal models and in humans."
5873,"The vaccine viruses did not replicate well and immune responses were variable in humans, even though the study subjects were seronegative with respect to the vaccine viruses before vaccination."
5874,"Therefore, we sought a model that would better reflect the findings in humans and evaluated African green monkeys (AGMs) as a nonhuman primate model."
5875,The distribution of sialic acid (SA) receptors in the respiratory tract of AGMs was similar to that in humans.
5876,"We evaluated the replication of wt and ca viruses of avian influenza (AI) virus subtypes H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 in the respiratory tract of AGMs."
5877,"All of the wt viruses replicated efficiently, while replication of the ca vaccine viruses was restricted to the upper respiratory tract."
5878,"Interestingly, the patterns and sites of virus replication differed among the different subtypes."
5879,"We also evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 ca vaccines."
5880,Protection from wt virus challenge correlated well with the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.
5881,Immune responses were slightly better when vaccine was delivered by both intranasal and intratracheal delivery than when it was delivered intranasally by sprayer.
5882,We conclude that live attenuated pandemic influenza virus vaccines replicate similarly in AGMs and human subjects and that AGMs may be a useful model to evaluate the replication of ca vaccine candidates.
5883,IMPORTANCE Ferrets and mice are commonly used for preclinical evaluation of influenza vaccines.
5884,"However, we observed significant inconsistencies between observations in humans and in these animal models."
5885,We used African green monkeys (AGMs) as a nonhuman primate (NHP) model for a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of pairs of wild-type and pandemic live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (pLAIV) representing four subtypes of avian influenza viruses and found that pLAIVs replicate similarly in AGMs and humans and that AGMs can be useful for evaluation of the protective efficacy of pLAIV.
5886,Limited information is available on the transmission and spread of influenza virus in pig populations with differing immune statuses.
5887,In this study we assessed differences in transmission patterns and quantified the spread of a triple reassortant H1N1 influenza virus in naïve and vaccinated pig populations by estimating the reproduction ratio (R) of infection (i.e.
5888,"the number of secondary infections caused by an infectious individual) using a deterministic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, fitted on experimental data."
5889,"One hundred and ten pigs were distributed in ten isolated rooms as follows: (i) non-vaccinated (NV), (ii) vaccinated with a heterologous vaccine (HE), and (iii) vaccinated with a homologous inactivated vaccine (HO)."
5890,"The study was run with multiple replicates and for each replicate, an infected non-vaccinated pig was placed with 10 contact pigs for two weeks and transmission of influenza evaluated daily by analyzing individual nasal swabs by RT-PCR."
5891,A statistically significant difference between R estimates was observed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs (p < 0.05).
5892,"A statistically significant reduction in transmission was observed in the vaccinated groups where R (95%CI) was 1 (0.39-2.09) and 0 for the HE and the HO groups respectively, compared to an R(o )value of 10.66 (6.57-16.46) in NV pigs (p < 0.05)."
5893,Transmission in the HE group was delayed and variable when compared to the NV group and transmission could not be detected in the HO group.
5894,Results from this study indicate that influenza vaccines can be used to decrease susceptibility to influenza infection and decrease influenza transmission.
5895,"Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) is the causative pathogen of plague, a highly fatal disease for which an effective vaccine, especially against mucosal transmission, is still not available."
5896,"Like many bacterial infections, antigen-specific antibody responses have been traditionally considered critical, if not solely responsible, for vaccine-induced protection against Y. pestis."
5897,Studies in recent years have suggested the importance of T cell immune responses against Y. pestis infection but information is still limited about the details of Y. pestis antigen-specific T cell immune responses.
5898,"In current report, studies are conducted to identify the presence of CD8+ T cell epitopes in LcrV protein, the leading antigen of plague vaccine development."
5899,"Furthermore, depletion of CD8+ T cells in LcrV DNA vaccinated Balb/C mice led to reduced protection against lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis."
5900,These findings establish that an LcrV DNA vaccine is able to elicit CD8+ T cell immune responses against specific epitopes of this key plague antigen and that a CD8+ T cell immune response is involved in LcrV DNA vaccine-elicited protection.
5901,"Future studies in plague vaccine development will need to examine if the presence of detectable T cell immune responses, in particular CD8+ T-cell immune responses, will enhance the protection against Y. pestis in higher animal species or humans."
5902, Vaccination continues to be the main approach to protect animals from infectious diseases.
5903,"Until recently, all licensed vaccines were developed using conventional technologies."
5904,"Subunit vaccines are, however, gaining attention from researchers in the field of veterinary vaccinology, and among these, virus-like particles (VLPs) represent one of the most appealing approaches."
5905,VLPs are robust protein cages in the nanometer range that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome.
5906,They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety.
5907,VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities.
5908,"In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens."
5909,VLPs have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines.
5910,"Here, we review the current status of VLPs as a vaccine technology in the veterinary field, and discuss the potential advantages and challenges of this technology."
5911,Emerging pathogens are either new or newly recognized or those that are increasing in incidence and spread.
5912,"Since the identity of emerging pathogens from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict, the development for pathogen-specific therapeutics and vaccines is problematic."
5913,The highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
5914,Many patients with SARS-CoV experienced an exacerbated form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died.
5915,"Similar to other viral pathogens like influenza and West Nile Virus, the severity of SARS-CoV disease increased with age."
5916,"Unfortunately, successful vaccination in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of immunological deficiencies associated with aging (immune senescence)."
5917,"Due to the rapidity of virus emergence, technologies like synthetic biology can be harnessed to facilitate rapid recombinant virus construction for studying the novel virus biology, pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions."
5918,"Since predicting the antigenic identity of future emergence is difficult, candidate vaccines and therapeutics should have a maximal breadth of cross-protection, and panels of antigenically divergent synthetically reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation."
5919,We discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human SARS-CoV has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogenesis of viral diseases.
5920,"In addition, we review the evolution, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of epidemic and zoonotic SARS-CoV with focus on the development of broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines that protect aged populations from the zoonotic pool."
5921,"With an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains, new strategies are required to prepare for the next emergent coronavirus (CoV)."
5922,"Previously, groups had targeted conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current and future CoVs."
5923,"With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a conserved 2’O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against future emergent strains."
5924,"Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential for reversion to pathogenesis."
5925,"Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach."
5926,"However, combining a 2’O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and no evidence for reversion."
5927,"Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2’O MTase in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.SignificanceEmergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks."
5928,"However, failure of many previous CoV vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised."
5929,"This study illustrates that despite success in young models, the NSP16 mutant carries too much risk for pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy."
5930,"Importantly, the NSP16 mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations."
5931,"Coupled with increased safety and reduced pathogenesis, the study highlights the potential for NSP16 attenuation as a major component of future live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines."
5932,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children worldwide.
5933,Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is one of the most prevalent nutrition-related health problems in the world and is a significant risk factor in the development of severe respiratory infections in infants and young children.
5934,Bovine RSV (BRSV) is a primary cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young cattle.
5935,The calf model of BRSV infection is useful to understand the immune response to human RSV infection.
5936,"We have previously developed an amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccine (i.e., nanovaccine) encapsulating the fusion and attachment proteins from BRSV (BRSV-NP)."
5937,"Calves receiving a single, intranasal dose of the BRSV-NP vaccine are partially protected from BRSV challenge."
5938,"Here, we evaluated the impact of VAD on the immune response to the BRSV-NP vaccine and subsequent challenge with BRSV."
5939,"Our results show that VAD calves are unable to respond to the mucosal BRSV-NP vaccine, are afforded no protection from BRSV challenge and have significant abnormalities in the inflammatory response in the infected lung."
5940,"We further show that acute BRSV infection negatively impacts serum and liver retinol, rendering even well-nourished individuals susceptible to VAD."
5941,Our results support the use of the calf model for elucidating the impact of nutritional status on mucosal immunity and respiratory viral infection in infants and underline the importance of VA in regulating immunity in the respiratory mucosa.
5942,"The outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) previously in Middle East and recently in South Korea have raised serious concerns world-wide, reinforcing the importance of developing effective and safe vaccines against MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
5943,"A number of vaccine candidates have been developed on the basis of viral vectors, recombinant proteins, DNAs, nanoparticles, and recombinant MERS-CoV, and some of them have shown efficacy in laboratory animals."
5944,"However, the paucity of financial support has made it difficult to transfer effective candidates from the preclinical stage to clinical trials."
5945,"Here, we summarize currently available MERS vaccine candidates and illustrate strategies for future development, with the aim of provoking government agencies and Big Pharma to invest more funds for developing efficacious and safe MERS vaccines."
5946,Vaccination is one of the cheapest health-care interventions that have saved more lives than any other drugs or therapies.
5947,Due to successful immunization programs we rarely hear about some of the common diseases of the early twentieth century including small pox and polio.
5948,"Vaccination programs have also helped to increase food production notably poultry, cattle, and milk production due to lower incidence of infectious diseases in farm animals."
5949,Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines.
5950,"Currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, and parasitic diseases including malaria."
5951,Abuse of antibiotics has resulted in the generation of several antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains; hence there is a need to develop novel vaccines for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
5952,Changes in climate is another concern for vaccinologists.
5953,Climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines.
5954,Use of conventional vaccination strategies to develop vaccines has severe limitations; hence innovative strategies are essential in the development of novel and effective vaccines.
5955,An alarming increase in emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogens worldwide has become a serious threat to our ability to treat infectious diseases according to the World Health Organization.
5956,"Extensive use of antibiotics by livestock producers promotes the spread of new resistant strains, some of zoonotic concern, which increases food-borne illness in humans and causes significant economic burden on healthcare systems."
5957,"Furthermore, consumer preferences for meat/poultry/fish produced without the use of antibiotics shape today’s market demand."
5958,"So, it is viewed as inevitable by the One Health Initiative that humans need to reduce the use of antibiotics and turn to alternative, improved means to control disease: vaccination and prophylactics."
5959,"Besides the intense research focused on novel therapeutic molecules, both these strategies rely heavily on the availability of cost-effective, efficient and scalable production platforms which will allow large-volume manufacturing for vaccines, antibodies and other biopharmaceuticals."
5960,"Within this context, plant-based platforms for production of recombinant therapeutic proteins offer significant advantages over conventional expression systems, including lack of animal pathogens, low production costs, fast turnaround and response times and rapid, nearly-unlimited scalability."
5961,"Also, because dried leaves and seeds can be stored at room temperature for lengthy periods without loss of recombinant proteins, plant expression systems have the potential to offer lucrative benefits from the development of edible vaccines and prophylactics, as these would not require “cold chain” storage and transportation, and could be administered in mass volumes with minimal processing."
5962,Several biotechnology companies currently have developed and adopted plant-based platforms for commercial production of recombinant protein therapeutics.
5963,"In this manuscript, we outline the challenges in the process of livestock immunization as well as the current plant biotechnology developments aimed to address these challenges."
5964, The development of strategies to augment the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is critical for improving their clinical utility.
5965,One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines.
5966,"In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model."
5967,The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response.
5968,Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response.
5969,"In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production."
5970,These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immunization.
5971,"In addition, our results also show that the delivery of DNA vaccines by electroporation and orally using live-attenuated Salmonella in vivo is an effective method to increase the immune responses."
5972,Further studies could be carried out using a combination strategy of both oral and electroporation immunizations to stimulate higher cellular and humoral immune responses.
5973,": Felid herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) causes upper respiratory tract diseases in cats worldwide, including nasal and ocular discharge, conjunctivitis and oral ulceration."
5974,The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases.
5975,"Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity."
5976,"This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia."
5977,"Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination."
5978,"RESULTS: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years."
5979,Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0–0.01 %) between the isolates.
5980,"No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates."
5981,"No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist."
5982,Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals.
5983,CONCLUSIONS: The results show that FHV-1 genomes are highly conserved.
5984,The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses.
5985,The SNPs detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of FHV-1 in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies.
5986,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-3050-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
5987,Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) is currently under evaluation as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine vector.
5988,"The most compelling reasons to develop rVSV as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans, the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells, and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture."
5989,"Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform."
5990,"When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant."
5991,"However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in NHPs indicated that these prototypic rVSV vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations."
5992,"To address this safety concern, a variety of different attenuation strategies, designed to produce a range of further attenuated rVSV vectors, are currently under investigation."
5993,Additional modifications of further attenuated rVSV vectors to upregulate expression of HIV-1 antigens and coexpress molecular adjuvants are also being developed in an effort to balance immunogenicity and attenuation.
5994, Cereal commodities are frequently contaminated with mycotoxins produced by the secondary metabolism of fungal infection.
5995,"Among these contaminants, deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide."
5996,Pigs are very sensitive to the toxic effects of DON and are frequently exposed to naturally contaminated feed.
5997,"Recently, DON naturally contaminated feed has been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) specific antibody responses following experimental infection."
5998,The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with PRRSV live attenuated vaccine.
5999,"Eighteen pigs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 6 animals based on DON content of the diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5mg DON/kg)."
6000,They were fed these rations one week prior to the vaccination and for all the duration of the immune response evaluation.
6001,All pigs were vaccinated intra-muscularly with one dose of Ingelvac® PRRSV modified live vaccine (MLV).
6002,"Blood samples were collected at day −1, 6, 13, 20, 27 and 35 post vaccination (pv) and tested for PRRSV RNA by RT-qPCR and for virus specific antibodies by ELISA."
6003,Results showed that ingestion of DON-contaminated diets significantly decreased PRRSV viremia.
6004,"All pigs fed control diet were viremic while only 1 (17%) and 3 (50%) out of 6 pigs were viremic in the groups receiving 3.5 and 2.5mg of DON/kg, respectively."
6005,"Subsequently, all pigs fed control diet developed PRRSV specific antibodies while only viremic pigs that were fed contaminated diets have developed PRRSV specific antibodies."
6006,These results suggest that feeding pigs with DON-contaminated diet could inhibit vaccination efficiency of PRRSV MLV by severely impairing viral replication.
6007,Large and innovative research programs are underway to define the immune parameters for vaccines against a wide array of pathogens considered to represent a potential bioterrorist threat.
6008,"However, the development and utilization of such vaccines presents a number of predicaments that have not previously been addressed by the field of vaccinology."
6009,"Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a severe tick-borne disease, endemic in many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia."
6010,Between 15–70% of reported cases are fatal.
6011,"There is no approved vaccine available, and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccine has not been demonstrated previously."
6012,"In the present study, the attenuated poxvirus vector, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus glycoproteins."
6013,"Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in two mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease."
6014,This vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite.
6015,"Histopathology and viral load analysis of protected animals confirmed that they had been exposed to challenge virus, even though they did not exhibit clinical signs."
6016,This is the first demonstration of efficacy of a CCHF vaccine.
6017,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection represents one of the major health threats in the developing world.
6018,The costly treatment of infected individuals with multiple highly efficient anti-HIV drugs is only affordable in industrialized countries.
6019,"Thus, an efficient vaccination strategy is required to prevent the further spread of the infection."
6020,The molecular biology of coronaviruses and particular features of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) indicate that HCoV 229E-based vaccine vectors can become a new class of highly efficient vaccines.
6021,"First, the receptor of HCoV 229E, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN or CD13) is expressed mainly on human dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages indicating that targeting of HCoV 229E-based vectors to professional antigen presenting cells can be achieved by receptor-mediated transduction."
6022,"Second, HCoV 229E structural genes can be replaced by multiple transcriptional units encoding various antigens."
6023,These virus-like particles (VLPs) containing HCoV 229E-based vector RNA have the ability to transduce human DCs and to mediate heterologous gene expression in these cells.
6024,"Finally, coronavirus infections are associated with mainly respiratory and enteric diseases, and natural transmission of coronaviruses occurs via mucosal surfaces."
6025,"In humans, HCoV 229E causes common cold by infecting the upper respiratory tract."
6026,HCoV 229E infections are mainly encountered in children and re-infection occurs frequently in adults.
6027,It is thus most likely that pre-existing immunity against HCoV 229E will not significantly impact on the vaccination efficiency if HCoV 229E-based vectors are used in humans.
6028,"The possible bioterrorism threat using the variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, has promoted us to further investigate the immunogenicity profiles of existing vaccines."
6029,"Here, we study for the first time the immunogenicity profile of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine (vaccinia Tiantan, VTT strain) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) through mucosal vaccination, which is noninvasive and has a critical implication for massive vaccination programs."
6030,Four different routes of vaccination were tested in parallel including intramuscular (i.m.
6031,"), intranasal (i.n."
6032,"), oral (i.o."
6033,"), and subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculations in mice."
6034,We found that one time vaccination with an optimal dose of VTT was able to induce anti-VTT Nabs via each of the four routes.
6035,"Higher levels of antiviral Nabs, however, were induced via the i.n."
6036,and i.o.
6037,inoculations when compared with the i.m.
6038,and s.c. routes.
6039,"Moreover, the i.n."
6040,and i.o.
6041,"vaccinations also induced higher sustained levels of Nabs overtime, which conferred better protections against homologous or alternating mucosal routes of viral challenges six months post vaccination."
6042,"The VTT-induced immunity via all four routes, however, was partially effective against the intramuscular viral challenge."
6043,Our data have implications for understanding the potential application of mucosal smallpox vaccination and for developing VTT-based vaccines to overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity.
6044,Nipah virus (NiV) continues to cause outbreaks of fatal human encephalitis due to spillover from its bat reservoir.
6045,We determined that a single dose of replication-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine vectors expressing either the NiV fusion (F) or attachment (G) glycoproteins protected hamsters from over 1000 times LD(50) NiV challenge.
6046,This highly effective single-dose protection coupled with an enhanced safety profile makes these candidates ideal for potential use in livestock and humans.
6047," Ebola virus (EBOV) infections cause lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans, resulting in up to 90% mortality."
6048,"EBOV outbreaks are sporadic and unpredictable in nature; therefore, a vaccine that is able to provide durable immunity is needed to protect those who are at risk of exposure to the virus."
6049,This study assesses the long-term efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine (VSVΔG/EBOVGP) in two rodent models of EBOV infection.
6050,"Mice and guinea pigs were first immunized with 2×104 or 2×105 plaque forming units (PFU) of VSVΔG/EBOVGP, respectively."
6051,"Challenge of mice with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination provided complete protection, and 80% (12 of 15 survivors) protection at 12 months after vaccination."
6052,"Challenge of guinea pigs with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (GA-EBOV) at 7, 12 and 18 months after vaccination resulted in 83% (5 of 6 survivors) at 7 months after vaccination, and 100% survival at 12 and 18 months after vaccination."
6053,No weight loss or clinical signs were observed in the surviving animals.
6054,Antibody responses were analyzed using sera from individual rodents.
6055,Levels of EBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG antibody measured immediately before challenge appeared to correlate with protection.
6056,"These studies confirm that vaccination with VSVΔG/EBOVGP is able to confer long-term protection against Ebola infection in mice and guinea pigs, and support follow-up studies in non-human primates."
6057," The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but the prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV is still under investigation."
6058,"We constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing a truncated N-terminal fragment of the SARS-CoV Spike (S) gene (from −45 to 1469, designated Ad-SN), which encoded a truncated S protein (490 amino-acid residues, a part of 672 amino-acid S1 subunit), and investigated whether this construct could induce effective immunity against SARS-CoV in Wistar rats."
6059,Rats were immunized either subcutaneously or intranasally with Ad-SN once a week for three consecutive weeks.
6060,"Our results showed that all of the immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV spike protein, and the sera of immunized rats showed strong capable of protecting from SARS-CoV infection in vitro."
6061,Histopathological examination did not find evident side effects in the immunized animals.
6062,"These results indicate that an adenoviral-based vaccine carrying an N-terminal fragment of the Spike gene is able to elicit strong SARS-CoV-specific humoral immune responses in rats, and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection."
6063," The study objectives were: 1) to characterise the development of immunocompetence in beef suckler calves from birth to three months of age, and 2) to trace glycoprotein E (gE)-negative bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) antibodies from dam to calf and subsequent vaccination against pneumonia."
6064,"Thirty multiparous beef suckler, spring-calving cows, consisting of two genotypes were involved; Limousin×Friesian (LF) and Charolais×Limousin (CL)."
6065,Cows were immunised against the inactivated antigen strain of BoHV-1 (gE- (IBR marker vaccine) at day −84 and received a booster at day −56 relative to the expected calving date (d 0).
6066,"Calves were immunised at 14 and 42days of age against PI-3 virus, BRSV and Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica serotype A1 using a commercial vaccine administered subcutaneously."
6067,"Additionally, calves were immunised against BoHV-1 at 42days of age, using 1 dose of a live commercial vaccine administered intranasally."
6068,"Blood samples were collected from all calves (n=30) via jugular venipuncture at birth, prior to colostrum feeding (0h), at 12h (h), 24h, 72h and 168h after the initial feeding of colostrum, and at d 7, 14, 28, 42, 56 and 84 post birth."
6069,The mean ratio of gE negative antibodies circulating in the blood of LF and CL dams pre-partum scored negative to gE ab (S/N≥0.70).
6070,"Antibody levels of BoHV-1 (wild type (wt)) peaked at 12h post-birth in calves and declined thereafter, as the maternal antibodies decayed."
6071,There was no difference in BoHV-1 and BRSV antibody levels in calves post vaccination.
6072,"Plant-derived biologicals for use in animal health are becoming an increasingly important target for research into alternative, improved methods for disease control."
6073,"Although there are no commercial products on the market yet, the development and testing of oral, plant-based vaccines is now beyond the proof-of-principle stage."
6074,"Vaccines, such as those developed for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, have the potential to stimulate both mucosal and systemic, as well as, lactogenic immunity as has already been seen in target animal trials."
6075,"Plants are a promising production system, but they must compete with existing vaccines and protein production platforms."
6076,"In addition, regulatory hurdles will need to be overcome, and industry and public acceptance of the technology are important in establishing successful products."
6077," Canine non-rabies combined vaccines are widely used to protect animals from infectious agents, and also play an important role in public health."
6078,"We performed a large-scale survey to investigate vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs), including anaphylaxis, in Japan by distributing questionnaires on VAAEs to veterinary hospitals from April 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007."
6079,"Valid responses were obtained for 57,300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals; we obtained VAAEs information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital."
6080,"We found that of the 57,300, 359 dogs showed VAAEs."
6081,"Of the 359 dogs, death was observed in 1, anaphylaxis in 41, dermatological signs in 244, gastrointestinal signs in 160, and other signs in 106."
6082,"Onset of VAAEs was mostly observed within 12h after vaccination (n =299, 83.3%)."
6083,"In this study, anaphylaxis events occurred within 60min after vaccination, and about half of these events occurred within 5min (n =19, 46.3%)."
6084,"Furthermore, where anaphylaxis was reported, additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation."
6085,"Our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs; 27 of these demonstrated collapse (87.1%), 24 demonstrated cyanosis (77.4%), and both signs occurred in 22 (71.0%)."
6086,"Higher rates of animal VAAEs, anaphylaxis, and death were found in Japan than in other countries."
6087,"Further investigations, including survey studies, will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for VAAEs, and thus develop safer vaccines."
6088,"Moreover, it may also be necessary to continually update the data of VAAEs."
6089," In this study, we infected NOD/Scid/Jak3null mice engrafted human peripheral blood leukocytes (hu-PBL-NOJ) with measles virus Edmonston B strain (MV-Edm) expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope proteins (rMV-E1E2) to evaluate the immunogenicity as a vaccine candidate."
6090,"Although human leukocytes could be isolated from the spleen of mock-infected mice during the 2-weeks experiment, the proportion of engrafted human leukocytes in mice infected with MV (103–105 pfu) or rMV-E1E2 (104 pfu) was decreased."
6091,Viral infection of the splenocytes was confirmed by the development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in co-cultures of splenocytes and B95a cells and verified using RT-PCR.
6092,"Finally, human antibodies against MV were more frequently observed than E2-specific antibodies in serum from mice infected with a low dose of virus (MV, 100–101 pfu, and rMV-E1E2, 101–102 pfu)."
6093,These results showed the possibility of hu-PBL-NOJ mice for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of viral proteins.
6094,"The TNF-α biological inhibitors have significantly improved the clinical outcomes of many autoimmune diseases, in particular rheumatoid arthritis."
6095,"However, the practical uses are limited due to high costs and the risk of anti-drug antibody responses."
6096,"Attempts to develop anti-TNF-α vaccines have generated encouraging data in animal models, however, data from clinical trials have not met expectations."
6097,"In present study, we designed a TNF-α epitope-scaffold immunogen DTNF7 using the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, named DTT as a scaffold."
6098,"Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the grafted TNF-α epitope is entirely surface-exposed and presented in a native-like conformation while the rigid helical structure of DTT is minimally perturbed, thereby rendering the immunogen highly stable."
6099,"Immunization of mice with alum formulated DTNF7 induced humoral responses against native TNF-α, and the antibody titer was sustained for more than 6 months, which supports a role of the universal CD4 T cell epitopes of DTT in breaking self-immune tolerance."
6100,"In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, DTNF7-alum vaccination markedly delayed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, and reduced incidence as well as clinical score."
6101,"DTT is presumed safe as an epitope carrier because a catalytic inactive mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197 has good clinical safety records as an active vaccine component."
6102,"Taken all together, we show that DTT-based epitope vaccine is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases."
6103,"The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two strains of animal coronaviruses that crossed the species barrier to infect and cause severe respiratory infections in humans within the last 12 years, have taught us that coronaviruses represent a global threat that does not recognize international borders."
6104,We can expect to see other novel coronaviruses emerge in the future.
6105,"An ideal animal model should reflect the clinical signs, viral replication and pathology seen in humans."
6106,"In this review, we present factors to consider in establishing an animal model for the study of novel coronaviruses and compare the different animal models that have been employed to study SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."
6107, A new type of coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent underlying Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
6108,"The MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has spread in the Middle East, but cases originating in the Middle East have also occurred in the European Union and the USA."
6109,"Eight hundred and thirty-seven cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed to date, including 291 deaths."
6110,"MERS-CoV has infected dromedary camel populations in the Middle East at high rates, representing an immediate source of human infection."
6111,"The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered as a key target of vaccines against coronavirus infection."
6112,"In an initial attempt to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine to ultimately target dromedary camels, we constructed two recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding the full-length MERS-CoV S protein (Ad5.MERS-S) and the S1 extracellular domain of S protein (Ad5.MERS-S1)."
6113,BALB/c mice were immunized with both candidate vaccines intramuscularly and boosted three weeks later intranasally.
6114,"All the vaccinated animals had antibody responses against spike protein, which neutralized MERS-CoV in vitro."
6115,"These results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine can induce MERS-CoV-specific immune responses in mice and hold promise for the development of a preventive vaccine that targets the animal reservoir, which might be an effective measure to eliminate transmission of MERS-CoV to humans."
6116, The ongoing battle against current and rising viral infectious threats has prompted increasing effort in the development of vaccine technology.
6117,A major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing.
6118,"Herein, a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles."
6119,"Using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen, sVLPs were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins."
6120,"Following removal of free proteins, antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy."
6121,"As compared to inoculation with free proteins, vaccination with the sVLPs showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery, stronger antibody titers, increased splenic T-cell response, and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection."
6122,Comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the sVLPs.
6123,The study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application; it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture.
6124, It is believed today that nucleocapsid protein (N) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV is one of the most promising antigen candidates for vaccine design.
6125,"In this study, three fragments [N1 (residues: 1–422); N2 (residues: 1–109); N3 (residues: 110–422)] of N protein of SARS-CoV were expressed in Escherichia coli and analyzed by pooled sera of convalescence phase of SARS patients."
6126,"Three gene fragments [N1 (1–1269 nt), N2 (1–327 nt) and N3 (328–1269 nt)—expressing the same proteins of N1, N2 and N3, respectively] of SARS-N were cloned into pVAX-1 and used to immunize BALB/c mice by electroporation."
6127,"Humoral (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) and cellular (by cell proliferation and CD4+:CD8+ assay) immunity was detected by using recombinant N1 and N3 specific antigen."
6128,Results showed that N1 and N3 fragments of N protein expressed by E. coli were able to react with sera of SARS patients but N2 could not.
6129,Specific humoral and cellular immunity in mice could be induced significantly by inoculating SARS-CoV N1 and N3 DNA vaccine.
6130,"In addition, the immune response levels in N3 were significantly higher for antibody responses (IgG and IgG1 but not IgG2a) and cell proliferation but not in CD4+:CD8+ assay compared to N1 vaccine."
6131,The identification of antigenic N protein fragments has implications to provide basic information for the design of DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV.
6132,"The present results not only suggest that DNA immunization with pVax-N3 could be used as potential DNA vaccination approaches to induce antibody in BALB/c mice, but also illustrates that gene immunization with these SARS DNA vaccines can generate different immune responses."
6133,"To combat the threat of many emerging infectious diseases, DNA immunization offers a unique and powerful approach to the production of high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against various pathogens."
6134,"Compared with traditional protein-based immunization approaches, DNA immunization is efficient for testing novel immunogen designs, does not require the production or purification of proteins from a pathogen or the use of recombinant protein technology and is effective at generating mAbs against conformation-sensitive targets."
6135,"Although significant progress in the use of DNA immunization to generate mAbs has been made over the last two decades, the literature does not contain an updated summary of this experience."
6136,"The current review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature, including our own work, describing the use of DNA immunization to produce highly functional mAbs, in particular, those against emerging infectious diseases."
6137,"Critical factors such as immunogen design, delivery approach, immunization schedule, use of immune modulators and the role of final boost immunization are discussed in detail."
6138,"Both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza are acute, highly contagious swine diseases."
6139,These diseases pose severe threats for the swine industry and cause heavy economic losses worldwide.
6140,"In this study, we have developed a chimeric virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and H3N2 influenza virus and investigated its immunogenicity in mice."
6141,The HA and M1 proteins from the H3N2 influenza virus and the PRRSV GP5 protein fused to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the NA protein were both incorporated into the chimeric VLPs.
6142,"Analysis of the immune responses showed that the chimeric VLPs elicited serum antibodies specific for both PRRSV GP5 and the H3N2 HA protein, and they stimulated cellular immune responses compared to the responses to equivalent amounts of inactivated viruses."
6143,"Taken together, the results suggested that the chimeric VLP vaccine represents a potential strategy for the development of a safe and effective vaccine to control PRRSV and H3N2 influenza virus."
6144,Human papilloma virus-like particles (HPV VLP) serve as the basis of the current licensed vaccines for HPV.
6145,We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally.
6146,"Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles."
6147,In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsV-encapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene.
6148,Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge.
6149,"Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively."
6150,HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge.
6151,"In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids."
6152,"Although the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust."
6153,"Taken together, these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation."
6154,Recent global advocacy efforts have highlighted the importance of development of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS).
6155,Combo5 is a non-M protein-based vaccine that provides protection against GAS skin infection in mice and reduces the severity of pharyngitis in nonhuman primates.
6156,"However, Combo5 with the addition of aluminum hydroxide (alum) as an adjuvant failed to protect against invasive GAS infection of mice."
6157,"Here, we show that formulation of Combo5 with adjuvants containing saponin QS21 significantly improves protective efficacy, even though all 7 adjuvants tested generated high antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, including alum."
6158,"Detailed characterization of Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant, a squalene-in-water emulsion containing a TLR4 agonist and QS21, showed significant differences from the results obtained with alum in IgG subclasses generated following immunization, with an absence of GAS opsonizing antibodies."
6159,"SMQ, but not alum, generated strong interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) responses."
6160,This work highlights the importance of adjuvant selection for non-M protein-based GAS vaccines to optimize immune responses and protective efficacy.
6161,"Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis, which may cause significant losses for the livestock sector and have serious public health implications."
6162,"Egypt has been repeatedly affected by RVF epidemics, mainly associated to the importation of animals from sub-Saharan countries, where the disease is endemic."
6163,The objective of our study was the improvement of the surveillance and control strategies implemented in Egypt.
6164,"In order to do that, first we evaluated the legal trade of live animals into and within Egypt."
6165,"Then, we assessed the risk of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) transmission within the country using a multi-criteria evaluation approach."
6166,"Finally, we combined the animal trade and the risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely."
6167,Our results indicate that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of large number of camels coming from Sudan.
6168,"The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile river, and does not vary significantly throughout the year."
6169,"Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low."
6170,"Then, they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher."
6171,"The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination or testing) seem to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction, and therefore other (risk-based) surveillance strategies are proposed."
6172, This article summarizes progress in research on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) since a FAO-OIE-WHO Global Technical Meeting held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva on 25–27 September 2017.
6173,"The meeting reviewed the latest scientific findings and identified and prioritized the global activities necessary to prevent, manage and control the disease."
6174,"Critical needs for research and technical guidance identified during the meeting have been used to update the WHO R&D MERS-CoV Roadmap for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines and a broader public health research agenda."
6175,"Since the 2017 meeting, progress has been made on several key actions in animal populations, at the animal/human interface and in human populations."
6176,"This report also summarizes the latest scientific studies on MERS since 2017, including data from more than 50 research studies examining the presence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels."
6177,Animal models for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection play a key role in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS and the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines.
6178,"As the only lentivirus that causes an immunodeficiency resembling that of HIV infection, in its natural host, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been a unique and powerful model for AIDS research."
6179,"FIV was first described in 1987 by Niels Pedersen and co-workers as the causative agent for a fatal immunodeficiency syndrome observed in cats housed in a cattery in Petaluma, California."
6180,"Since this landmark observation, multiple studies have shown that natural and experimental infection of cats with biological isolates of FIV produces an AIDS syndrome very similar in pathogenesis to that observed for human AIDS."
6181,"FIV infection induces an acute viremia associated with Tcell alterations including depressed CD4 :CD8 T-cell ratios and CD4 T-cell depletion, peripheral lymphadenopathy, and neutropenia."
6182,"In later stages of FIV infection, the host suffers from chronic persistent infections that are typically self-limiting in an immunocompetent host, as well as opportunistic infections, chronic diarrhea and wasting, blood dyscracias, significant CD4 T-cell depletion, neurologic disorders, and B-cell lymphomas."
6183,"Importantly, chronic FIV infection induces a progressive lymphoid and CD4 T-cell depletion in the infected cat."
6184,The primary mode of natural FIV transmission appears to be blood-borne facilitated by fighting and biting.
6185,"However, experimental infection through transmucosal routes (rectal and vaginal mucosa and perinatal) have been well documented for specific FIV isolates."
6186,"Accordingly, FIV disease pathogenesis exhibits striking similarities to that described for HIV-1 infection."
6187," Rabies is one of the most deadly infectious diseases, with a case-fatality rate approaching 100%."
6188,"The disease is established on all continents apart from Antarctica; most cases are reported in Africa and Asia, with thousands of deaths recorded annually."
6189,"However, the estimated annual figure of almost 60 000 human rabies fatalities is probably an underestimate."
6190,Almost all cases of human rabies result from bites from infected dogs.
6191,"Therefore, the most cost-effective approach to elimination of the global burden of human rabies is to control canine rabies rather than expansion of the availability of human prophylaxis."
6192,"Mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines, and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife, have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide."
6193,The subsequent reduction in cases of human rabies in such regions advocates the multidisciplinary One Health approach to rabies control through the mass vaccination of dogs and control of canine populations.
6194,"Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases are major threats to global health, economic stability, and national security."
6195,"Vaccines are key for reducing coronaviral disease burden; however, the utility of live-attenuated vaccines is limited by risks of reversion or repair."
6196,"Because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools, designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness."
6197,"Here, we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) are effective vaccines against SARS-CoV."
6198,The TRN-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge.
6199,"While a 3-nt rewired TRN reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage, a 7-nt rewired TRN is more stable, suggesting that a more extensively rewired TRN might be essential for avoiding growth selection."
6200,"In summary, rewiring the TRN is a feasible strategy for limiting reversion in an effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate that is potentially portable across the Nidovirales order."
6201,: Development an effective vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is urgent and limited information is available on vaccination in nonhuman primate (NHP) model.
6202,We herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model.
6203,"METHODS: Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks)."
6204,Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation.
6205,Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays.
6206,"Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses."
6207,"Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests."
6208,CONCLUSION: Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination.
6209,"Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys."
6210,"Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys."
6211,These data in NHP paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against MERS-CoV infection.
6212,ABSTRACTThe cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease.
6213,"In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed."
6214,"Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein."
6215,"From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively."
6216,"Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values."
6217,"These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores −725.0 Kcal/mole and −786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding."
6218,This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage.
6219,This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also.
6220,"Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study."
6221," An RNA-based, non-cytopathic replicon vector system, based on the flavivirus Kunjin, has shown considerable promise as a new vaccine delivery system."
6222,Here we describe the testing in mice of four different SIVmac239 gag vaccines delivered by Kunjin replicon virus-like-particles.
6223,"The four vaccines encoded the wild type gag gene, an RNA-optimised gag gene, a codon-optimised gag gene and a modified gag-pol gene construct."
6224,"The vaccines behaved quite differently for induction of effector memory and central memory responses, for mediation of protection, and with respect to insert stability, with the SIV gag-pol vaccine providing the optimal performance."
6225,These results illustrate that for an RNA-based vector the RNA sequence of the antigen can have profound and unforeseen consequences on vaccine behaviour.
6226,"Lyssaviruses are bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses and the causative agents of the ancient zoonosis rabies."
6227,"Africa is the likely home to the ancestors of taxa residing within the Genus Lyssavirus, Family Rhabdoviridae."
6228,"Diverse lyssaviruses are envisioned as co-evolving with bats, as the ultimate reservoirs, over seemingly millions of years."
6229,"In terms of relative distribution, overt abundance, and resulting progeny, rabies virus is the most successful lyssavirus species today, but for unknown reasons."
6230,All mammals are believed to be susceptible to rabies virus infection.
6231,"Besides reservoirs among the Chiroptera, meso-carnivores also serve as major historical hosts and are represented among the canids, raccoons, skunks, mongooses, and ferret badgers."
6232,"Perpetuating as a disease of nature with the mammalian central nervous system as niche, host breadth alone precludes any candidacy for true eradication."
6233,"Despite having the highest case fatality of any infectious disease and a burden in excess of or comparative to other major zoonoses, rabies remains neglected."
6234,"Once illness appears, no treatment is proven to prevent death."
6235,"Paradoxically, vaccines were developed more than a century ago, but the clear majority of human cases are unvaccinated."
6236,"Tens of millions of people are exposed to suspect rabid animals and tens of thousands succumb annually, primarily children in developing countries, where canine rabies is enzootic."
6237,"Rather than culling animal populations, one of the most cost-effective strategies to curbing human fatalities is the mass vaccination of dogs."
6238,"Building on considerable progress to date, several complementary actions are needed in the near future, including a more harmonized approach to viral taxonomy, enhanced de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance, focal pathogen discovery and characterization, applied pathobiological research for therapeutics, improved estimates of canine populations at risk, actual production of required vaccines and related biologics, strategies to maximize prevention but minimize unnecessary human prophylaxis, and a long-term, realistic plan for sustained global program support to achieve success in disease control, prevention, and elimination."
6239,The ongoing Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks pose a worldwide public health threat.
6240,"Blocking MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels, the animal reservoir, could potentially reduce the number of primary human cases."
6241,Here we report MERS-CoV transmission from experimentally infected llamas to naïve animals.
6242,Directly inoculated llamas shed virus for at least 6 days and could infect all in-contact naïve animals 4–5 days after exposure.
6243,"With the aim to block virus transmission, we examined the efficacy of a recombinant spike S1-protein vaccine."
6244,"In contrast to naïve animals, in-contact vaccinated llamas did not shed infectious virus upon exposure to directly inoculated llamas, consistent with the induction of strong virus neutralizing antibody responses."
6245,Our data provide further evidence that vaccination of the reservoir host may impede MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission to humans.
6246," The infectious bronchitis virus Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) was observed on a German broiler farm, for the first time."
6247,The animals suffered from respiratory and nephropathogenic disease.
6248,"Gross lesions observed during necropsy included tracheitis, aerosacculitis, and nephritis."
6249,Tracheal swabs were tested positive for infectious bronchitis virus Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) by PCR.
6250,"Furthermore, sequence analysis of the S1 spike protein showed close relationship to the commercially available vaccine TAbic IBVAR206 and polish isolates."
6251,"Newly emerging viruses often circulate as a heterogeneous swarm in wild animal reservoirs prior to their emergence in humans, and their antigenic identities are often unknown until an outbreak situation."
6252,"The newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and reemerging influenza virus cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence."
6253,"To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages."
6254,"From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged."
6255,We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type VEE glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged mice within novel models of severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis.
6256,"Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from SARS-CoV disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not."
6257,The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza virus challenge model.
6258,"While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure."
6259,"Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like West Nile virus, influenza virus, norovirus, or other emerging viruses of the future."
6260,Legumain-based DNA vaccines have potential to protect against breast cancer.
6261,"However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application."
6262,"Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine."
6263,"First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro."
6264,DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs).
6265,"Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH<2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH."
6266,Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer’s patches.
6267,"Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs."
6268,A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control.
6269,Oral vaccination was performed in the murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model.
6270,Our data indicate that tumor volume was significantly smaller in groups using A.C.NPs or attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as carriers.
6271,"Furthermore, splenocytes co-cultured them with 4T1 cells pre-stimulated with CoCl(2), which influenced the translocation of legumain from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, showed a 4.7 and 2.3 folds increase in active cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3(+)/CD8(+)/CD25(+)) when treated with A.C.NPs carriers compared with PBS C.NPs."
6272,Our study suggests that C.NPs coated with alginic acid may be a safe and efficient tool for oral delivery of a DNA vaccine.
6273,"Moreover, a legumain DNA vaccine delivered orally with A.C.NPs can effectively improve autoimmune response and protect against breast cancer in mice."
6274,"In many countries, vaccines are used for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)."
6275,"However, because there is no protection against FMD immediately after vaccination, research and development on antiviral agents is being conducted to induce protection until immunological competence is produced."
6276,This study tested whether well-known chemicals used as RNA virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on FMD viruses (FMDVs) and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against FMDV in vitro/in vivo.
6277,"In addition, it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals."
6278,"Antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines, thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine."
6279,"Finally, pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion."
6280,"Based on these results, it is expected that this combined approach could be a therapeutic and preventive treatment for early protection against FMD."
6281,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has spread through 27 countries and infected more than 2,200 people since its first outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012."
6282,The high fatality rate (35.4%) of this novel coronavirus and its persistent wide spread infectiousness in animal reservoirs have generated tremendous global public health concern.
6283,"However, no licensed therapeutic agents or vaccines against MERS-CoV are currently available and only a limited few have entered clinical trials."
6284,"Among all the potential targets of MERS-CoV, the spike glycoprotein (S) has been the most well-studied due to its critical role in mediating viral entry and in inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals."
6285,The most notable studies include the recent discoveries of monoclonal antibodies and development of candidate vaccines against the S glycoprotein.
6286,Structural characterization of MERS-CoV S protein bound with these monoclonal antibodies has provided insights into the mechanisms of humoral immune responses against MERS-CoV infection.
6287,The current review aims to highlight these developments and discuss possible hurdles and strategies to translate these discoveries into ultimate medical interventions against MERS-CoV infection.
6288,"The 2013 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, as of writing, is declining in reported human cases and mortalities."
6289,"The resulting devastation caused highlights how health systems, in particular in West Africa, and in terms of global pandemic planning, are ill prepared to react to zoonotic pathogens."
6290,In this paper we propose One Health as a strategy to prevent zoonotic outbreaks as a shared goal: that human and Great Ape vaccine trials could benefit both species.
6291,Only recently have two phase 2/3 Ebola human vaccine trials been started in West Africa.
6292,This paper argues for a conceptual change in pandemic preparedness.
6293,We first discuss the ethics of One Health.
6294,"Next, we focus on the current Ebola outbreak and defines its victims."
6295,"Third, we present the notion of a ‘shared benefit’ approach, grounded in One Health, and argue for the vaccination of wild apes in order to protect both apes and humans."
6296,"We believe that a creation of such inter-species immunity is an exemplar of One Health, and that it is worth pursuing as a coextensive public health approach."
6297," Development of effective vaccines, in particular, subunit-based vaccines, against emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) will provide the safest means of preventing the continuous spread of MERS in humans and camels."
6298,"This review briefly describes the structure of the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), discusses the current status of MERS vaccine development and illustrates the strategies used to develop RBD-based subunit vaccines against MERS."
6299,It also summarizes currently available animal models for MERS-CoV and proposes a future direction for MERS vaccines.
6300,"Taken together, this review will assist researchers working to develop effective and safe subunit vaccines against MERS-CoV and any other emerging coronaviruses that might cause future pandemics."
6301,  This chapter discusses various drugs for human influenza A (H5N1) and multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
6302,The H5N1 avian influenza does not presently meet the criteria of an antigenically shifted strain.
6303,It is presently an avian strain that has not undergone reassortment with a human strain and is not well adapted to humans.
6304,H5N1 isolates are resistant to the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine; these antivirals do not have a role for the treatment or prophylaxis against the strain.
6305,"The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, have in vitro activities against the human H5N1 isolates; however, recent data suggest that higher doses for longer periods may be required to be effective."
6306,Oseltamivir is an oral agent approved for prophylaxis and the treatment of influenza infections.
6307,Zanamivir is delivered topically to the respiratory tract with similar indications.
6308,"The drugs discussed in the chapter for MDR-TB fall into three categories—quinolones, nitroimidazoles, and pyrroles."
6309,"Drugs such as moxifloxacin are methoxyfluoroquinolones, which are already available and approved for the treatment of acute respiratory infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, acute sinusitis, and skin infections."
6310,"Gatifloxacin 5, is another methoxyfluoroquinolone that is in clinical development for tuberculosis treatment."
6311,Our study demonstrates the repeated isolation of vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses from different species of wild birds across four continents from 1997 through 2014.
6312,The data indicate that at least 17 species from ten avian orders occupying different habitats excrete vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses.
6313,"The most frequently reported isolates were detected among individuals in the order Columbiformes (n = 23), followed in frequency by the order Anseriformes (n = 13)."
6314,Samples were isolated from both free-ranging (n = 47) and wild birds kept in captivity (n = 7).
6315,"The number of recovered vaccine-derived viruses corresponded with the most widely utilized vaccines, LaSota (n = 28) and Hitchner B1 (n = 19)."
6316,"Other detected vaccine-derived viruses resembled the PHY-LMV2 and V4 vaccines, with five and two cases, respectively."
6317,These results and the ubiquitous and synanthropic nature of wild pigeons highlight their potential role as indicator species for the presence of Newcastle disease virus of low virulence in the environment.
6318,The reverse spillover of live agents from domestic animals to wildlife as a result of the expansion of livestock industries employing massive amounts of live virus vaccines represent an underappreciated and poorly studied effect of human activity on wildlife.
6319,MERS Coronavirus: An Emerging Zoonotic Virus
6320, A decline in protective immune responses following vaccination is one of the main features of immunosenescence.
6321,Improved vaccine candidates for elderly adults are thus urgently needed.
6322,"For scientific and regulatory requirements, such new vaccines must first be evaluated at the preclinical level, and there is a continuing quest for the ideal animal model with which to perform such studies."
6323,"The main advantages and limitations of murine models, those most commonly used for human vaccine research, and of large animal models are reviewed and discussed."
6324,"Although often encoding fewer than a dozen genes, RNA viruses can overcome host antiviral responses and wreak havoc on the cells they infect."
6325,"Some manage to evade host antiviral defences, whereas others elicit an aberrant or disproportional immune response."
6326,Both scenarios can result in the disruption of intracellular signalling pathways and significant pathology in the host.
6327,Systems-biology approaches are increasingly being used to study the processes of viral triggering and regulation of host immune responses.
6328,"By providing a global and integrated view of cellular events, these approaches are beginning to unravel some of the complexities of virus–host interactions and provide new insights into how RNA viruses cause disease."
6329,"In March 2013, a patient infected with a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus was reported in China."
6330,"Since then, there have been 458 confirmed infection cases and 177 deaths."
6331,"The virus contains several human-adapted markers, indicating that H7N9 has pandemic potential."
6332,The outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines.
6333,"Previously, we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of the H5N1 virus (H5N1-M2e) could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses."
6334,"In this study, we investigated the cross-protection of H5N1-M2e against lethal infection with the new H7N9 virus."
6335,"Although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13, 14, 18, 20, and 21 between M2e of H5N1 and H7N9, H5N1-M2e vaccination with either Freund's adjuvant or the Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) induced a high level of anti-M2e antibody, which cross-reacted with H7N9-M2e peptide."
6336,"A mouse-adapted H7N9 strain, A/Anhui/01/2013m, was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments."
6337,H5N1-M2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the H7N9 virus.
6338,Reduced viral replication and histopathological damage of mouse lungs were also observed in the vaccinated mice.
6339,Our results suggest that the tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections.
6340,"Therefore, this vaccine may be an ideal candidate for developing a universal vaccine to prevent the reemergence of avian influenza A H7N9 virus and the emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus."
6341," Five years after the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, several candidate SARS-coronavirus (CoV) vaccines are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development."
6342,"Based on the observation that SARSCoV infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, vaccines containing the S protein have been formulated."
6343,"Animals immunized with inactivated whole virus vaccines or live-recombinant vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (e.g., using rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, or attenuated vaccinia virus MVA as a vector), as well as mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing the S protein gene all developed neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV and were protected against SARS-CoV challenge."
6344,"Although much effort has been focused on developing a SARS vaccine, the commercial viability of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV will ultimately depend on whether the virus re-emerges in the near future."
6345,This vaccine should induce highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to protect against newly emerging viruses related to SARS-CoV and protect both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract in the absence of significant side effects.
6346,"Given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly the elderly succumbed to the infection, special attention should be given to vaccines that are able to efficiently protect aged individuals."
6347, Mucosal immunity establishes the first line of defence against pathogens entering the body via mucosal surfaces.
6348,"Besides eliciting both local and systemic immunity, mucosal vaccination strategies that are non-invasive in nature may increase patient compliance and reduce the need for vaccine application by trained personnel."
6349,A relatively new concept is mucosal immunization using DNA vaccines.
6350,"The advantages of DNA vaccines, such as the opportunity to combine the genetic information of various antigen epitopes and stimulatory cytokines, the enhanced stability and ease of production make this class of vaccines attractive and suitable for mucosal application."
6351,"In contrast to the area of intranasal vaccination, only a few recent studies have focused on pulmonary immunization and the involvement of the pulmonary immune system in eliciting protective immune responses against inhaled pathogens."
6352,This review focuses on DNA vaccine delivery to the lung as a promising approach to prevent pulmonary-associated diseases caused by inhaled pathogens.
6353,"Attractive immunological features of the lung as a site for immunization, the mechanisms of action of DNA vaccines and the pulmonary application of such vaccines using novel delivery systems will be discussed."
6354,We also examine pulmonary diseases prone to prevention or therapeutical intervention by application of DNA vaccines.
6355,: Marburg virus (MARV) causes severe haemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates and has a high mortality rate.
6356,"However, effective drugs or licensed vaccines are not currently available to control the outbreak and spread of this disease."
6357,"METHODS: In this study, we generated MARV virus-like particles (VLPs) by co-expressing the glycoprotein (GP) and matrix protein (VP40) using the baculovirus expression system."
6358,"MARV VLPs and three adjuvants, Poria cocos polysaccharide (PCP-II), poly(I:C) and aluminium hydroxide, were evaluated after intramuscular vaccination in mice."
6359,RESULTS: Murine studies demonstrated that vaccination with the MARV VLPs induce neutralizing antibodies and cellar immune responses.
6360,"MARV VLPs and the PCP-II adjuvant group resulted in high titres of MARV-specific antibodies, activated relatively higher numbers of B cells and T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and induced greater cytokine secretion from splenocytes than the other adjuvants."
6361,CONCLUSION: MARV VLPs with the PCP-II adjuvant may constitute an effective vaccination and PCP-II should be further investigated as a novel adjuvant.
6362,CHAPTER 34 Virology Research
6363,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) encode a mixture of highly conserved and novel genes, as well as genetic elements necessary for infection and pathogenesis, raising the possibility of common targets for attenuation and therapeutic design."
6364,"In this study, we focused on highly conserved nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16), a viral 2′O-methyltransferase (2′O-MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection."
6365,"Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis."
6366,"While the absence of 2′O-MTase activity had only a marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV demonstrated significant attenuation relative to the control both in primary human airway cell cultures and in vivo."
6367,Further examination indicated that dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV had a type I interferon (IFN)-based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of molecules of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats.
6368,"Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted the use of dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from a challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain."
6369,These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2′O-MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting.
6370,"IMPORTANCE Coronavirus (CoV) emergence in both humans and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and swine delta CoV in the 21st century."
6371,These studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2′O-MTase activity of CoVs for attenuation.
6372,"With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT (IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats)-based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live attenuated vaccine platform, as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emergent CoV strains."
6373,"Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-CoV functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad applicability of targeting viral 2′O-MTase function across CoVs."
6374,"Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP), a high fatality condition causing haemorrhages in calves aged less than 4 weeks, was first reported in 2007 in Germany and subsequently observed at low incidence in other European countries and New Zealand."
6375,A multi-country matched case-control study was conducted in 2011 to identify calf-level risk factors for BNP.
6376,"405 BNP cases were recruited from 330 farms in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands by laboratory confirmation of farmer-reported cases."
6377,Up to four calves of similar age from the same farm were selected as controls (1154 calves).
6378,Risk factor data were collected by questionnaire.
6379,"Multivariable modelling using conditional logistic regression indicated that PregSure®BVD (PregSure, Pfizer Animal Health) vaccination of the dam was strongly associated with BNP cases (adjusted matched Odds Ratio - amOR 17.8 first lactation dams; 95% confidence interval – ci 2.4, 134.4; p = 0.005), and second or more lactation PregSure-vaccinated dams were more likely to have a case than first lactation vaccinated dams (amOR 2.2 second lactation; ci 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.024; amOR 5.3 third or more lactation; ci 2.9, 9.8; p = <0.001)."
6380,"Feeding colostrum from other cows was strongly associated with BNP if the dam was not PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 30.5; ci 2.1, 440.5; p = 0.012), but the effect was less if the dam was PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 2.1; ci 1.1, 4.0; p = 0.024)."
6381,"Feeding exclusively dam’s milk was a higher risk than other types of milk (amOR 3.4; ci 1.6, 7.5; p = 0.002)."
6382,"The population attributable fractions were 0.84 (ci 0.68, 0.92) for PregSure vaccination, 0.13 (ci 0.06, 0.19) for feeding other cows’ colostrum, and 0.15 (ci 0.08, 0.22) for feeding dam’s milk."
6383,"No other calf-level factors were identified, suggesting that there are other important factors that are outside the scope of this study, such as genetics, which explain why BNP develops in some PregSure-colostrum-exposed calves but not in others."
6384,: Oral immunization with vaccines may be an effective strategy for prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).
6385,"However, application of previously developed vaccines for preventing CDI has been limited due to various reasons."
6386,"Here, we developed a recombinant Lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a C. difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for CDI prevention."
6387,"METHODS: Recombinant L. lactis vaccine was developed using the pTRKH2 plasmid, a high-copy-number Escherichia coli-L. shuttle vector: 1) L. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the Usp45 signal peptide (SPUsp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC), and 14 of the 38 C-terminal repeats (14CDTA) of nontoxic C. difficile toxin A (TcdA); and 2) L. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying SPUsp45, TETC, 14CDTA, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6 (cwaM6)."
6388,"Then, 32 male Syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gavage of normal saline (blank control) and L. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector, secreted-protein plasmid, and membrane-anchored plasmid, respectively."
6389,"After 1-week gavage of clindamycin, the animals were administered with C. difficile spore suspension."
6390,"General symptoms and intestinal pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy, respectively."
6391,Protein levels of anti-TcdA IgG/IgA antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
6392,A cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by TcdA treatment with or without anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation or treatment.
6393,Apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (FL) assay.
6394,Expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (PCR) assay.
6395,"RESULTS: After the C. difficile challenge, the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4, indicating that the CDI animal model was established in hamster."
6396,"Of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases, and pathological scores, with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group (P < 0.05)."
6397,The tilter of IgG antibody directed against TcdA was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty plasmid group (P < 0.05) while the corresponding titer of IgA antibody directed against TcdA had no substantial differences (P > 0.05).
6398,The anti-TcdA serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml TcdA with the best protective effect achieved by anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation.
6399,The incidences of TcdA-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-TcdA serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group (P < 0.05).
6400,"MCP-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, and Gro-1 mRNA expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups."
6401,"CONCLUSION: Recombinant L. lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing CDI in the hamster model, thus providing an alternative for immunization of C. difficile-associated diseases."
6402,The development of an effective vaccine is critical for prevention of a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pandemic.
6403,Some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of MERS-CoV spike (S) is a good candidate antigen for a MERS-CoV subunit vaccine.
6404,"However, highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic."
6405,We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen.
6406,"Therefore, the immunogenicity of a novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes."
6407,Different vaccination regimens were compared in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly (i.m.)
6408,"with a vaccine containing 10 µg of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD in combination with either aluminium hydroxide (alum) alone, alum and polyriboinosinic acid (poly I:C) or alum and cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN)."
6409,"The immune responses of mice vaccinated with RBD, incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and CpG ODN by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route were also investigated."
6410,We evaluated the induction of RBD-specific humoral immunity (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity (ELISpot assay for IFN-γ spot-forming cells and splenocyte cytokine production).
6411,Our findings indicated that the combination of alum and CpG ODN optimized the development of RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination.
6412,"Interestingly, robust RBD-specific antibody and T-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rRBD protein in combination with IFA and CpG ODN, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited."
6413,Our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes.
6414,The vaccination regimen used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine by eliciting effective humoral and cellular immune responses.
6415," Although the recent SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that appeared in 2002 has now been contained, the possibility of re-emergence of SARS-CoV remains."
6416,"Due to the threat of re-emergence, the overall fatality rate of ∼10%, and the rapid dispersion of the virus via international travel, viable vaccine candidates providing protection from SARS are clearly needed."
6417,We developed an attenuated VSV recombinant (VSV-S) expressing the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein.
6418,"In cells infected with this recombinant, S protein was synthesized, glycosylated at approximately 17 Asn residues, and transported via the Golgi to the cell surface."
6419,Mice vaccinated with VSV-S developed SARS-neutralizing antibody and were able to control a challenge with SARS-CoV performed at 1 month or 4 months after a single vaccination.
6420,"We also demonstrated, by passive antibody transfer, that the antibody response induced by the vaccine was sufficient for controlling SARS-CoV infection."
6421,A VSV-vectored SARS vaccine could have significant advantages over other SARS vaccine candidates described to date.
6422,"The highly infectious porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which belongs to the coronaviruses (CoVs), causes diarrhea and high mortality rates in piglets, resulting in severe economic losses in the pork industry worldwide."
6423,"In this study, we used Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) to anchor the expression of TGEV antigen (S) to dendritic cells (DCs) via dendritic cell-targeting peptides (DCpep)."
6424,The results show that S antigen could be detected on the surface of L. plantarum by different detection methods.
6425,"Furthermore, flow cytometry and ELISA techniques were used to measure the cellular, mucosal, and humoral immune responses of the different orally gavaged mouse groups."
6426,"The obtained results demonstrated the significant effect of the constructed L. plantarum expressing S-DCpep fusion proteins in inducing high expression levels of B7 molecules on DCs, as well as high levels of IgG, secretory IgA, and IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokines compared with the other groups."
6427,"Accordingly, surface expression of DC-targeted antigens successfully induced cellular, mucosal, and humoral immunity in mice and could be used as a vaccine."
6428, Development of effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is still a priority in prevention of re-emergence of SARS.
6429,Our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein elicits highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals.
6430,"But it is unknown whether RBD can also induce protective immunity in an animal model, a key aspect for vaccine development."
6431,"In this study, BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.)"
6432,with 10μg of RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month.
6433,"Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 post-vaccination."
6434,"Mice were challenged with the homologous strain of SARS-CoV 5 days after the last boost, and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge."
6435,"Mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load, virus replication and histopathological effects."
6436,Our results showed that RBD-Fc vaccination induced high titer of S-specific antibodies with long-term and potent SARS-CoV neutralizing activity.
6437,"Four of five vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge because no significant virus replication, and no obvious histopathological changes were found in the lung tissues of the vaccinated mice challenged with SARS-CoV."
6438,Only one vaccinated mouse had mild alveolar damage in the lung tissues.
6439,"In contrast, high copies of SARS-CoV RNA and virus replication were detected, and pathological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice."
6440,"In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBD, which can induce protective antibodies to SARS-CoV, may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine."
6441,Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic re-emerging virus that causes outbreaks in South East Asia.
6442,"Currently, no approved and licensed vaccine or antivirals exist."
6443,"Here, we investigated the efficacy of ChAdOx1 NiV(B), a simian adenovirus-based vaccine encoding NiV glycoprotein (G) Bangladesh, in Syrian hamsters."
6444,"Prime-only as well as prime-boost vaccination resulted in uniform protection against a lethal challenge with NiV Bangladesh: all animals survived challenge and we were unable to find infectious virus either in oral swabs, lung or brain tissue."
6445,"Furthermore, no pathological lung damage was observed."
6446,A single-dose of ChAdOx1 NiV(B) also prevented disease and lethality from heterologous challenge with NiV Malaysia.
6447,"While we were unable to detect infectious virus in swabs or tissue of animals challenged with the heterologous strain, a very limited amount of viral RNA could be found in lung tissue by in situ hybridization."
6448,A single dose of ChAdOx1 NiV(B) also provided partial protection against Hendra virus and passive transfer of antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 NiV(B) vaccination partially protected Syrian hamsters against NiV Bangladesh.
6449,"From these data, we conclude that ChAdOx1 NiV(B) is a suitable candidate for further NiV vaccine pre-clinical development."
6450, A ferret model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of an adenovirus vaccine.
6451,Animals were subjected to heterologous prime-boost using vectors from human serotype 5 and chimpanzee derived adenoviruses (human AdHu5 and chimpanzee AdC7) expressing spike protein followed by intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV.
6452,Vaccination led to a substantial reduction in viral load and prevented the severe pneumonia seen in unvaccinated animals.
6453,The same prime-boost strategy was effective in rhesus macaques in eliciting SARS-CoV specific immune responses.
6454,These data indicate that a heterologous adenovirus-based prime-boost vaccine strategy could safely stimulate strong immunity that may be needed for complete protection against SARS-CoV infection.
6455,: Avian influenza viruses of H9N2 subtype have become highly prevalent in avian species.
6456,"Although these viruses generally cause only mild to moderate disease, they can infect a wide variety of species, including chickens, quail, turkeys, ducks, geese, pheasant, partridge, and pigeon, even transmitted to mammalian species, including humans, accelerating the efforts to devise protective strategies against them."
6457,RESULTS: The results showed that stronger immune responses were induced in a mouse model immunized with BV-Dual-HA than in those vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the same antigen.
6458,"Moreover, complete protection against lethal challenge with H9N2 virus was observed in mice."
6459,CONCLUSION: BV-Dual-HA could be utilized as a vaccine candidate against H9N2 virus infection.
6460,The ability of Dendritic Cells (DC) to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses has been exploited to develop potent anti-cancer immunotherapies.
6461,Recent clinical trials exploring the efficacy of ex vivo modified autologous DC-based vaccines have reported some promising results.
6462,"However, in vitro generation of autologous DC for clinical administration, their loading with tumor associated antigens (TAA) and their activation, is laborious and expensive, and, due to interindividual variability in the personalized vaccines, poorly standardized."
6463,"An attractive alternative approach is to load resident DC in vivo by targeted delivery of TAA , using viral vectors and activating them simultaneously."
6464,To this end we have constructed genetically modified Adenoviral (Ad) vectors and bispecific adaptor molecules to retarget Ad vectors encoding TAA to the CD40 receptor on DC.
6465,"Preclinical human and murine studies conducted so far have clearly demonstrated the suitability of a “two-component”, i.e."
6466,"Ad and adaptor molecule, configuration for targeted modification of DC in vivo for cancer immunotherapy."
6467,This review summarizes recent progress in the development of CD40-targeted Ad-based cancer vaccines and highlights pre-clinical issues in clinical translation of this approach.
6468, We investigated the effect of vaccination of male beef calves (mean age±S.D.
6469,": 158±31days) against bovine herpes virus (BHV-1 or IBR virus), bovine respiratory syncitial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus and para-influenza (PI3) virus on the incidence of respiratory disease during the first forty days after weaning and entering a feed-lot in Portugal."
6470,"In May 2003, Mertolenga, Preta and mixed-breed calves from 10 different beef herds, were systematically assigned (by order of entrance in a chute) to two treatment groups, before moving to a common feed-lot."
6471,One hundred and twenty five male calves were vaccinated with a quadrivalent vaccine (Rispoval 4®) and revaccinated after 21–27 days while 148 herdmates were injected with saline (0.9% NaCl) on the same occasions.
6472,The incidence and severity of clinical cases of “bovine respiratory disease” (BRD) were evaluated every day during the first 40 days after entering the feed-lot.
6473,Morbidity (3% vs. 14%) and mortality (0% vs. 4%) due to BRD were significantly lower in the vaccinated group.
6474,"Ten days after revaccination, the calves were treated with an antimicrobial – ending the study – after an outbreak of BRD caused a high incidence of disease in the non-vaccinated group."
6475,"In conclusion, our results showed that Rispoval 4®, a quadrivalent vaccine against respiratory viruses, under field conditions, reduces morbidity and mortality due to BRD in beef calves after weaning."
6476,Intranasally administered live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines provide significant protection against heterologous influenza A virus (IAV) challenge.
6477,"However, LAIV administration can modify the bacterial microbiota in the upper respiratory tract, including alterations in species that cause pneumonia."
6478,"We sought to evaluate the effect of Bordetella bronchiseptica colonization on LAIV immunogenicity and efficacy in swine, and the impact of LAIV and IAV challenge on B. bronchiseptica colonization and disease."
6479,"LAIV immunogenicity was not significantly impacted by B. bronchiseptica colonization, but protective efficacy against heterologous IAV challenge in the upper respiratory tract was impaired."
6480,"Titers of IAV in the nose and trachea of pigs that received LAIV were significantly reduced when compared to non-vaccinated, challenged controls, regardless of B. bronchiseptica infection."
6481,"Pneumonia scores were higher in pigs colonized with B. bronchiseptica and challenged with IAV, but this was regardless of LAIV vaccination status."
6482,"While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection against heterologous IAV challenge, the protection was not sterilizing and IAV replicated in the respiratory tract of all LAIV vaccinated pig."
6483,"The interaction between IAV, B. bronchiseptica, and host led to development of acute-type B. bronchiseptica lesions in the lung."
6484,"Thus, the data presented do not negate the efficacy of LAIV vaccination, but instead indicate that controlling B. bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between IAV and Bordetella on swine health."
6485, Human adenoviral (HAd) vectors have demonstrated great potential as vaccine vectors.
6486,"Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of vector design, robust antigen expression and protective immunity using this system."
6487,"However, clinical use of adenoviral vectors for vaccine purposes is anticipated to be limited by vector immunity that is either preexisting or develops rapidly following the first inoculation with adenoviral vectors."
6488,"Vector immunity inactivates the vector particles and rapidly removes the transduced cells, thereby limiting the duration of transgene expression."
6489,"Due to strong vector immunity, subsequent use of the same vector is usually less efficient."
6490,"In order to circumvent this limitation, nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been proposed as alternative vectors."
6491,"In addition to eluding HAd immunity, these vectors possess most of the attractive features of HAd vectors."
6492,Several replication-competent or replication-defective nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been developed and investigated for their potential as vaccine-delivery vectors.
6493,"Here, we review recent advances in the design and characterization of various nonhuman adenoviral vectors, and discuss their potential applications for human and animal vaccination."
6494,"Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) usually co-infect pigs in modern large-scale piggery, which both can cause severe diarrhea in newborn piglets and lead to significant economic losses to the pig industry."
6495,"The VP7 protein is the main coat protein of PoRV, and the S protein is the main structural protein of PEDV, which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo."
6496,"In this study, a DNA vaccine pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S co-expressing VP7 protein of PoRV and S protein of PEDV was constructed."
6497,Six 8-week-old mice were immunized with the recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S.
6498,"The high humoral immune responses (virus specific antibody) and cellular immune responses (IFN-γ, IL-4, and spleen lymphocyte proliferation) were evaluated."
6499,The immune effect through intramuscular injection increased with plasmid dose when compared with subcutaneous injection.
6500,The immune-enhancing effect of IFN-α adjuvant was excellent compared with pig spleen transfer factor and IL-12 adjuvant.
6501,"These results demonstrated that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S possess the immunological functions of the VP7 proteins of PoRV and S proteins of PEDV, indicating that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S is a candidate vaccine for porcine rotaviral infection (PoR) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED)."
6502,The outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the immunological response to the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine are highly variable in humans.
6503,"Deciphering the relative importance of host genetics, environment, and vaccine preparation for the efficacy of BCG has proven difficult in natural populations."
6504,"We developed a model system that captures the breadth of immunological responses observed in outbred individual mice, which can be used to understand the contribution of host genetics to vaccine efficacy."
6505,"This system employs a panel of highly diverse inbred mouse strains, consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the “Collaborative Cross” project."
6506,"Unlike natural populations, the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically identical individuals and the quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination."
6507,"When analyzed in the aggregate, our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects: the animals displayed a broad range of susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, differed in their immunological responses to infection, and were not durably protected by BCG vaccination."
6508,"However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable."
6509,"M. tuberculosis susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive M. tuberculosis clearance."
6510,"Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination."
6511,"The efficacy of BCG was genetically separable from susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection."
6512,These observations support an important role for host genetic diversity in determining BCG efficacy and provide a new resource to rationally develop more broadly efficacious vaccines.
6513,"In veterinary animal species, vaccines are the primary tool for disease prevention, a key tool for treatment of infection, and essential for helping maintain animal welfare and productivity."
6514,Traditional vaccine development by trial-and-error has achieved many successes.
6515,"However, effective vaccines that provide solid cross-protective immunity with excellent safety are still needed for many diseases."
6516,The path to development of vaccines against difficult pathogens requires recognition of uniquely evolved immunological interactions of individual animal hosts and their specific pathogens.
6517,"Here, general principles that currently guide veterinary immunology and vaccinology research are reviewed, with an emphasis on examples from swine."
6518,Advances in genomics and proteomics now provide the community with powerful tools for elucidation of regulatory and effector mechanisms of protective immunity that provide new opportunities for successful translation of immunological discoveries into safe and effective vaccines.
6519,Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world.
6520,"Since the effectiveness of the only available tuberculosis vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is suboptimal, there is a strong demand to develop new tuberculosis vaccines."
6521,"As tuberculosis is an airborne disease, the intranasal route of vaccination might be preferable."
6522,"Live influenza virus vaccines might be considered as potential vectors for mucosal immunization against various viral or bacterial pathogens, including M. tuberculosis."
6523,We generated several subtypes of attenuated recombinant influenza A viruses expressing the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target protein (ESAT-6) of M. tuberculosis from the NS1 reading frame.
6524,We were able to demonstrate the potency of influenza virus NS vectors to induce an M. tuberculosis-specific Th1 immune response in mice.
6525,"Moreover, intranasal immunization of mice and guinea pigs with such vectors induced protection against mycobacterial challenge, similar to that induced by BCG vaccination."
6526, Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated and replication-deficient virus serving as vaccine against infectious diseases.
6527,"Here, we assessed the in vivo distribution of a recombinant MVA candidate vaccine against the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MVA-MERS-S) in mice."
6528,"Intramuscularly inoculated mice were necropsied at different time points and examined by histology, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR."
6529,We detected inflammation and myonecrosis at the parenteral site and hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes.
6530,MVA-MERS-S did not result in detectable lesions in tissues peripheral to the parenteral site and draining lymph nodes.
6531,"Real-time PCR analysis of >240 tissue samples detected MVA-DNA predominantly at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes, and suggested continuous clearance of the candidate vaccine during the observation period."
6532,Levels of parenteral site inflammation and hyperplasia of draining lymph nodes were considered in line with immunological responses to vaccine inoculation.
6533, The persistent public health threat of infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the need for an effective MERS-CoV vaccine.
6534,Previous studies have focused mainly on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein of MERS-CoV.
6535,"Herein, we investigated the immunogenicity and protective potential of the recombinant N-terminal domain (rNTD) of spike proteins as a vaccine candidate."
6536,BALB/c mice vaccinated with 5 or 10μg of rNTD protein demonstrated a significant humoral immune response (serum IgG and neutralizing activity).
6537,"Additionally, according to the enzyme-linked immunospot, intracellular cytokine staining, and cytometric bead array assays, significant and functional T-cell immunity was induced by 10μg of the rNTD vaccination with aluminum and CpG adjuvant."
6538,"Furthermore, rNTD-immunized mice showed reduced lung abnormalities in a MERS-CoV-challenge mouse model transfected with an adenoviral vector expressing human DPP4, showing protection consistent with that found with rRBD vaccination."
6539,"These data show that rNTD induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and that it demonstrated protective capacity against a viral challenge, indicating that rNTD is a vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection."
6540,Recombinant vaccine strain-derived measles virus (MV) is clinically tested both as vaccine platform to protect against other pathogens and as oncolytic virus for tumor treatment.
6541,"To investigate the potential synergism in anti-tumoral efficacy of oncolytic and vaccine properties, we chose Ovalbumin and an ideal tumor antigen, claudin-6, for pre-clinical proof of concept."
6542,"To enhance immunogenicity, both antigens were presented by retroviral virus-like particle produced in situ during MV-infection."
6543,"All recombinant MV revealed normal growths, genetic stability, and proper expression and presentation of both antigens."
6544,Potent antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity were found in immunized MV-susceptible IFNAR(−/−)-CD46Ge mice.
6545,These immune responses significantly inhibited metastasis formation or increased therapeutic efficacy compared to control MV in respective novel in vivo tumor models using syngeneic B16-hCD46/mCLDN6 murine melanoma cells.
6546,These data indicate the potential of MV to trigger selected tumor antigen-specific immune responses on top of direct tumor lysis for enhanced efficacy.
6547,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects ∼2% of the world's population.
6548,"It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 new infections annually in Egypt, the country with the highest HCV prevalence."
6549,An effective vaccine would help control this expanding global health burden.
6550,"HCV is highly variable, and an effective vaccine should target conserved T- and B-cell epitopes of the virus."
6551,Conserved B-cell epitopes overlapping the CD81 receptor-binding site (CD81bs) on the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein have been reported previously and provide promising vaccine targets.
6552,"In this study, we isolated 73 human mAbs recognizing five distinct antigenic regions on the virus envelope glycoprotein complex E1E2 from an HCV-immune phage-display antibody library by using an exhaustive-panning strategy."
6553,Many of these mAbs were broadly neutralizing.
6554,"In particular, the mAb AR4A, recognizing a discontinuous epitope outside the CD81bs on the E1E2 complex, has an exceptionally broad neutralizing activity toward diverse HCV genotypes and protects against heterologous HCV challenge in a small animal model."
6555,The mAb panel will be useful for the design and development of vaccine candidates to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to HCV.
6556, Over 12 years have elapsed since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) triggered the first global alert for coronavirus infections.
6557,Virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since.
6558,"However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans."
6559,"The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
6560,It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection.
6561,"Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus infections."
6562,Use of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Gain-Of-Function Studies for Molecular-Based Surveillance and Pandemic Preparedness
6563,"The 20th International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Pacific Rim to3ok place in Shenzhen, China on January 8–9, 2018 followed by meetings of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)/immunology, acute respiratory infections, cancer, hepatitis, and viral diseases panels on January 10–11."
6564,The conference was organized as part of the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Sciences Program (USJCMSP) by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was locally hosted by the Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute of Microbiology.
6565,The conference provides the basis for networking and fostering of collaboration opportunities between researchers in Southeast Asia and the United States based on the scientific and interactive platform of the USJCMSP and takes place in the region on an annual basis.
6566,This report summarizes the discussions and conclusions from the conference.
6567,"Previously, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) pseudotypes expressing Ebolavirus glycoproteins (GPs) in place of the VSV G protein demonstrated protection of nonhuman primates from lethal homologous Ebolavirus challenge."
6568,Those pseudotype vectors contained no additional attenuating mutations in the rVSV genome.
6569,Here we describe rVSV vectors containing a full complement of VSV genes and expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP from an additional transcription unit.
6570,These rVSV vectors contain the same combination of attenuating mutations used previously in the clinical development pathway of an rVSV/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine.
6571,"One of these rVSV vectors (N4CT1-EBOVGP1), which expresses membrane-anchored EBOV GP from the first position in the genome (GP1), elicited a balanced cellular and humoral GP-specific immune response in mice."
6572,"Guinea pigs immunized with a single dose of this vector were protected from any signs of disease following lethal EBOV challenge, while control animals died in 7–9 days."
6573,"Subsequently, N4CT1-EBOVGP1 demonstrated complete, single-dose protection of 2 macaques following lethal EBOV challenge."
6574,A single sham-vaccinated macaque died from disease due to EBOV infection.
6575,These results demonstrate that highly attenuated rVSV vectors expressing EBOV GP may provide safer alternatives to current EBOV vaccines.
6576," The recombinant nucleocapsid (rN) protein of the coronavirus (CoV) responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, extracted from cell lysates containing 6M urea, then purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography."
6577,"In animal immunogenicity studies, we found that most anti-rN protein antibodies were IgG2a in BALB/c mice vaccinated with rN emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 containing the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG."
6578,"In contrast, anti-rN protein antibodies of mice immunized with rN protein in PBS were found to mainly be IgG1."
6579,These results indicated that ISA-51/CpG-formulated rN protein was dramatically biased toward a Th1 immune response.
6580,"To identify the B-cell immunodominant epitopes of the rN protein in the mouse and monkey, the reactivities of antisera raised against purified rN proteins formulated in ISA-51/CpG were tested with a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire N protein sequence."
6581,"Three immunodominant linear B-cell epitope regions were mapped to residues 166–180, 356–375, and 396–410 of the rN protein."
6582,"When the reactivities of these peptides were screened with human sera from five SARS patients, peptides corresponding to residues 156–175 reacted strongly with sera from two of the SARS patients."
6583,"These results indicated that the region around residues 156–175 of the N protein is immunogenic in the mouse, monkey, and human."
6584,"We found that peptides corresponding to residues 1–30, 86–100, 306–320, and 351–365 contained murine immunodominant T-cell epitopes."
6585,"To identify functional CTL epitopes of the N protein, BALB/c mice were immunized with peptides containing the H-2Kd CTL motif emulsified in adjuvant ISA-51/CpG."
6586,"Using an IFN-γ secretion cell assay and analysis by flow cytometry, peptides containing residues 81–95 were found to be capable of stimulating both CD4+ and CD8+ cell proliferation in vitro."
6587,We also only observed that peptides corresponding to residues 336–350 were capable of stimulating IFN-γ production in T-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of macaques immunized with the rN protein emulsified in ISA/CpG adjuvant.
6588,"Our current results together with those of others suggest that some immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epitopes are conserved in the mouse, monkey, and human."
6589,This information is very important for the development SARS diagnostic kits and a vaccine.
6590," Anthrax Euronet, a Coordination Action of the EU 6th Framework Programme, was designed to strengthen networking activities between anthrax research groups in Europe and to harmonise protocols for testing anthrax vaccines and therapeutics."
6591,"Inevitably, the project also addressed aspects of the current political issues of biosecurity and dual-use research, i.e."
6592,"research into agents of important diseases of man, livestock or agriculture that could be used as agents of bioterrorism."
6593,"This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biology of Bacillus anthracis, of the pathogenesis, epidemiology and diagnosis of anthrax, as well as vaccine and therapeutic intervention strategies."
6594,The proposed requirement for a code of conduct for working with dual-use agents such as the anthrax bacillus is also discussed.
6595,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) became a global human health threat since its first documentation in humans in 2012.
6596,"An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved."
6597,"In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736–761 of MERS-CoV spike protein."
6598,"Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3)."
6599,"The chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1."
6600,"Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 + 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert."
6601,"In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09."
6602,This novel approach succeeded in developing a recombinant influenza virus with potential use as a bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV.
6603,This approach provides a basis for the future development of chimeric influenza-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and other viruses.
6604, DNA vaccination has tremendous potential for treating or preventing numerous diseases for which traditional vaccines are ineffective but the technique can be limited by low immunogenicity.
6605,"Current synthetic DNA delivery systems are versatile and safe, but substantially less efficient than viruses."
6606,"Here, a novel multicomponent supramolecular system involving the preparation of mannose-bearing chitosan oligomers microspheres with entrapping complexes of DNA vaccine and polyethylenimine was developed to mimic many of the beneficial properties of the viruses."
6607,"After delivery by intramuscular immunization in BALB/c mice, the microspheres induced an enhanced serum antibody responses two orders of magnitude greater than naked DNA vaccine."
6608,"Additionally, in contrast to naked DNA, the microspheres induced potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses at a low dose."
6609,"Consequently, formulation of DNA vaccines into multicomponent vectors is a powerful means of increasing vaccine potency."
6610,Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is an important human pathogen which may cause severe neurological complications and death in children.
6611,The virus caused several outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region during the past two decades and has been considered a significant public health problem in the post-poliovirus eradication era.
6612,"Unlike poliovirus, there is no effective vaccine or approved antivirals against EV71."
6613,To explore anti-EV71 agents therefore is of vital importance.
6614,Several strategies have been employed to develop antivirals based on the molecular characteristics of the virus.
6615,"Among these, some small molecules that were developed against human rhinoviruses and poliovirus are under evaluation."
6616,"In this review, we discuss the recent development of such small molecules against EV71, known drug resistance and possible solutions to it, and animal models for evaluating the efficacy of these antivirals."
6617,"Although further investigation is required for clinical applications of the existing candidates, the molecular mechanisms revealed for the inhibition of EV71 replication can be used for designing new molecules against this virus in the future."
6618,"For developing efficient vaccines, it is essential to identify which amino acid changes are most important to the survival of the virus."
6619,We investigate the amino acid substitution features in the Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (AIBV) antigenic domain of a vaccine serotype (DE072) and a virulent viral strain (GA98) to better understand adaptive evolution of AIBV.
6620,"In addition, the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was also analyzed in the same way."
6621,It is interesting to find that extreme comparability exists between AIBV and SARS in amino acid substitution pattern.
6622,It suggests that amino acid changes that result in overall shift of residue charge and polarity should be paid special attention to during the development of vaccines.
6623,"Studies of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as delivery vehicles have focused mainly on the development of mucosal vaccines, with much effort being devoted to the generation of genetic tools for antigen expression in different bacterial locations."
6624,"Subsequently, interleukins have been co-expressed with antigens in LAB to enhance the immune response that is raised against the antigen."
6625,"LAB have also been used as a delivery system for a range of molecules that have different applications, including anti-infectives, therapies for allergic diseases and therapies for gastrointestinal diseases."
6626,"Now that the first human trial with a Lactococcus strain that expresses recombinant interleukin-10 has been completed, we discuss what we have learnt, what we do not yet understand and what the future holds for therapy and prophylaxis with LAB."
6627,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel infectious agent causing severe respiratory disease and death in humans, was first described in 2012."
6628,Antibodies directed against the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling MERS-CoV infection and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity.
6629,"In contrast, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS-CoV that are recognized by CD8+ T cells."
6630,"In this study, the highly conserved MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein served as a target immunogen to elicit MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses."
6631,"Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for generating MVA-MERS-N expressing recombinant N protein."
6632,Overlapping peptides spanning the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in BALB/c mice immunized with MVA-MERS-N. We have identified a H2-d restricted decamer peptide epitope in the MERS-N protein with CD8+ T cell antigenicity.
6633,"The identification of this epitope, and the availability of the MVA-MERS-N candidate vaccine, will help to evaluate MERS-N-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of MERS-CoV infection."
6634,The design of optimized nanoparticles offers a promising strategy to enable DNA vaccines to cross various physiological barriers for eliciting a specific and protective mucosal immunity via intranasal administration.
6635,"Here, we reported a new designed nanoparticle system through incorporating anionic liposomes (AL) into chitosan/DNA (CS/DNA) complexes."
6636,"With enhanced cellular uptake, the constructed AL/CS/DNA nanoparticles can deliver the anti-caries DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX into nasal mucosa."
6637,TEM results showed the AL/CS/DNA had a spherical structure.
6638,High DNA loading ability and effective DNA protection against nuclease were proved by gel electrophoresis.
6639,"The surface charge of the AL/CS/DNA depended strongly on pH environment, enabling the intracellular release of loaded DNA via a pH-mediated manner."
6640,"In comparison to the traditional CS/DNA system, our new design rendered a higher transfection efficiency and longer residence time of the AL/CS/DNA at nasal mucosal surface."
6641,"These outstanding features enable the AL/CS/DNA to induce a significantly (p<0.01) higher level of secretory IgA (SIgA) than the CS/DNA in animal study, and a longer-term mucosal immunity."
6642,"On the other hand, the AL/CS/DNA exhibited minimal cytotoxicity."
6643,These results suggest that the developed nanoparticles offer a potential platform for DNA vaccine packaging and delivery for more efficient elicitation of mucosal immunity.
6644,"To control the latent social risk of disease, the government usually spreads accurate information and attempts to improve the public’s attitude toward adopting prevention."
6645,"However, these methods with the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model do not always work."
6646,"Therefore, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand dog owners’ behavior and distinguished the knowledge effect as objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK)."
6647,A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model.
6648,We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results.
6649,"First, our model was fit, and each path was significant."
6650,"People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention."
6651,"Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model."
6652,"Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge."
6653,We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations.
6654,"To reduce the latent social risk of disease, the government should not only address dog owners’ attitudes, but also their subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control."
6655,"Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model."
6656,It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners is the most important factor in such a behavior.
6657,"Therefore, the government should focus on enhancing dog owners’ self-efficacy first while devoted to prevention activities."
6658,"By their very nature, great advances in immunology are usually underpinned by experiments carried out in animal models and inbred lines of mice."
6659,"Also, their corresponding knock-out or knock-in derivatives have been the most commonly used animal systems in immunological studies."
6660,"With much credit to their usefulness, laboratory mice will never provide all the answers to fully understand immunological processes."
6661,Large animal models offer unique biological and experimental advantages that have been and continue to be of great value to the understanding of biological and immunological processes.
6662,"From the identification of B cells to the realization that γδ T cells can function as professional antigen presenting cells, farm animals have contributed significantly to a better understanding of immunity."
6663,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), two members of the Pneumoviridae family, account for the majority of severe lower respiratory tract infections worldwide in very young children."
6664,They are also a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunocompromised adults.
6665,"High levels of neutralizing antibodies, mostly directed against the viral fusion (F) glycoprotein, correlate with protection against either hRSV or hMPV."
6666,"However, no cross‐neutralization is observed in polyclonal antibody responses raised after virus infection or immunization with purified F proteins."
6667,"Based on crystal structures of hRSV F and hMPV F, we designed chimeric F proteins in which certain residues of well‐characterized antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens."
6668,The antigenic changes were monitored by ELISA with virus‐specific monoclonal antibodies.
6669,"Inoculation of mice with these chimeras induced polyclonal cross‐neutralizing antibody responses, and mice were protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site."
6670,These results provide a proof of principle for chimeric fusion proteins as single immunogens that can induce cross‐neutralizing antibody and protective responses against more than one human pneumovirus.
6671," The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002–2003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak."
6672,"Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion."
6673,"Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown."
6674,"Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models."
6675,"In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS."
6676,"Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur."
6677,Lassa virus infection elicits distinctive changes in host gene expression and metabolism.
6678,We focus on changes in host gene expression that may be biomarkers that discriminate individual pathogens or may help to provide a prognosis for disease.
6679,"In addition to assessing mRNA changes, functional studies are also needed to discriminate causes of disease from mechanisms of host resistance."
6680,Host responses that drive pathogenesis are likely to be targets for prevention or therapy.
6681,"Host responses to Lassa or its related arenaviruses have been monitored in cell culture, in animal models of hemorrhagic fever, in Lassa-infected nonhuman primates and, to a limited extent, in infected human beings."
6682,"Here, we describe results from those studies and discuss potential targets for reducing virus replication and mitigating disease."
6683, Murine antisera with neutralising activity for the coronavirus causative of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were induced by immunisation of Balb/c mice with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein.
6684,The murine antisera induced were fully-neutralising in vitro for two separate clinical strains of the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
6685,"To test the neutralising capacity of these antisera in vivo, susceptibility to MERS-CoV was induced in naive recipient Balb/c mice by the administration of an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor (Ad5-hDPP4) for MERS-CoV, prior to the passive transfer of the RBD-specific murine antisera to the transduced mice."
6686,"Subsequent challenge of the recipient transduced mice by the intra-nasal route with a clinical isolate of the MERS-CoV resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs, compared with transduced mice receiving a negative control antibody."
6687,"The murine antisera used were derived from mice which had been primed sub-cutaneously with a recombinant fusion of RBD with a human IgG Fc tag (RBD-Fc), adsorbed to calcium phosphate microcrystals and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse micelles."
6688,"The data gained indicate that this dual-route vaccination with novel formulations of the RBD-Fc, induced systemic and mucosal anti-viral immunity with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo neutralisation capacity for clinical strains of MERS-CoV."
6689, Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) have significant impact on beef and dairy production worldwide.
6690,"The infections are widespread in the cattle populations, and in many production systems, vaccinations are utilized."
6691,"BVDV strains have the hallmark of adversely affecting the immune system's many components, both the innate and acquired systems."
6692,"While BVDV do cause primary infections and disease, their role in the pathogenesis of other agents underscores the complexity of viral–bacterial synergy."
6693,A greater understanding of the role of the persistently infected (PI) animal resulting from susceptible females infected at a critical stage of pregnancy has permitted acknowledgment of a major source of infection to susceptible animals.
6694,"Not only do we understand the role of the PI in transmitting infections and complicating other infections, but we now focus attempts to better diagnose and remove the PI animal."
6695,"Vaccinations now address the need to have an immune population, especially the breeding females in the herd."
6696,"Biosecurity, detection and removal of the PI, and effective vaccinations are tools for potential successful BVDV control."
6697, Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection causes respiratory tract disease similar to that observed during human respiratory syncytial virus infection (hRSV).
6698,hMPV infections have been reported across the entire age spectrum although the most severe disease occurs in young children.
6699,"No vaccines, chemotherapeutics or antibodies are presently available for preventing or treating hMPV infections."
6700,"In this study, a bovine/human chimeric parainfluenza virus type 3 (b/h PIV3) expressing the human parainfluenza type 3 (hPIV3) fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins was engineered to express hMPV fusion (F) protein from the second genome position (b/h PIV3/hMPV F2) with the goal of generating a novel hMPV vaccine."
6701,"b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 was previously shown to protect hamsters from challenge with wt hMPV (Tang RS, Schickli JH, Macphail M, Fernandes F, Bicha L, Spaete J, et al."
6702,Effects of human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus antigen insertion in two 3’ proximal genome positions of bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 on virus replication and immunogenicity.
6703,J Virol 2003;77:10819–28) and is here further evaluated for efficacy and immunogenicity in African green monkeys (AGMs).
6704,AGMs immunized intranasally and intratracheally with b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 generated hMPV- and hPIV3-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and were protected from wt hMPV infection.
6705,"In a separate study, the host-range restriction of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 replication relative to wt hPIV3 was performed in rhesus monkeys to demonstrate attenuation."
6706,"These studies showed that b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 was immunogenic, protective and attenuated in non-human primates and warrants further evaluation in humans as a vaccine candidate for prevention of hMPV-associated respiratory tract diseases."
6707, We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a chimeric alphavirus vaccine candidate in mice with selective immunodeficiencies.
6708,"This vaccine candidate was highly attenuated in mice with deficiencies in the B and T cell compartments, as well as in mice with deficient gamma-interferon responsiveness."
6709,"However, the level of protection varied among the strains tested."
6710,Wild type mice were protected against lethal VEEV challenge.
6711,"In contrast, alpha/beta (αβ) TCR-deficient mice developed lethal encephalitis following VEEV challenge, while mice deficient in gamma/delta (γδ) T cells were protected."
6712,"Surprisingly, the vaccine potency was diminished by 50% in animals lacking interferon-gamma receptor alpha chain (R1)-chain and a minority of vaccinated immunoglobulin heavy chain-deficient (μMT) mice survived challenge, which suggests that neutralizing antibody may not be absolutely required for protection."
6713,Prolonged replication of encephalitic VEEV in the brain of pre-immunized mice is not lethal and adoptive transfer experiments indicate that CD3+ T cells are required for protection.
6714,The recently identified Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe and fatal acute respiratory illness in humans.
6715,"However, no approved prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are currently available."
6716,"The MERS-CoV envelope spike protein serves as a crucial target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development, as it plays a critical role in mediating viral entry through interactions with the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)."
6717,"Here, we constructed a recombinant rare serotype of the chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68) that expresses full-length MERS-CoV S protein (AdC68-S)."
6718,Single intranasal immunization with AdC68-S induced robust and sustained neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice.
6719,"In a human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mouse model, it completely protected against lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA)."
6720,Passive transfer of immune sera to naïve hDPP4-KI mice also provided survival advantages from lethal MERS-CoV-MA challenge.
6721,Analysis of sera absorption and isolated monoclonal antibodies from immunized mice demonstrated that the potent and broad neutralizing activity was largely attributed to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein.
6722,These results show that AdC68-S can induce protective immune responses in mice and represent a promising candidate for further development against MERS-CoV infection in both dromedaries and humans.
6723," Vaccine-induced antibodies can prevent or, in the case of feline infectious peritonitis virus, aggravate infections by coronaviruses."
6724,We investigated whether a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was able to elicit a neutralizing and protective immune response in animals and analyzed the capacity of anti-S antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus entry in vitro and enhancement of replication in vivo.
6725,SARS-CoV-specific serum and mucosal immunoglobulins were readily detected in immunized animals.
6726,Serum IgG blocked binding of the S-protein to the ACE2 receptor and neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro.
6727,Entry into human B cell lines occurred in a FcγRII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion indicating that ADE of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV.
6728,Vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis and viral load was undetectable or greatly reduced in lungs following challenge with SARS-CoV.
6729,Altogether our results indicate that a recombinant trimeric S protein was able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response in vivo and warrant concern in the safety evaluation of a human vaccine against SARS-CoV.
6730,MERS-CoV is present in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa.
6731,Dromedary camels are the primary zoonotic reservoir for human infections.
6732,"Interruption of the zoonotic transmission chain from camels to humans, therefore, may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak."
6733,Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels.
6734,Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers.
6735,Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels.
6736,"Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of naïve animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission."
6737,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to subclinical, acute or chronic hepatitis."
6738,"In the prevaccination era, HBV infections were endemic due to frequent mother to child transmission in large regions of the world."
6739,"However, there are still estimated 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca."
6740,"620,000 patients die per year due to HBV-related liver diseases."
6741,Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to satisfactory results.
6742,Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunomodulation may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence.
6743,"Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients with or without therapeutic reduction of viral load did not result in effective immune control of HBV infection, suggesting that combination of antiviral treatment with new formulations of therapeutic vaccines is needed."
6744,The woodchuck (Marmota monax) and its HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus are a useful preclinical animal model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections.
6745,"Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments using nucleos(t)ide analogues, with prime-boost vaccination using DNA vaccines, new hepadnaviral antigens or recombinant adenoviral vectors were tested in the woodchuck model."
6746,"In this review, we summarize these encouraging results obtained with these therapeutic vaccines."
6747,"In addition, we present potential innovations in immunostimulatory strategies by blocking the interaction of the inhibitory programmed death receptor 1 with its ligand in this animal model."
6748, A synthetic gene coding for the surface glycoprotein (G protein) of rabies virus was strategically designed to achieve high-level expression in transgenic plants.
6749,"The native signal peptide was replaced by that of the pathogenesis related protein, PR-S of Nicotiana tabacum."
6750,An endoplasmic reticulum retention signal was included at C-terminus of the G protein.
6751,Tobacco plants were genetically engineered by nuclear transformation.
6752,Selected transgenic lines expressed the chimeric G protein at 0.38% of the total soluble leaf protein.
6753,Mice immunized intraperitoneally with the G protein purified from tobacco leaf microsomal fraction elicited high level of immune response as compared to the inactivated commercial viral vaccine.
6754,The plant-derived G protein induced complete protective immunity in mice against intracerebral lethal challenge with live rabies virus.
6755,The results establish that plants can provide a safe and effective production system for the expression of immunoprotective rabies virus surface protein.
6756,"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV."
6757,It spread rapidly to many countries and developing a SARS vaccine is now urgently required.
6758,"In order to study the immunogenicity of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion as a vaccine candidate, we subcutaneously immunized mice with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV with or without an adjuvant."
6759,"We chose aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) as an adjuvant, because of its long safety history for human use."
6760,"We observed that the UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory B cells."
6761,"With the addition of alum to the vaccine formula, serum IgG production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, though it was still insufficient to elicit serum IgA antibodies."
6762,"Notably, the SARS-CoV virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant."
6763,Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus.
6764,"Furthermore, the UV-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon restimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV virion in vitro."
6765,"Thus, a whole killed virion could serve as a candidate antigen for a SARS vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity."
6766, Emerging and well-known viral diseases remain one the most important global public health threats.
6767,A better understanding of their pathogenesis and mechanisms of transmission requires animal models that accurately reproduce these aspects of the disease.
6768,Here we review the role of ferrets as an animal model for the pathogenesis of different respiratory viruses with an emphasis on influenza and paramyxoviruses.
6769,"We will describe the anatomic and physiologic characteristics that contribute to the natural susceptibility of ferrets to these viruses, and provide an overview of the approaches available to analyze their immune responses."
6770,"Recent insights gained using this model will be highlighted, including the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches."
6771,"To provide decision criteria for the use of this animal model, its strengths and limitations will be discussed."
6772,A novel coronavirus has been recently identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that has accounted for more than 8000 infected people worldwide.
6773,"This review will discuss current knowledge on coronavirus replication, pathogenesis, evolution, and vaccine strategies, as well as the most recent findings on SARS coronavirus."
6774, The Global Virus Network (GVN) was established in 2011 in order to strengthen research and responses to current viral causes of human disease and to prepare against new viral pandemic threats.
6775,There are now 38 GVN Centers of Excellence and 6 Affiliate laboratories in 24 countries.
6776,"GVN scientists meet annually to learn about each other's current research, address collaborative priorities and plan future programs."
6777,"The 2016 meeting was held from October 23–25 in Hokkaido, Japan, in partnership with the Japanese Society for Virology, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan and the Research Center for Zoonosis Control of Hokkaido University."
6778,"This report highlights the accomplishments of GVN researchers in many priority areas of medical virology, including the current Zika epidemic, infections by human papillomavirus, influenza, Ebola, Lassa, dengue, HIV, hepatitis C, and chikungunya viruses, and the development of improved diagnostics and new vaccines."
6779, Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in cattle and causes yearly outbreaks with high morbidity in Europe.
6780,"Commercial vaccines against this virus needs improvement of efficacy, especially in calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies (MDA)."
6781,"We previously reported that an experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, but not a commercial vaccine, induced strong clinical and virological protection in calves with MDA, immunized at 7–15 weeks of age."
6782,"The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune responses, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in younger animals, representing the target population for vaccination."
6783,"Four groups of five 3–8 week old calves with variable levels of BRSV-specific MDA were immunized s.c. twice at a 3 weeks interval with (i) BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), (ii) BRSV-protein, (iii) adjuvant, or (iv) PBS."
6784,All calves were challenged with virulent BRSV by aerosol 2 weeks later and euthanized on day 6 after infection.
6785,"The cellular and humoral responses were monitored as well as the clinical signs, the viral excretion and the pathology following challenge."
6786,"Despite presence of MDA at the time of the immunization, only a minimum of clinical signs were observed in the BRSV-ISCOM group after challenge."
6787,"In contrast, in all control groups, clinical signs of disease were observed in most of the animals (respiratory rates up to 76min−1 and rectal temperatures up to 41°C)."
6788,"The clinical protection was associated to a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of calves, rapid systemic and local antibody responses and T helper cell responses dominated by IFNγ production."
6789,Animals that did not shed virus detectable by PCR or cell culture following challenge possessed particularly high levels of pulmonary IgA.
6790,The protective immunological responses to BRSV proteins and the ability to overcome the inhibiting effect of MDA were dependent on ISCOM borne antigen presentation.
6791, The disease outbreak caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is still ongoing in the Middle East.
6792,Over 1700 people have been infected since it was first reported in September 2012.
6793,"Despite great efforts, licensed vaccines or therapeutics against MERS-CoV remain unavailable."
6794,"The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is an important viral antigen known to mediate host-receptor binding and virus entry, as well as induce robust humoral and cell-mediated responses in humans during infection."
6795,"In this review, we highlight the importance of the S protein in the MERS-CoV life cycle, summarize recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on the S protein, and discuss strategies that can be explored to develop new medical countermeasures against MERS-CoV."
6796,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly identified infectious disease caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with unknown animal reservoirs.
6797,The risk of SARS reemergence in humans remains high due to the large animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-like coronavirus and the genome instability of RNA coronaviruses.
6798,"An epidemic in 2003 affected more than 8,000 patients in 29 countries, with 10% mortality."
6799,SARS infection is transmitted by air droplets.
6800,"Clinical and laboratory manifestations include fever, chills, rigor, myalgia, malaise, diarrhea, cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase activities."
6801,"Health care workers are a high-risk group, and advanced age is strongly associated with disease severity."
6802,"Treatment has been empirical, and there is no licensed SARS vaccine for humans so far."
6803,"However, presence of long-lived neutralizing antibodies and memory T- and B-lymphocytes in convalescent SARS patients raises hope for active immunization."
6804,"Furthermore, results from preclinical SARS vaccines expressing spike protein to elicit neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses that are protective in mouse and nonhuman primate models are encouraging."
6805,Very little is known of the early events in viral clearance and the onset of innate and inflammatory responses during the SARS infection.
6806,Regulation of the innate immune response is associated with the development of adaptive immunity and disease severity in SARS infection.
6807,"Notably, SARS-CoV has evolved evasive strategies to suppress antiviral type I interferon responses in infected cells."
6808,"In addition, inflammatory responses are characterized by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1 in tissues and serum, and massive infiltrations of inflammatory cells such as macrophages in infected tissues."
6809,"Due to the lack of animal models that mimic the clinical manifestations of human SARS infection for mechanistic study and vaccine evaluation, development of a safe prophylactic SARS vaccine for human use remains a huge challenge."
6810,"This chapter is written to summarize and highlight the latest clinical, serological, and immunological parameters relevant to the pathogenesis and protective immunity of SARS infection in humans."
6811,The influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) is an attractive target for avian flu vaccine development because of its high conversancy in the evolutionary chain of the virus.
6812,"Here we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 restricted NP epitopes, named H5N1 NP373-381 AMDSNTLEL (NP373) and NP458-466 FQGRGVFEL (NP458), using computational bioinformatic analysis."
6813,"The NP peptides showed a high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells, and were able to induce the activation of the cytotoxic T cells in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells."
6814,We examined the potential of using NP373 and NP458 peptide sequences supplemented with a single-chain trimer as potential DNA vaccine candidates in an HHD transgenic mouse model.
6815,A gene gun delivery system was used for administrating the vaccine candidates into the animals.
6816,"The results from cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays indicated that a significant amount of IFN-γ was secreted by the T cells of the vaccinated mice, and the T cells were able to eliminate the corresponding peptide-loaded T2 cells."
6817,The discovery of these novel immunogenic NP peptides provides valuable information for avian flu vaccine design and construction.
6818,"Haemophilus parasuis causes Glässer's disease, a syndrome of polyserositis, meningitis, and arthritis in swine."
6819,Previous studies with H. parasuis have revealed virulence disparity among isolates and inconsistent heterologous protection.
6820,"In this study, virulence, direct transmission, and heterologous protection of 4 isolates of H. parasuis (SW114, 12939, MN-H, and 29755) were evaluated using a highly susceptible pig model."
6821,"In an initial experiment, isolates 12939, MN-H, and 29755 caused Glässer's disease, while strain SW114 failed to cause any clinical signs of disease."
6822,"One pig from each group challenged with MN-H or 29755 failed to develop clinical disease but was able to transmit H. parasuis to noninfected pigs, which subsequently developed Glässer's disease."
6823,"Pigs colonized with SW114, 29755, or MN-H that were free of clinical disease were protected from a subsequent challenge with isolate 12939."
6824,"In a following experiment, pigs vaccinated with strain SW114 given as either a bacterin intramuscularly or a live intranasal vaccine were protected from subsequent challenge with isolate 12939; however, some pigs given live SW114 developed arthritis."
6825,Overall these studies demonstrated that pigs infected with virulent isolates of H. parasuis can remain healthy and serve as reservoirs for transmission to naive pigs and that heterologous protection among H. parasuis isolates is possible.
6826,"In addition, further attenuation of strain SW114 is necessary if it is to be used as a live vaccine."
6827,"Antibodies, through passive or active immunization, play a central role in prophylaxis against many infectious agents."
6828,"While neutralization is a primary function of antibodies in protection against most viruses, the relative contribution of Fc-dependent and complement-dependent anti-viral activities of antibodies was found to vary between different viruses in recent studies."
6829,"The multiple hit model explains how antibodies neutralize viruses, and recent data on the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization suggest that the organization of viral surface proteins on viruses, in addition to virus size, influences the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization."
6830,These new findings will improve our strategies in therapeutic antibody engineering and rational vaccine design.
6831,"Vaccines based on live viruses are attractive because they are immunogenic, cost-effective, and can be delivered by multiple routes."
6832,"However, live virus vaccines also cause reactogenic side effects such as fever, myalgia, and injection site pain that have reduced their acceptance in the clinic."
6833,Several recent studies have linked vaccine-induced reactogenic side effects to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in humans.
6834,"Our objective was therefore to determine whether IL-1β contributed to pathology after immunization with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vectors, and if so, to identify strategies by which IL-1β mediated pathology might be reduced without compromising immunogenicity."
6835,"We found that an rVSV vaccine induced local and systemic production of IL-1β in vivo, and that accumulation of IL-1β correlated with acute pathology after rVSV immunization."
6836,"rVSV-induced pathology was reduced in mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor Type I, but the IL-1R−/− mice were fully protected from lethal rechallenge with a high dose of VSV."
6837,"This result demonstrated that IL-1 contributed to reactogenicity of the rVSV, but was dispensable for induction of protective immunity."
6838,"The amount of IL-1β detected in mice deficient in either caspase-1 or the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC after rVSV immunization was not significantly different than that produced by wild type animals, and caspase-1−/− and ASC−/− mice were only partially protected from rVSV-induced pathology."
6839,Those data support the idea that some of the IL-1β expressed in vivo in response to VSV may be activated by a caspase-1 and ASC-independent mechanism.
6840,"Together these results suggest that rVSV vectors engineered to suppress the induction of IL-1β, or signaling through the IL-1R would be less reactogenic in vivo, but would retain their immunogenicity and protective capacity."
6841,"Such rVSV would be highly desirable as either vaccine vectors or oncolytic therapies, and would likely be better tolerated in human vaccinees."
6842,"Respiratory disease in nursing calves is a common, yet sporadic herd event."
6843,"In herds that experience respiratory disease, this can be a frustrating experience."
6844,Beef cow operations have an expectation of losses during the calving season.
6845,"Losses because of respiratory disease in calves, that are at least 1 month up to weaning age, is not a normal expectation."
6846,Veterinarians providing services and advice to these operations must be able to present scientific and logical recommendations to manage these events.
6847,A strong working knowledge of the risk factors contributing to clinical disease is necessary to developing prevention strategies.
6848,": It is widely understood that tumor cells express tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), of which many are usually in low immunogenicity; for example, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is specifically expressed on human colon cancer cells and is viewed as a low-immunogenic TAA."
6849,How to activate host immunity against specific TAAs and to suppress tumor growth therefore becomes important in cancer therapy development.
6850,"RESULTS: To enhance the immune efficiency of CEA in mice that received, we fused a partial CEA gene with exogenous SARS-CoV fragments."
6851,Oral vaccination of an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain transformed with plasmids encoding CEA-SARS-CoV fusion gene into BALB/c mice elicited significant increases in TNF-α and IL-10 in the serum.
6852,"In addition, a smaller tumor volume was observed in CT26/CEA-bearing mice who received CEA-SARS-CoV gene therapy in comparison with those administered CEA alone."
6853,CONCLUSION: The administration of fusing CEA-SARS-CoV fragments may provide a promising strategy for strengthening the anti-tumor efficacy against low-immunogenic endogenous tumor antigens.
6854,Bats in the EU have been associated with several zoonotic viral pathogens of significance to both human and animal health.
6855,"Virus discovery continues to expand the existing understating of virus classification, and the increased interest in bats globally as reservoirs or carriers of zoonotic agents has fuelled the continued detection and characterisation of new lyssaviruses and other viral zoonoses."
6856,"Although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare, interest in these viruses remains, through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis—rabies."
6857,The association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest.
6858,"Much of the EU is free of terrestrial rabies, but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health."
6859,"Whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally, novel related viruses continue to be discovered, predominantly in bat populations, that are of interest purely through their classification within the lyssavirus genus alongside the rabies virus."
6860,"Although the rabies virus is principally transmitted from the bite of infected dogs, these related lyssaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans and terrestrial carnivores by bats."
6861,"Even though reports of zoonotic viruses from bats within the EU are rare, to protect human and animal health, it is important characterise novel bat viruses for several reasons, namely: (i) to investigate the mechanisms for the maintenance, potential routes of transmission, and resulting clinical signs, if any, in their natural hosts; (ii) to investigate the ability of existing vaccines, where available, to protect against these viruses; (iii) to evaluate the potential for spill over and onward transmission of viral pathogens in novel terrestrial hosts."
6862,"This review is an update on the current situation regarding zoonotic virus discovery within bats in the EU, and provides details of potential future mechanisms to control the threat from these deadly pathogens."
6863,"GALT is an important antigen of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), which was shown to provide partial protection against APP infection in a previous study in our lab."
6864,The main purpose of the present study is to investigate GALT induced cross-protection between different APP serotypes and elucidate key mechanisms of the immune response to GALT antigenic stimulation.
6865,"Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that galT is a highly conserved gene in APP, widely distributed across multiple pathogenic strains."
6866,Homologies between any two strains ranges from 78.9% to 100% regarding the galT locus.
6867,Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that GALT specific antibodies could not be induced by inactivated APP L20 or MS71 whole cell bacterin preparations.
6868,"A recombinant fusion GALT protein derived from APP L20, however has proven to be an effective cross-protective antigen against APP sevorar 1 MS71 (50%, 4/8) and APP sevorar 5b L20 (75%, 6/8)."
6869,Histopathological examinations have confirmed that recombinant GALT vaccinated animals showed less severe pathological signs in lung tissues than negative controls after APP challenge.
6870,Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that the infiltration of neutrophils in the negative group is significantly increased compared with that in the normal control (P<0.001) and that in surviving animals is decreased compared to the negative group.
6871,Anti-GALT antibodies were shown to mediate phagocytosis of neutrophils.
6872,"After interaction with anti-GALT antibodies, survival rate of APP challenged vaccinated animals was significantly reduced (P<0.001)."
6873,"This study demonstrated that GALT is an effective cross-protective antigen, which could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against multiple APP serotypes."
6874,Plants are able to perform post-translational maturations of therapeutic proteins required for their functional biological activity and suitable in vivo pharmacokinetics.
6875,"Plants can be a low-cost, large-scale production platform of recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins such as vaccines and antibodies."
6876,"Plants, however, lack mechanisms of processing authentic human N-glycosylation, which imposes a major limitation in their use as an expression system for therapeutic glycoproducts."
6877,"Efforts have been made to circumvent plant-specific N-glycosylation, as well as to supplement the plant's endogenous system with human glycosyltransferases for non-immunogenic and humanized N-glycan production."
6878,Herein we review studies on the potential of plants to serve as production systems for therapeutic and prophylactic biopharmaceuticals.
6879,We have especially focused on recombinant vaccines and antibodies and new expression strategies to overcome the existing problems associated with their production in plants.
6880,The sponsors of this report endorse carefully regulated research with nonhuman primates.
6881,"This research is essential to learning about the biology, treatment and prevention of diseases and conditions that cause human suffering."
6882, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease of the 21st century that has pandemic potential.
6883,A novel coronavirus (CoV) was identified as its aetiological agent and its genome was sequenced within months of the World Health Organisation issuing a global threat on SARS.
6884,The high morbidity and mortality of this potentially pandemic infection demands a rapid research response to develop effective antiviral treatment and vaccine.
6885,This will depend on understanding the pathogenesis and immune response to SARS CoV.
6886,Further understanding of the ecology of SARS CoV in human and animals will help prevent future cross species transmission.
6887,"Likewise for the super-spreading events, clarification of the underlying reasons will be important to prevent a large scale outbreak of SARS."
6888,Lastly it is of utmost importance that international research collaboration should be strengthened to deal with SARS and any other emerging infectious disease that can seriously threaten our future.
6889,: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a major pathogen of dogs and wild carnivores worldwide.
6890,"In Switzerland, distemper in domestic dogs is rarely reported."
6891,"In recent years, the import of dogs from Eastern Europe to Switzerland has steadily increased."
6892,"In the present study, we describe a distemper outbreak in 15 rescue dogs that were imported from Hungary to Switzerland by an animal welfare organisation."
6893,"The data on vaccination and medical history were recorded (14 dogs), and the samples were collected to investigate CDV and vector-borne infections (13 dogs) and canine parvovirus infection (12 dogs)."
6894,The dogs were monitored for six months.
6895,RESULTS: One dog was euthanised directly after import.
6896,"Thirteen dogs showed clinical signs after arrival, i.e., diarrhoea (57 %), coughing (43 %) and nasal and/or ocular discharge (21 %); radiographic findings that were compatible with bronchopneumonia were present in four dogs."
6897,CDV infection was diagnosed in 11 dogs (85 %); 10 dogs (91 %) tested PCR-positive in conjunctival swabs.
6898,"Vector-borne infections (Babesia spp., Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis) were found in 4 dogs (31 %)."
6899,"Three dogs were hospitalized, and six dogs received ambulatory therapy for up to two months until recovery."
6900,None of the dogs developed neurological disease.
6901,CDV shedding was detected for a period of up to four months.
6902,"Because dogs were put under strict quarantine until CDV shedding ceased, CDV did not spread to any other dogs."
6903,The CDV isolates showed 99 % sequence identity in the HA gene among each other and belonged to the Arctic-like lineage of CDV.
6904,CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the imminent risks of spreading contagious viral and vector-borne infections through the non-selective import of sick dogs and dogs with incomplete vaccination from Eastern Europe.
6905,"CDV shedding was detected for several months after the cessation of clinical signs, which emphasised the roles of asymptomatic carriers in CDV epidemiology."
6906,A long-term follow-up using sensitive PCR and strict quarantine measures is of upmost importance in preventing the spread of infection.
6907,Dog owners and animal welfare organisations should be educated regarding the importance of complete vaccinations and the impact of dog imports on the spread of viral and vector-borne pathogens.
6908,"Two novel coronaviruses have emerged in humans in the 21(st) century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome human coronavirus (MERS-CoV), both of which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and have high mortality rates."
6909,"There are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for either of these infections; thus, a priority in the field is the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies that can be readily applied to new emergent strains."
6910,"This review will: describe the emergence and identification of novel human coronaviruses over the last 10 years; review their key biological features, including tropism and receptor use; and summarize approaches to develop broadly effective vaccines."
6911, The present study is undertaken to investigate the immune response that was induced by the recombinant spike (S) protein from swine-transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) expressed in mouse mammary cells.
6912,A mammary-specific expression vector pEBS containing the full-length cDNA of S gene was constructed and expressed in the mouse mammary cells (EMT6).
6913,The recombinant S protein from culture supernatant of transgenic EMT6 was harvested and immunized BALB/c mice.
6914,The results demonstrated recombinant S protein was expressed at high levels in mammary cells by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection.
6915,The antibody titer in BALB/c mice following immunization with recombinant S protein was detectable after the first immunization.
6916,Maximum titers of antibody (8.86±0.19ng/ml of serum) were attained after the second immunization.
6917,"In conclusion, the recombinant S protein expressed in mammary cells was able to elicit substantial immunological response against TGEV."
6918,This lays the basis for using mammary gland bioreactor generating edible vaccine.
6919,"Although vaccines against influenza A virus are the most effective method to combat infection, it is clear that their production needs to be accelerated and their efficacy improved."
6920,We generated live attenuated human influenza A vaccines (LAIVs) by rationally engineering mutations directly into the genome of a pandemic-H1N1 virus.
6921,Two LAIVs (NS1-73 and NS1-126) were based on the success of LAIVs for animal influenza A viruses.
6922,A third candidate (NSΔ5) is a unique NS-mutant that has never been used as a LAIV.
6923,"The vaccine potential of each LAIV was determined through analysis of attenuation, interferon production, immunogenicity, and their ability to protect mice and ferrets."
6924,"This study demonstrates that NSΔ5 is an ideal LAIV candidate, provides important information on the effects that different NS mutations have on the pandemic-H1N1 virus and shows that LAIVs can be engineered directly from the genomes of emerging/circulating influenza A viruses."
6925, Influenza virus research has recently undergone a shift from a virus-centric perspective to one that embraces the full spectrum of virus–host interactions and cellular signaling events that determine disease outcome.
6926,"This change has been brought about by the increasing use and expanding scope of high-throughput molecular profiling and computational biology, which together fuel discovery in systems biology."
6927,"In this review, we show how these approaches have revealed an uncontrolled inflammatory response as a contributor to the extreme virulence of the 1918 pandemic and avian H5N1 viruses, and how this response differs from that induced by the 2009 H1N1 viruses responsible for the most recent influenza pandemic."
6928,"We also discuss how new animal models, such as the Collaborative Cross mouse systems genetics platform, are key to the necessary systematic investigation of the impact of host genetics on infection outcome, how genome-wide RNAi screens have identified hundreds of cellular factors involved in viral replication, and how systems biology approaches are making possible the rational design of new drugs and vaccines against an ever-evolving respiratory virus."
6929,"While dispensable for viral replication, coronavirus (CoV) accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins often play critical roles during infection and pathogenesis."
6930,"Utilizing a previously generated mutant, we demonstrate that the absence of all four Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) accessory ORFs (deletion of ORF3, -4a, -4b, and -5 [dORF3-5]) has major implications for viral replication and pathogenesis."
6931,"Importantly, attenuation of the dORF3-5 mutant is primarily driven by dysregulated host responses, including disrupted cell processes, augmented interferon (IFN) pathway activation, and robust inflammation."
6932,"In vitro replication attenuation also extends to in vivo models, allowing use of dORF3-5 as a live attenuated vaccine platform."
6933,"Finally, examination of ORF5 implicates a partial role in modulation of NF-κB-mediated inflammation."
6934,"Together, the results demonstrate the importance of MERS-CoV accessory ORFs for pathogenesis and highlight them as potential targets for surveillance and therapeutic treatments moving forward."
6935,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic virus considered as one of the major public threat with a total number of 2 298 laboratory-confirmed cases and 811 associated deaths reported by World Health Organization as of January 2019.
6936,The transmission of the virus was expected to be from the camels found in Middle Eastern countries via the animal and human interaction.
6937,The genome structure provided information about the pathogenicity and associated virulent factors present in the virus.
6938,Recent studies suggested that there were limited insight available on the development of novel therapeutic strategies to induce immunity against the virus.
6939,The severities of MERS-CoV infection highlight the necessity of effective approaches for the development of various therapeutic remedies.
6940,"Thus, the present review comprehensively and critically illustrates the recent aspects on the epidemiology of the virus, the structural and functional features of the viral genome, viral entry and transmission, major mechanisms of pathogenesis and associated virulent factors, current animal models, detection methods and novel strategies for the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV."
6941,The review further illustrates the molecular and computational virtual screening platforms which provide insights for the identification of putative drug targets and novel lead molecules toward the development of therapeutic remedies.
6942,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people in Africa, Europe, and Asia1,2 since its re-emergence in Kenya in 2004."
6943,The severity of disease and spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or anti-viral therapies.
6944,"Here, we describe a novel vaccine that protects against emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates (NHP)."
6945,We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses.
6946,Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from different CHIKV strains.
6947,Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high dose challenge.
6948,"We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, establishing a humoral mechanism of protection."
6949,Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans.
6950,"Marek’s Disease Virus (MDV) is the causative agent of a lymphoproliferative disease, Marek’s disease (MD) in chickens."
6951,"MD is only controlled by mass vaccination; however, immunity induced by MD vaccines is unable to prevent MDV replication and transmission."
6952,The herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) vaccine is one of the most widely used MD vaccines in poultry industry.
6953,Vaccines can be adjuvanted with Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-Ls) to enhance their efficacy.
6954,"In this study, we examined whether combining TLR-Ls with HVT can boost host immunity against MD and improve its efficacy."
6955,Results demonstrated that HVT alone or HVT combined with encapsulated CpG-ODN partially protected chickens from tumor incidence and reduced virus replication compared to the control group.
6956,"However, encapsulated CpG-ODN only moderately, but not significantly, improved HVT efficacy and reduced tumor incidence from 53% to 33%."
6957,Further investigation of cytokine gene profiles in spleen and bursa of Fabricius revealed an inverse association between interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-18 expression and protection conferred by different treatments.
6958,"In addition, the results of this study raise the possibility that interferon (IFN)-β and IFN-γ induced by the treatments may exert anti-viral responses against MDV replication in the bursa of Fabricius at early stage of MDV infection in chickens."
6959,The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a well-established model system for understanding fundamental cellular processes relevant to higher eukaryotic organisms.
6960,"Less known is its value for virus research, an area in which Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be very fruitful as well."
6961,The present review will discuss the main achievements of yeast-based studies in basic and applied virus research.
6962,"These include the analysis of the function of individual proteins from important pathogenic viruses, the elucidation of key processes in viral replication through the development of systems that allow the replication of higher eukayotic viruses in yeast, and the use of yeast in antiviral drug development and vaccine production."
6963,"Since their discovery as a tool for gene transfer, vectors derived from the adeno-associated virus (AAV) have been used for gene therapy applications and attracted scientist to this field for their exceptional properties of efficiency of in vivo gene transfer and the level and duration of transgene expression."
6964,"For many years, AAVs have been considered as low immunogenic vectors due to their ability to induce long-term expression of non-self-proteins in contrast to what has been observed with other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, for which strong immune responses against the same transgene products were documented."
6965,The perceived low immunogenicity likely explains why the use of AAV vectors for vaccination was not seriously considered before the early 2000s.
6966,"Indeed, while analyses conducted using a variety of transgenes and animal species slowly changed the vision of immunological properties of AAVs, an increasing number of studies were also performed in the field of vaccination."
6967,"Even if the comparison with other modes of vaccination was not systemically performed, the analyses conducted so far in the field of active immunotherapy strongly suggest that AAVs possess some interesting features to be used as tools to produce an efficient and sustained antibody response."
6968,"In addition, recent studies also highlighted the potential of AAVs for passive immunotherapy."
6969,This review summarizes the main studies conducted to evaluate the potential of AAV vectors for vaccination against infectious agents and discusses their advantages and drawbacks.
6970,"Altogether, the variety of studies conducted in this field contributes to the understanding of the immunological properties of this versatile virus and to the definition of its possible future applications."
6971,"Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic virus that is transmitted by bats to humans and to pigs, causing severe respiratory disease and often fatal encephalitis."
6972,Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity.
6973,"More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection."
6974,"So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells."
6975,"In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses."
6976,"Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR−/−) mice after vaccination with the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines."
6977,We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein.
6978,The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection.
6979,"Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides."
6980,"To investigate CTL epitope applications in swine, SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains were explored by crystallography, biochemistry, and the specific pathogen-free (SPF) swine experiments."
6981,"First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined."
6982,The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes.
6983,Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper.
6984,The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding.
6985,"Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide."
6986,The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined.
6987,"Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated."
6988,"The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group."
6989,NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-γ expression.
6990,Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.
6991,A scenario tree model was developed to propose efficient bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) control measures.
6992,"The model used field data in eastern Hokkaido where the risk of BVDV infection in cattle has been reduced by an eradication program including mass vaccination, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing, herd screening tests using bulk milk, and outbreak investigations of newly infected herds."
6993,These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation.
6994,"In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures."
6995,"The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle."
6996,"Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds."
6997,"When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests."
6998,"Considering the model outputs together, the scenario tree model developed in the present study was useful to compare the efficacy of the control measures for BVD."
6999, The use of plants for medicinal purposes dates back thousands of years but genetic engineering of plants to produce desired biopharmaceuticals is much more recent.
7000,"As the demand for biopharmaceuticals is expected to increase, it would be wise to ensure that they will be available in significantly larger amounts, on a cost-effective basis."
7001,"Currently, the cost of biopharmaceuticals limits their availability."
7002,"Plant-derived biopharmaceuticals are cheap to produce and store, easy to scale up for mass production, and safer than those derived from animals."
7003,"Here, we discuss recent developments in this field and possible environmental concerns."
7004,Plasmid DNA (pDNA) gene delivery is a highly versatile technology that has the potential to address a multitude of unmet medical needs.
7005,Advances in pDNA delivery to host tissue with the employment of in vivo electroporation (EP) have led to significantly enhanced gene expression and the recent demonstration of clinical efficacy with the platform.
7006,"Building upon this platform, this study reports that enzyme-mediated modification of the muscle tissue extracellular matrix structure at the site of pDNA delivery operates in a synergistic manner with EP to enhance both local and systemic gene expression further."
7007,"Specifically, administration of chondroitinase ABC (Cho ABC) to the site of intramuscular delivery of pDNA led to transient disruption of chondroitin sulfate scaffolding barrier, permitting enhanced gene distribution and expression across the tissue."
7008,The employment of Cho ABC in combination with CELLECTRA(®) intramuscular EP resulted in increased gene expression by 5.5-fold in mice and 17.98-fold in rabbits.
7009,"The study demonstrates how this protocol can be universally applied to an active prophylaxis platform to increase the in vivo production of functional immunoglobulin G, and to DNA vaccine protocols to permit drug dose sparing."
7010,The data indicate the Cho ABC formulation to be of significant value upon combination with EP to drive enhanced gene expression levels in pDNA delivery protocols.
7011," The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is currently spreading among humans, making development of effective MERS vaccines a high priority."
7012,A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) in MERS-CoV spike protein can potentially serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infections.
7013,"To identify an ideal vaccine candidate, we have constructed five different versions of RBD fragments, S350-588-Fc, S358-588-Fc, S367-588-Fc, S367-606-Fc, and S377-588-Fc (their names indicate their residue range in the spike protein and their C-terminal Fc tag), and further investigated their receptor binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential."
7014,The results showed that S377-588-Fc is among the RBD fragments that demonstrated the highest DPP4-binding affinity and induced the highest-titer IgG antibodies in mice.
7015,"In addition, S377-588-Fc elicited higher-titer neutralizing antibodies than all the other RBD fragments in mice, and also induced high-titer neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits."
7016,"Structural analysis suggests that S377-588-Fc contains the stably folded RBD structure, the full receptor-binding site, and major neutralizing epitopes, such that additional structures to this fragment introduce non-neutralizing epitopes and may also alter the tertiary structure of the RBD."
7017,"Taken together, our data suggest that the RBD fragment encompassing spike residues 377-588 is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding fragment and an ideal candidate for development of effective MERS vaccines, and that adding non-neutralizing structures to this RBD fragment diminishes its neutralizing potential."
7018,"Therefore, in viral vaccine design, it is important to identify the most stable and neutralizing viral RBD fragment, while eliminating unnecessary and non-neutralizing structures, as a means of “immunofocusing”."
7019,"Today, immune compromised interferon-α-receptor deficient mice expressing hCD46 (IFNARCD46tg) are usually used for measles virus (MV) based vaccine characterization."
7020,"However, for the development of MV-based recombinant vaccine candidates (rMV), an immune competent mouse model is desirable in order to induce and evaluate meaningful immune response."
7021,"In this study, humoral and cellular immune response induced by rMV in immune competent mice expressing human MV receptor CD46 (hCD46tg) were compared with those induced in wild-type black/6, and IFNARCD46tg mice."
7022,"All three strains developed humoral and cellular response against MV, whereas only hCD46tg and IFNARCD46tg mice developed a humoral response against the transgene."
7023,"Differences were observed in the magnitude of the response, where the IFNARCD46tg mice displayed the strongest immune responses, followed by the hCD46tg mice and the black/6 mice."
7024,"Interestingly, hCD46tg and wt black/6 mice showed a predominant CD4(+) T-cell response against MV-N, whereas IFNARCD46tg mice developed both, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell response against MV-N."
7025,Analysis of the cytokine profile of MV-N specific CD4(+) T-cells and transgene (SIVgag) specific CD8(+) T-cells revealed qualitative differences of the T-cell responses; noticeably a significant reduction of the frequency of CD4(+)IL-2(+) expressing cells in IFNARCD46tg mice as compared with hCD46tg or wt black/6 mice.
7026,We show in this study significant quantitative and qualitative differences in immune responses between immune competent and immune-compromised mice.
7027,Our results therefore highlight the importance of the animal model and support the use of hCD46tg mice as mouse model for the characterization of the immunological profile induced by recombinant measles virus vaccine candidates.
7028,"Immunization with attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) has been shown to be protective, but the features of the antibody response induced by this treatment remain unclear."
7029,"To investigate this response at high resolution, we isolated IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies from Tanzanian volunteers who were immunized by repeated injection of irradiated PfSPZ and who were found to be protected from controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with infectious homologous PfSPZ."
7030,"All IgG monoclonals isolated bound to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in the N-terminus, NANP repeat region, and C-terminus."
7031,"Strikingly, the most effective antibodies, as assessed in a humanized mouse model, bound not only to the repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal junction that is not in the RTS,S vaccine."
7032,These dual-specific antibodies were isolated from different donors and used VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles carrying tryptophan or arginine at position 52.
7033,"Using structural and mutational data, we describe the elements required for germline recognition and affinity maturation."
7034,Our study provides potent neutralizing antibodies and relevant information for lineage-targeted vaccine design and immunization strategies.
7035,": Despite the development of various systems to generate live recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains, little work has been performed to systematically evaluate and compare their relative immunogenicity."
7036,Such information would provide invaluable guidance for the future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines.
7037,"RESULT: To compare vaccine strains encoded with different antigen delivery and expression strategies, a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the H5N1 influenza virus, as model antigens."
7038,"The antigens were expressed from the chromosome, from high or low-copy plasmids, or encoded on a eukaryotic expression plasmid."
7039,Antigens were targeted for expression in either the cytoplasm or the outer membrane.
7040,Combinations of strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of combined delivery/expression approaches.
7041,"After investigating in vitro and in vivo antigen expression, growth and infection abilities; the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains was evaluated in mice."
7042,"Using the soluble model antigen EGFP, our results indicated that vaccine strains with high and stable antigen expression exhibited high B cell responses, whilst eukaryotic expression or colonization with good construct stability was critical for T cell responses."
7043,"For the insoluble model antigen HA, an outer membrane expression strategy induced better B cell and T cell responses than a cytoplasmic strategy."
7044,"Most notably, the combination of two different expression strategies did not increase the immune response elicited."
7045,"CONCLUSION: Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages and deleterious or synergistic effects."
7046,Different construction strategies were optimally-required for soluble versus insoluble forms of the protein antigens.
7047,"If an antigen, such as EGFP, is soluble and expressed at high levels, a low-copy plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy is recommended; since it provokes the highest B cell responses and also induces good T cell responses."
7048,"If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic expression plasmid or a chromosome-based, cytoplasmic-expression strategy is more effective."
7049,"For insoluble antigens such as HA, an outer membrane expression strategy is recommended."
7050,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of respiratory tract disease in infants and the elderly.
7051,"Currently, no licensed vaccine against RSV is available."
7052,Here we describe the development of a safe and effective intranasal subunit vaccine that is based on recombinant fusion (F) protein bound to the surface of immunostimulatory bacterium-like particles (BLPs) derived from the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis.
7053,"Different variants of F were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies, assuming that F proteins mimicking the metastable prefusion form of RSV F expose a more extensive and relevant epitope repertoire than F proteins corresponding to the postfusion structure."
7054,"Our results indicate that the recombinant soluble ectodomain of RSV F readily adopts a postfusion conformation, generation of which cannot be prevented by C-terminal addition of a trimerization motif, but whose formation is prevented by mutation of the two furin cleavage sites in F. While the putative postfusion form of F is recognized well by the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, this is much less so for the more potently neutralizing, prefusion-specific antibodies D25 and AM22."
7055,"Both addition of the trimerization motif and mutation of the furin cleavage sites increased the reactivity of F with D25 and AM22, with the highest reactivity being observed for F proteins in which both these features were combined."
7056,"Intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs loaded with this latter prefusion-like F protein (BLP-F), resulted in the potent induction of F-specific immunoglobulins and in significantly decreased virus titers in the lungs upon RSV challenge."
7057,"Moreover, and in contrast to animals vaccinated with formalin-inactivated RSV, animals that received BLP-F exhibited high levels of F-specific secretory IgA in the nose and RSV-neutralizing antibodies in sera, but did not show symptoms of enhanced disease after challenge with RSV."
7058, The causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) following the outbreak of 2002–2003.
7059,There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections.
7060,Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models.
7061,The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly.
7062,"We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model."
7063,"These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice."
7064,This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis.
7065,Surface layer proteins of probiotic lactobacilli are theoretically efficient epitope-displaying scaffolds for oral vaccine delivery due to their high expression levels and surface localization.
7066,"In this study, we constructed genetically modified Lactobacillus acidophilus strains expressing the membrane proximal external region (MPER) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the context of the major S-layer protein, SlpA."
7067,Intragastric immunization of mice with the recombinants induced MPER-specific and S-layer protein-specific antibodies in serum and mucosal secretions.
7068,"Moreover, analysis of systemic SlpA-specific cytokines revealed that the responses appeared to be Th1 and Th17 dominant."
7069,These findings demonstrated the potential use of the Lactobacillus S-layer protein for development of oral vaccines targeting specific peptides.
7070, Interest in the use of marmosets for experimental infectious disease has dramatically increased in the last decade.
7071,These animals are native to the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil.
7072,The majority of experimental animals come from the National Primate Research Centers and other breeding facilities.
7073,"They are advantageous because of their relative small size, weighting 350–400g as adults, their life span is compact compared with other nonhuman primate (NHP), and they produce offspring by 3years of age."
7074,"They are free of Herpes B virus and, it is believed, to date, other dangerous human pathogens (Abbot et al., 2003) [1]."
7075,We describe here the experimental infections of marmosets to human pathogens.
7076,"While it is always interesting to compare various NHPs with each other, the importance of an animal model is always in comparing its similarities to human infections."
7077," A reverse vaccinology system, Vaxign, was used to identify and select a subset of five African Swine Fever (ASF) antigens that were successfully purified from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells and produced in Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) viral vectors."
7078,"Three HEK-purified antigens [B646L (p72), E183L (p54), and O61R (p12)], and three MVA-vectored antigens [B646L, EP153R, and EP402R (CD2v)] were evaluated using a prime-boost immunization regimen swine safety and immunogenicity study."
7079,"Antibody responses were detected in pigs following prime-boost immunization four weeks apart with the HEK-293-purified p72, p54, and p12 antigens."
7080,"Notably, sera from the vaccinees were positive by immunofluorescence on ASFV (Georgia 2007/1)-infected primary macrophages."
7081,"Although MVA-vectored p72, CD2v, and EP153R failed to induce antibody responses, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ+) spot forming cell responses against all three antigens were detected one week post-boost."
7082,The highest IFN-γ+ spot forming cell responses were detected against p72 in pigs primed with MVA-p72 and boosted with the recombinant p72.
7083,"Antigen-specific (p12, p72, CD2v, and EP153R) T-cell proliferative responses were also detected post-boost."
7084,"Collectively, these results are the first demonstration that ASFV subunit antigens purified from mammalian cells or expressed in MVA vectors are safe and can induce ASFV-specific antibody and T-cell responses following a prime-boost immunization regimen in swine."
7085,"When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first came to world attention in March 2003, it was immediately perceived to be a global threat with a pandemic potential."
7086,"To help coordinate international research efforts, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases convened a colloquium entitled SARS: Developing a Research Response on 30 May 2003."
7087,"Breakout sessions intended to identify unmet research needs in 5 areas of SARS research—clinical research, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines—are summarized here."
7088,"Since this meeting, however, the identified research needs have been only partially met."
7089,"Needs that have yet to be realized include reliable methods for early identification of individuals with SARS, a full description of SARS pathogenesis and immune response, and animal models that faithfully mimic SARS respiratory symptoms."
7090,"It is also of the utmost importance that the global scientific community enhance mechanisms for international cooperation and planning for SARS research, as well as for other emerging infectious disease threats that are certain to arise in the future."
7091, & OBJECTIVES: Pre-clinical toxicology evaluation of biotechnology products is a challenge to the toxicologist.
7092,"The present investigation is an attempt to evaluate the safety profile of the first indigenously developed recombinant DNA anti-rabies vaccine [DRV (100 μg)] and combination rabies vaccine [CRV (100 μg DRV and 1.25 IU of cell culture-derived inactivated rabies virus vaccine)], which are intended for clinical use by intramuscular route in Rhesus monkeys."
7093,"METHODS: As per the regulatory requirements, the study was designed for acute (single dose - 14 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose - 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose - 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels, viz."
7094,"therapeutic, average (2x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in monkeys."
7095,The selection of the model i.e.
7096,monkey was based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies.
7097,"An attempt was made to evaluate all parameters which included physical, physiological, clinical, haematological and histopathological profiles of all target organs, as well as Tiers I, II, III immunotoxicity parameters."
7098,RESULTS: In acute toxicity there was no mortality in spite of exposing the monkeys to 10XDRV.
7099,"In sub chronic and chronic toxicity studies there were no abnormalities in physical, physiological, neurological, clinical parameters, after administration of test compound in intended and 10 times of clinical dosage schedule of DRV and CRV under the experimental conditions."
7100,"Clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights and histopathology studies were essentially unremarkable except the presence of residual DNA in femtogram level at site of injection in animal which received 10X DRV in chronic toxicity study."
7101,"No Observational Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) of DRV is 1000 ug/dose (10 times of therapeutic dose) if administered on 0, 4, 7, 14, 28(th) day."
7102,INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The information generated by this study not only draws attention to the need for national and international regulatory agencies in formulating guidelines for pre-clinical safety evaluation of biotech products but also facilitates the development of biopharmaceuticals as safe potential therapeutic agents.
7103, Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a highly contagious cause of serious and often fatal disease in dogs worldwide despite the availability of safe and efficacious vaccines.
7104,"Although a number of studies have focussed on identifying risk factors in disease development, risk factors associated with death from CPV are largely unknown."
7105,In this study we analysed a total of 1451 CPV cases reported from an Australian surveillance system – using univariate and multivariate techniques – to determine significant risk factors associated with death and euthanasia.
7106,A crude case fatality rate of 42.3% was estimated – higher than has been reported previously.
7107,"We found that 3.3% of CPV cases had a history of vaccination in the previous 12 months, despite having completed the primary puppy vaccination course."
7108,"The majority (89.5%) of these cases occurred in dogs <12 months of age, indicating failure of the primary vaccination course to provide protective immunity (most likely due to interference of the vaccine antigen with maternal antibodies but other reasons are discussed)."
7109,Extending the age at which the final puppy vaccination is administered might be one of several strategies to consider.
7110,"The final multivariate model showed that in non-litter CPV cases, risk of death was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer) and pedigree type (hounds and non-sporting dogs)."
7111,"Euthanasia in non-litter CPV cases was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer), state of residence (Northern Territory/South Australia/Tasmania combined), age (<six months) and vaccination status (unvaccinated and unknown)."
7112,No significant risk factors associated with death were identified in cases in which there was more than one puppy in a litter infected.
7113,The risk factors identified in this study can be used as prognostic indicators for veterinarians faced with CPV cases.
7114,The possible explanations for the associations identified and their clinical relevance to CPV case outcome are discussed
7115,"Highlights from the 6th International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED 2016) Vienna, Austria from Nov 3 to 7, 2016"
7116,"Vaccination is highly effective in preventing various infectious diseases, whereas the constant threat of new emerging pathogens necessitates the development of innovative vaccination principles that also confer rapid protection in a case of emergency."
7117,"Although increasing evidence points to T cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases, vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses."
7118,Here we analyze the immunological mechanism(s) of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox.
7119,We found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on CD4 and CD8 T cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or conventional vaccinia virus.
7120,"Of note, CD4 T cells were critically required to allow for MVA induced CD8 T cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of MVA induced protection."
7121,"In contrast, selected components of the innate immune system and B cell-mediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge."
7122,"In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that perforin-dependent CD8 T cell immunity plays a key role in MVA conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox."
7123,Rapid induction of T cell immunity might serve as a new paradigm for treatments that need to fit into a scenario of protective emergency vaccination.
7124, Development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is crucial in the prevention of SARS reemergence.
7125,The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is an important target in developing safe and effective SARS vaccines.
7126,Our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adeno-associated virus encoding RBD (RBD-rAAV) induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies.
7127,"In this study, we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-specific T cell peptide boost."
7128,"Compared with the RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccination, RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide (RBD-Pep) boost induced similar levels of Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge, but stronger Th2 and CTL responses."
7129,No significant immune responses and protective effects were detected in mice vaccinated with RBD-Pep or blank AAV alone.
7130,"Since T cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory T cells, which may be effective against viruses with mutations in the neutralizing epitopes, our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective, broad and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection."
7131,DNA vaccines delivered subcutaneously by gene-gun have generated strong protective and therapeutic immunity in rabbits.
7132,Recent studies have shown that peptides delivered by the mucosal routes also stimulate local and systemic immune responses.
7133,"Since mucosal delivery is easier to administer and more cost-effective when compared to gene-gun delivery, we were interested to learn whether mucosally-delivered peptides would prime protective immunity comparable to that of gene-gun delivered DNA in rabbits."
7134,Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model was used to test the hypothesis.
7135,"We chose an HLA-A2.1 restricted cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) E1 epitope (E1/303–311, MLQEKPFQL) for the peptide immunization studies because it provided complete protection when used as a DNA vaccine."
7136,Adjuvant has been widely used to boost immunity for vaccines.
7137,"In this study, three adjuvants reported to be effective for rabbits (TT helper motif, PADRE and CpG2007) were tested with the peptide vaccine."
7138,Peptide alone or fused to TT helper or PADRE to create chimeric peptides was delivered by two mucosal routes (ocular and intranasal) together.
7139,Partial protection was found in HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits when peptide was delivered mucosally in the presence of adjuvant.
7140,"When a subsequent booster of a half dose of the corresponding DNA vaccine was delivered, complete protections were achieved."
7141,We conclude that mucosal peptide immunization can be combined with a single DNA vaccination to provide strong protective immunity in rabbits.
7142, Experimental infection studies with bluetongue virus (BTV) in the mammalian host have a history that stretches back to the late 18th century.
7143,"Studies in a wide range of ruminant and camelid species as well as mice have been instrumental in understanding BTV transmission, bluetongue (BT) pathogenicity/pathogenesis, viral virulence, the induced immune response, as well as reproductive failures associated with BTV infection."
7144,These studies have in many cases been complemented by in vitro studies with BTV in different cell types in tissue culture.
7145,"Together these studies have formed the basis for the understanding of BTV-host interaction and have contributed to the design of successful control strategies, including the development of effective vaccines."
7146,This review describes some of the fundamental and contemporary infection studies that have been conducted with BTV in the mammalian host and provides an overview of the principal animal welfare issues that should be considered when designing experimental infection studies with BTV in in vivo infection models.
7147,"Examples are provided from the authors’ own laboratory where the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) have been implemented in the design of experimental infection studies with BTV in mice and goats."
7148,The use of the ARRIVE guidelines for the reporting of data from animal infection studies is emphasized.
7149, The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first discovered in late 2012 and has gone on to cause over 1800 infections and 650 deaths.
7150,There are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccinations for MERS-CoV.
7151,"The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells, is immunodominant and induces neutralizing antibodies in vivo, all of which, make the S protein an ideal target for anti-MERS-CoV vaccines."
7152,"In this study, we demonstrate protection induced by vaccination with a recombinant MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine and Matrix-M1 adjuvant combination in mice."
7153,The MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine produced high titer anti-S neutralizing antibody and protected mice from MERS-CoV infection in vivo.
7154,The objective of this study to design a delivery system resistant to the gastrointestinal environment for oral vaccine against porcine rotavirus.
7155,"Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 was transformed with segments of vP4 of the porcine rotavirus inserted into the pNZ8112 surface-expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis expressing VP4 protein was constructed."
7156,"An approximately 27 kDa VP4 protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE , Western blot and immunostaining analysis."
7157,"BALB/c mice were immunized orally with VP4-expression recombinant L. lactis and cellular, mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses were examined."
7158,"Specific anti-VP4 secretory IgA and IgG were found in feces, ophthalmic and vaginal washes and in serum."
7159,The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on porcine rotavirus infection on MA104 cells.
7160,Our findings suggest that oral immunization with VP4-expressing L. lactis induced both specific local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.
7161, Various technological developments have revitalized the approaches employed to study the disease of rabies.
7162,"In particular, reverse genetics has facilitated the generation of novel viruses used to improve our understanding of the fundamental aspects of rabies virus (RABV) biology and pathogenicity and yielded novel constructs potentially useful as vaccines against rabies and other diseases."
7163,Other techniques such as high throughput methods to examine the impact of rabies virus infection on host cell gene expression and two hybrid systems to explore detailed protein–protein interactions also contribute substantially to our understanding of virus–host interactions.
7164,This review summarizes much of the increased knowledge about rabies that has resulted from such studies but acknowledges that this is still insufficient to allow rational attempts at curing those who present with clinical disease.
7165,We generated a new live-attenuated vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) based on a chimeric virus HPIV3/ΔF-HN/EboGP that contains the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) as the sole transmembrane envelope protein combined with the internal proteins of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3).
7166,Electron microscopy analysis of the virus particles showed that they have an envelope and surface spikes resembling those of EBOV and a particle size and shape resembling those of HPIV3.
7167,"When HPIV3/ΔF-HN/EboGP was inoculated via apical surface of an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, the virus was released from the apical surface; when applied to basolateral surface, the virus infected basolateral cells but did not spread through the tissue."
7168,"Following intranasal (IN) inoculation of guinea pigs, scattered infected cells were detected in the lungs by immunohistochemistry, but infectious HPIV3/ΔF-HN/EboGP could not be recovered from the lungs, blood, or other tissues."
7169,"Despite the attenuation, the virus was highly immunogenic, and a single IN dose completely protected the animals against a highly lethal intraperitoneal challenge of guinea pig-adapted EBOV."
7170, Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is a non-invasive and easy-to-use vaccination method.
7171,We demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a transcutaneous vaccine formulation using a hydrogel patch in animal experiments.
7172,"In the present study, we performed a clinical study to apply our TCI formulation for vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria in human."
7173,The TCI device was a hydrogel patch (antigen-free) applied to the left brachial medial skin of 22 healthy volunteers for 48h.
7174,"Next, the hydrogel patch, containing 2mg tetanus toxoid (TT) and 2mg diphtheria toxoid (DT) as the TCI formulation, was applied to 27 healthy volunteers for 24h and some volunteers were vaccinated again by TCI formulation."
7175,"For safety assessment, the patch application site was observed to assess local adverse events, and systemic adverse events were determined by a blood test."
7176,The antigen-free hydrogel patch and TCI formulation containing TT and DT did not induce local or systemic severe adverse events.
7177,"For vaccine efficacy estimation, toxoid-specific serum antibody titers were determined by ELISA and the toxin-neutralizing activity of the induced antibody was evaluated in a passive-challenge experiment."
7178,"The anti-TT IgG titer and the anti-DT IgG titer increased, and a significant effect was detected by paired t-test."
7179,The antibody titers were maintained at higher level than that before vaccination for at least 1 year.
7180,"Moreover, toxoid-specific antibodies were produced by the second vaccination in some subjects."
7181,Antibodies induced by application of the TCI formulation neutralized the toxin and prevented toxic death in mice.
7182,"In addition, changes in the skin condition due to application of the TCI formulation were observed under in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy."
7183,"The amount of water and patch components in the stratum corneum increased after application of the TCI formulation, suggesting that the change in the skin condition was related to antigen penetration."
7184,These data indicate that this easy-to-use TCI system induces an immune response without severe adverse reactions in humans.
7185,"This easy-to-use and safe TCI formulation enables mass treatment in an outbreak setting and increased vaccination rates in developing countries, and will greatly contribute to worldwide countermeasures against infectious diseases."
7186,Background.
7187,Animal models suggest that influenza infection favors nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci.
7188,We assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children.
7189,Methods.
7190,A case-control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Andean children <3 years of age (RESPIRA-PERU study).
7191,Weekly household visits were made to identify ARI and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
7192,Monthly nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization.
7193,We determined whether specific respiratory viral ARI episodes occurring within the interval between NP samples increased the risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes.
7194,Results.
7195,"A total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation, including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes (new serotype, not detected in prior sample), 1029 nonacquisition episodes (no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample), and 418 indeterminate episodes."
7196,"The risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza-ARI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–4.69) and parainfluenza-ARI (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15–3.01), when compared with episodes without ARI."
7197,"Other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were not associated with acquisition."
7198,Conclusions.
7199,Influenza and parainfluenza ARIs appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children.
7200,"As acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases, these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease."
7201,"Pancreatic cancer is the 5(th) leading cause of cancer deaths, and there are no effective treatments."
7202,We developed a poxvirus platform vaccine with improved immunogenicity and inserted the mesothelin gene to create an anti-mesothelin cancer vaccine.
7203,Mesothelin expression is mostly restricted to tumors in adult mammals and thus may be a good target for cancer treatment.
7204,We show here that the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing mesothelin and the enhanced MVA virus missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene and expressing mesothelin were both safe in mice and were able to induce IFN-gamma secreting T cells in response to mesothelin expressing tumor cells.
7205,"In addition, the MVA virus has oncolytic properties in vitro as it can replicate in and kill Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line tumor cells, even though it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells."
7206,Deletion of the A35 gene in MVA improved T cell responses as expected.
7207,"However, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of Panc02 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice with pre-vaccination of mice, boosts, or even intratumoral injections of the recombinant viruses."
7208,Vaccine efficacy may be limited by shedding of mesothelin from tumor cells thus creating a protective screen from the immune system.
7209," The effect of vaccinating pregnant cows with an inactivated vaccine against Mannheimia haemolytica, BRSV and PI3V infections on selected immune responses in their offspring was examined."
7210,Blood samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks from six newborn calves from each of vaccinated (experimental) and unvaccinated (control) dams.
7211,"Specific antibodies to M. haemolytica, BRSV and PI3V and mean values of IgA, IgG concentrations were significantly higher in the experimental calves compared with the controls."
7212,"However, specific antibody titres to adenovirus type 3, BHV1 and BVDV in the experimental calves had constant levels while the control group levels changed."
7213,"The IgM, Hp and SAA concentrations generally increased until week 8 in the experimental group, but the control group titres became higher after week 9."
7214,This study demonstrates that specific immunisation of cows pre-partum significantly stimulated parameters associated with immunity and it also controlled the acute phase response intensity in their offspring.
7215,Therefore the vaccination of dams may provide additional antibody protection against infection to their offspring.
7216, Immunization of mucosal surfaces has become an attractive route of vaccine delivery because of its ability to induce mucosal immunity.
7217,"Although various methods of inducing mucosal immunity are being developed, our laboratory has focused on developing adenoviruses as replication–competent and replication–incompetent vectors."
7218,The present report will summarize our progress in sequencing the entire bovine adenovirus-3 genome and identifying regions which can be deleted and subsequently used as insertion sites for foreign genes in developing recombinant viral vaccines.
7219,"Using these recombinant viruses, we demonstrated the ‘proof-of-principle’ in developing mucosal immunity and, more importantly, inducing protection against bovine herpes virus in a natural host–cattle."
7220,"Finally, we demonstrated that immunity and protection occurred even in animals that had pre-existing antibodies to the vector."
7221,Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a promising vaccine vector with an excellent safety profile.
7222,"However, despite extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, surprisingly little is known about the cellular tropism of MVA, especially in relevant animal species."
7223,"Here, we performed in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments with recombinant MVA expressing green fluorescent protein (rMVA-GFP)."
7224,"In both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse lung explants, rMVA-GFP predominantly infected antigen presenting cells."
7225,"Subsequent in vivo experiments performed in mice, ferrets and non-human primates indicated that preferential targeting of dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages was observed after respiratory administration, although subtle differences were observed between the respective animal species."
7226,"Following intramuscular injection, rMVA-GFP was detected in interdigitating cells between myocytes, but also in myocytes themselves."
7227,These data are important in advancing our understanding of the basis for the immunogenicity of MVA-based vaccines and aid rational vaccine design and delivery strategies.
7228," The 32nd International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR), sponsored by the International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR), was held in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, on May 12–15, 2019."
7229,This report gives an overview of the conference on behalf of the Society.
7230,"It provides a general review of the meeting and awardees, summarizing the presentations, and their main conclusions from the perspective of researchers active in many different areas of antiviral research and development."
7231,"As in past years, ICAR promoted and showcased the most recent progress in antiviral research, and continued to foster collaborations and interactions in drug discovery and development."
7232,"The 33rd ICAR will be held in Seattle, Washington, USA, March 30th-April 3rd, 2020."
7233,Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries.
7234,Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces.
7235,"Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of β-intimin (L. casei-Int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium."
7236,Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) IgA in feces but no IgG in sera.
7237,"Conversely, anti-Int(cv) IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int(cv)."
7238,All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces.
7239,"However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv) by the sublingual route."
7240,These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection.
7241,"Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge."
7242,Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L.
7243,casei-Int(cv.)
7244,The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.
7245,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the main cause of cold-like illnesses, and currently no vaccine or antiviral therapies against HRVs are available to prevent or mitigate HRV infection."
7246,"There are more than 150 antigenically heterogeneous HRV serotypes, with ∼90 HRVs belonging to major group species A and B."
7247,Development of small animal models that are susceptible to infection with major group HRVs would be beneficial for vaccine research.
7248,"Previously, we showed that the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is semi-permissive to HRV16 (major group, species HRV-A virus) infection, replicating in the upper and lower respiratory tracts with measurable pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators."
7249,"Herein, we report that intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV14 (major group, species HRV-B virus) results in isolation of infectious virus from the nose and lung."
7250,"Similar to HRV16, intramuscular immunization with live HRV14 induces homologous protection that correlated with high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies."
7251,Vaccination and challenge experiments with HRV14 and HRV16 to evaluate the development of cross-protective immunity demonstrate that intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 significantly protects animals against HRV14 challenge.
7252,Determination of the immunological mechanisms involved in heterologous protection and further characterization of infection with other major HRV serotypes in the cotton rat could enhance the robustness of the model to define heterotypic relationships between this diverse group of viruses and thereby increase its potential for development of a multi-serotype HRV vaccine.
7253,Respiratory diseases like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) have been held accountable for major losses for poultry production.
7254,"Nevertheless, scarce information was present dealing with the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of these infections in Greece and the efficacy of currently applied control strategies."
7255,"To fill this gap, a specific epidemiological study was designed."
7256,"A total of 106 broiler and layer farms, including 10 backyard and 96 commercial flocks, were sampled between March 2016 and May 2017, and the obtained tracheal swabs were tested for IBV and aMPV using RT-PCR based techniques followed by sequencing."
7257,"For each farm, data regarding production type, flock features, clinical signs, and vaccination program were also recorded."
7258,"Different associations between vaccination protocol, production type, animal category, birds density, age, presence of clinical signs, and IBV and/or aMPV infection were tested."
7259,"Both IBV and aMPV field strain prevalence were proven high, approximately 20 and 30%, respectively, being the GI-19 lineage (14 out of 19; 73.6%) and B subtype (30 out of 30; 100%), the most commonly detected IBV and aMPV genetic types."
7260,Infection with IBV field strains was significantly associated with clinical sign presence (odds ratio = 8.55 [95CI = 2.17–42.90]).
7261,"Remarkably, only the vaccination protocol involving a double vaccination at 1 D of age was proven protective against IBV-induced symptomatology, with the odds of developing disease being 4.14 [95CI = 1.34–14.51] times lower."
7262,"No association was demonstrated between aMPV infection and clinical outbreaks or between aMPV and IBV detection, suggesting the marginal role of the former pathogen in poultry farming."
7263,"Globally, the present study provides the first detailed investigation of the epidemiological scenario of 2 viruses traditionally considered of pivotal relevance in poultry farming and demonstrates that remarkable benefits could be obtained with just minor adjustments in vaccination protocols."
7264,: A new promising therapeutic approach has emerged for patients chronically infected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the development of a non-replicative adenovirus vector vaccine candidate (Ad-HBV).
7265,"The vaccine encodes a fusion protein composed of a truncated HBV core protein, mutated polymerase protein, and two envelope domains."
7266,"In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of Ad-HBV administered to cynomolgus monkeys during a non-clinical safety assessment."
7267,"METHODS: The virus was subcutaneously administered at 1.0 × 10(9) viral particles (VP)/animal (low-dose group), 1.0 × 10(10) VP/animal (mid-dose group), and 1.0 × 10(11) VP/animal (high-dose group); the control groups were administered an Ad5-null virus (1.0 × 10(11) VP/animal) and saline only."
7268,"RESULTS: Except for inflammatory cell infiltration under the skin at the injection sites and transient elevation of body temperature and serum albumin, no Ad-HBV-related toxic effects were noted in any treatment group."
7269,"Moreover, interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assays showed that Ad-HBV induced the targeting of T cells to a broad spectrum of HBV-specific epitopes spanning all three of the selected HBV immunogens (core, polymerase, and envelope domains) in a dose-dependent manner."
7270,"Although anti-Ad antibody was produced in all groups (except for the saline control), the antibody titers were significantly lower in the high-dose Ad-HBV group than in the group that received the same dose of the Ad-null empty vector."
7271,"In addition, the IFN-γ and IL-2 expression levels in the liver were significantly improved for the mid-dose, high-dose, and Ad-null control group (p < 0.05), but not for the low-dose group."
7272,"CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this safety assessment indicates that the Ad-HBV candidate vaccine is a potent specific immunotherapeutic agent, supporting its further clinical development as an anti-HBV infection vaccine."
7273,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12985-018-1026-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
7274,"Since the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection was reported in 1997, this highly pathogenic virus has infected hundreds of people around the world and resulted in many deaths."
7275,"The ability of H5N1 to cross species boundaries, and the presence of polymorphisms that enhance virulence, present challenges to developing clear strategies to prevent the pandemic spread of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus."
7276,"This review summarizes the current understanding of, and recent research on, the avian influenza H5N1 virus, including transmission, virulence, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention."
7277,"In terms of its highly pathogenic nature, there remains a significant need to further define the immune pathology of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, as well as identify correlates of immunity to help develop vaccines for severe coronaviral infections."
7278,Here we use a SARS-CoV infection-reinfection ferret model and a functional genomics approach to gain insight into SARS immunopathogenesis and to identify correlates of immune protection during SARS-CoV-challenge in ferrets previously infected with SARS-CoV or immunized with a SARS virus vaccine.
7279,We identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of ferrets associated with primary immune responses to SARS-CoV infection and in ferrets that received an identical second inoculum.
7280,Acute SARS-CoV infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by antiviral IFN response gene (IRG) expression.
7281,"Reinfected ferrets, however, lacked the integrated expression of IRGs that was prevalent during acute infection."
7282,"The expression of specific IRGs was also absent upon challenge in ferrets immunized with an inactivated, Al(OH)(3)-adjuvanted whole virus SARS vaccine candidate that protected them against SARS-CoV infection in the lungs."
7283,"Lack of IFN-mediated immune enhancement in infected ferrets that were previously inoculated with, or vaccinated against, SARS-CoV revealed 9 IRG correlates of protective immunity."
7284,This data provides insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoV infections and is an important resource for the development of CoV antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.
7285," Many viruses use the enteric tract as a route of entry to the human, animal or avian host."
7286,"The onset of acute enteritis is associated with infection by viruses that replicate at or near the site of entry into the intestinal mucosa, including caliciviruses, rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses."
7287,These ‘enteric’ viruses occur globally and share similar features.
7288,"Most are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to inflammation and villus atrophy."
7289,Vomiting and diarrhea can result in dehydration and death if untreated.
7290,"Despite abundant growth in vivo, they initially proved difficult or impossible to grow in vitro."
7291,"Most are genetically diverse, species specific, highly infectious within species and transmitted by the fecal-oral route."
7292,"Severe symptoms are most commonly associated with primary infections of young animals, and are followed by short-lived immunity."
7293,"Reinfections are common throughout life, but are often only mildly symptomatic."
7294,Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent severe rotavirus disease in young children.
7295,"In addition to these enterotropic viruses, enteric disease can also result from spread to the intestine of HIV or cytomegaloviruses during the later stages of systemic disease in immunocompromised hosts."
7296,In this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity.
7297,"To illustrate the proof of principle of this novel vaccination strategy, we use the model organism of intracellular immunity Listeria."
7298,"We introduced a, low copy number BAC-plasmid harbouring the virulence gene cluster (vgc) of L. monocytogenes (Lm) into the non-pathogenic L. innocua (L.inn) strain and examined for its ability to induce protective cellular immunity."
7299,The resulting strain (L.inn::vgc) was attenuated for virulence in vivo and showed a strongly reduced host detrimental inflammatory response compared to Lm.
7300,"Like Lm, L.inn::vgc induced the production of Type I Interferon's and protection was mediated by Listeria-specific CD8(+) T cells."
7301,Rational vaccine design whereby avirulent strains are equipped with the capabilities to induce protection but lack detrimental inflammatory effects offer great promise towards future studies using non-pathogenic bacteria as vectors for vaccination.
7302,"Seroepidemiologic and virologic studies since 1889 suggested that human influenza pandemics were caused by H1, H2, and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses."
7303,"If not for the 1997 avian A/H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong of China, subtype H2 is the likely candidate for the next pandemic."
7304,"However, unlike previous poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza due to H5 that were controlled by depopulation with or without vaccination, the presently circulating A/H5N1 genotype Z virus has since been spreading from Southern China to other parts of the world."
7305,"Migratory birds and, less likely, bird trafficking are believed to be globalizing the avian influenza A/H5N1 epidemic in poultry."
7306,"More than 200 human cases of avian influenza virus infection due to A/H5, A/H7, and A/H9 subtypes mainly as a result of poultry-to-human transmission have been reported with a > 50% case fatality rate for A/H5N1 infections."
7307,A mutant or reassortant virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could trigger another influenza pandemic.
7308,The recent isolation of this virus in extrapulmonary sites of human diseases suggests that the high fatality of this infection may be more than just the result of a cytokine storm triggered by the pulmonary disease.
7309,The emergence of resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and recently oseltamivir while H5N1 vaccines are still at the developmental stage of phase I clinical trial are causes for grave concern.
7310,"Moreover, the to-be pandemic strain may have little cross immunogenicity to the presently tested vaccine strain."
7311,"The relative importance and usefulness of airborne, droplet, or contact precautions in infection control are still uncertain."
7312,"Laboratory-acquired avian influenza H7N7 has been reported, and the laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2 could also be the cause of another pandemic."
7313,The control of this impending disaster requires more research in addition to national and international preparedness at various levels.
7314,"The epidemiology, virology, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, management, and hospital infection control measures are reviewed from a clinical perspective."
7315,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus caused a severe outbreak in several regions of the world in 2003.
7316,"The virus is a novel coronavirus, which may have an origin in wild animals such as civet cats in southern China."
7317,"Its genome structure, gene expression pattern and protein profiles are similar to those of other coronaviruses."
7318,"However, distinct patterns of several open reading frames in the SARS virus genome may contribute to its severe virulence."
7319,The potential mutability of the coronavirus genome may pose problems in the control of future SARS outbreaks.
7320,The mechanism of SARS pathogenesis may involve both direct viral cytocidal effects on the target cells and immune-mediated mechanisms.
7321,"The life cycle of the SARS virus is largely unknown; however, based on the analogy with other coronaviruses, several potential targets for antiviral development are identified."
7322,"Vaccines offer an important preventive measure for possible future recurrences of SARS, but the prospect for their development is still unknown because of the uncertainty regarding the role of immune responses in SARS virus pathogenesis."
7323,The comparative studies of other coronaviruses offer insights into the understanding of SARS virus.
7324,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects."
7325,"ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented."
7326,"Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis and sperm."
7327,"Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials."
7328,"Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV."
7329,These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.
7330,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sentinel receptors of the host innate immune system that recognize conserved ‘pathogen-associated molecular patterns’ of invading microbes, including viruses."
7331,The activation of TLRs establishes antiviral innate immune responses and coordinates the development of long-lasting adaptive immunity in order to control viral pathogenesis.
7332,"However, microbe-induced damage to host tissues may release ‘danger-associated molecular patterns’ that also activate TLRs, leading to an overexuberant inflammatory response and, ultimately, to tissue damage."
7333,"Thus, TLRs have proven to be promising targets as therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections that result in inflammatory damage or as adjuvants in order to enhance the efficacy of vaccines."
7334,"Here, we explore recent advances in TLR biology with a focus on novel drugs that target TLRs (agonists and antagonists) for antiviral therapy."
7335," Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has continued spreading since its emergence in 2012 with a mortality rate of 35.6%, and is a potential pandemic threat."
7336,Prophylactics and therapies are urgently needed to address this public health problem.
7337,We report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV.
7338,"In this study, a fusion of the canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV can self-assemble into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP)."
7339,"sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions."
7340,Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.
7341,"sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320."
7342,"IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot."
7343,"Furthermore, mice inoculated with sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity."
7344,Our study demonstrates that sVLP displaying the RBD of MERS-CoV are promising prophylactic candidates against MERS-CoV in a potential outbreak situation.
7345,Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PDEV) can cause severe diarrhea in pigs.
7346,Development of effective vaccines against TGEV and PEDV is one of important prevention measures.
7347,"The spike (S) protein is the surface glycoprotein of TGEV and PEDV, which can induce specific neutralization antibodies and is a candidate antigen for vaccination attempts."
7348,"In this study, the open reading frames of the TGEV S1 protein and in addition of the S or S1 proteins of PEDV were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector, pIRES, resulting in recombinant plasmids, pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S)."
7349,"Subsequently, 6–8 weeks old Kunming mice were inoculated with both DNA plasmids."
7350,"Lymphocyte proliferation assay, virus neutralization assay, IFN-γ assay and CTL activity assay were performed."
7351,TGEV/PEDV specific antibody responses as well as kinetic changes of T lymphocyte subgroups of the immunized mice were analyzed.
7352,The results showed that the recombinant DNA plasmids increased the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subgroups.
7353,"In addition, the DNA vaccines induced a high level of IFN-γ in the immunized mice."
7354,The specific CTL activity in the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group became significant at 42 days post-immunization.
7355,"At 35 days post-immunization, the recombinant DNA plasmids bearing full-length S genes of TGEV and PEDV stimulated higher levels of specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice."
7356,Recent advancements in biotechnology have enabled the rapid identification and subsequent expression of pathogenic microbial major antigens that induce protective immune responses.
7357,"However, subunit vaccines have not been successfully commercialized mainly due to the lack of sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAs)."
7358,High levels of NA rely on the efficient recognition and cross-linking of multiple neutralizing epitopes with B-cell receptors (BCRs).
7359,Nanoparticles are able to display coupled antigenic arrays at high density and provide multiple binding molecular scenarios with BCRs.
7360,The high-resolution antigenic structure makes it possible to accurately display stable neutralizing epitopes.
7361,"Therefore, the development of a nanovaccine that orientationally displays neutralizing epitopes is a feasible strategy."
7362,"To address this hypothesis, the capsid (Cap) protein of porcine circovirus type 2 as model antigen was conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through direct reaction of the mercapto group of the unique cysteines with AuNPs, rendering Cap-AuNPs to have neutralizing epitopes on outer surface and an immunodominant epitope buried within the inner surface."
7363,"In vitro studies showed that AuNPs promoted the phagocytosis of Cap protein and NA levels were significantly improved, meanwhile antibody levels against the immunodominant epitope was significantly reduced."
7364,"In mouse studies, Cap-AuNP-immunized mice displayed a high production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and interferon-γ, suggesting that Cap-AuNPs can effectively activate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and balance Th1 and Th2 cellular responses."
7365,"This study presents a new vaccine design strategy based on antigen structure, where nanoparticles are coupled to antigens in well-ordered arrays and orientationally display neutralizing epitopes to enhance NA levels."
7366,The respiratory system consists of an integrated network of organs and structures that primarily function for gas exchange.
7367,"In mammals, oxygen and carbon dioxide are transmitted through a complex respiratory tract, consisting of the nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, and lung."
7368,Exposure to ambient air throughout the lifespan imposes vulnerability of the respiratory system to environmental challenges that can contribute toward development of disease.
7369,"The importance of the respiratory system to human health is supported by statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; in 2015, chronic lower respiratory diseases were the third leading cause of death in the United States."
7370,"In light of the significant mortality associated with respiratory conditions that afflict all ages of the human population, this review will focus on basic and preclinical research conducted in nonhuman primate models of respiratory disease."
7371,"In comparison with other laboratory animals, the nonhuman primate lung most closely resembles the human lung in structure, physiology, and mucosal immune mechanisms."
7372,"Studies defining the influence of inhaled microbes, pollutants, or allergens on the nonhuman primate lung have provided insight on disease pathogenesis, with the potential for elucidation of molecular targets leading to new treatment modalities."
7373,Vaccine trials in nonhuman primates have been crucial for confirmation of safety and protective efficacy against infectious diseases of the lung in a laboratory animal model that recapitulates pathology observed in humans.
7374,"In looking to the future, nonhuman primate models of respiratory diseases will continue to be instrumental for translating biomedical research for improvement of human health."
7375,"In November 2018, yellow fever was diagnosed in a Dutch traveller returning from a bicycle tour in the Gambia-Senegal region."
7376,"A complete genome sequence of yellow fever virus (YFV) from the case was generated and clustered phylogenetically with YFV from the Gambia and Senegal, ruling out importation into the Netherlands from recent outbreaks in Brazil or Angola."
7377,We emphasise the need for increased public awareness of YFV vaccination before travelling to endemic countries.
7378,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was characterized by increased pathogenicity in the elderly due to an early exacerbated innate host response.
7379,SARS-CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that entered the human population through an intermediate host like the palm civet.
7380,"To prevent future introductions of zoonotic SARS-CoV strains and subsequent transmission into the human population, heterologous disease models are needed to test the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics against both late human and zoonotic isolates."
7381,Here we show that both human and zoonotic SARS-CoV strains can infect cynomolgus macaques and resulted in radiological as well as histopathological changes similar to those seen in mild human cases.
7382,Viral replication was higher in animals infected with a late human phase isolate compared to a zoonotic isolate.
7383,"While there were significant differences in the number of host genes differentially regulated during the host responses between the three SARS-CoV strains, the top pathways and functions were similar and only apparent early during infection with the majority of genes associated with interferon signaling pathways."
7384,This study characterizes critical disease models in the evaluation and licensure of therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV for human use.
7385,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease, and an effective vaccine is not available."
7386,"In this study, we compared the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of recombinant proteins corresponding to different domains of the SARS-coronavirus spike protein."
7387,Trimeric recombinant proteins were created by fusing the foldon domain derived from T4 bacteriophage to the carboxy-termini of individual domains of the spike protein.
7388,"While the full-length ectodomain (S) of the spike protein, the full-length ectodomain fused to foldon (S-foldon), the S1 domain (S1), S1-foldon, and the S2 domain(S2) antigens all elicited comparable antibody titers as measured by ELISA, S-foldon induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibody and S2 protein did not elicit virus neutralizing antibodies."
7389,"When tested in a mouse virus replication model, all the mice vaccinated with the S1, S1-foldon, S, or S-foldon were completely protected."
7390, The human olfactory system is a mucosal surface and a major portal of entry for respiratory and neurotropic pathogens into the body.
7391,Understanding how the human nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) halts the progression of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract or the central nervous system is key for developing effective cures.
7392,"Although traditionally mice have been used as the gold-standard model for the study of human nasal diseases, mouse models present important caveats due to major anatomical and functional differences of the human and murine olfactory system and NALT."
7393,We summarize the NALT anatomy of different animal groups that have thus far been used to study host-pathogen interactions at the olfactory mucosa and to test nasal vaccines.
7394,The goal of this review is to highlight the strengths and limitations of each animal model of nasal immunity and to identify the areas of research that require further investigation to advance human health.
7395,"Arboviruses are arthropod-borne viruses that exhibit worldwide distribution and are a constant threat, not only for public health but also for wildlife, domestic animals, and even plants."
7396,"To study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies, the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern."
7397,Adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon α/β (IFN-α/β) receptor (IFNAR(−/−)) have been described as a model of arbovirus infections.
7398,"Studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues, and in some cases, the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals."
7399,"Moreover, the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance."
7400,Recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections.
7401,A tremendous advantage of the IFNAR(−/−) mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus.
7402,"Although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans, experimental infections of IFNAR(−/−) mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host."
7403,"Therefore, IFNAR(−/−) mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and the protective efficacy of new vaccines."
7404,"In this review article, the most important arboviruses that have been studied using the IFNAR(−/−) mouse model will be reviewed."
7405,Naturally occurring strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials for oncolytic cancer therapy in the United States and abroad.
7406,"We have previously reported, for the first time, the development of recombinant NDVs designed for enhanced cancer therapeutic efficacy."
7407,"Specifically, we have shown that NDV engineered to express interleukin-2 (IL-2) generates a robust therapeutic response associated with increased tumor-specific T-cell infiltration after intratumoral administration in mice."
7408,We have now demonstrated that this therapeutic response is dependent on T cells and we have investigated the potential to focus the NDV-induced immune response toward a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) to enhance the inherent therapeutic efficacy of NDV further.
7409,"We found that intratumoral treatments of tumor-bearing mice with recombinant NDV expressing a model TAA elicited an enhanced tumor-specific response, resulting in a significant increase in the number of complete tumor regressions compared with control NDV."
7410,"Additionally, coadministration of NDV expressing a model TAA with NDV expressing IL-2 enhanced the TAA-directed response and led to more complete tumor regressions."
7411,Our results show that TAA-directed immunotherapy by oncolytic recombinant NDV alone or in combination with IL-2 results in an enhanced therapeutic efficacy and warrant consideration in the development of cancer therapies based on the use of oncolytic NDV.
7412,: There is a clear need for vaccines and therapeutics for potential biological weapons of mass destruction and emerging diseases.
7413,"Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, has been used as both a biological warfare agent and bioterrorist weapon previously."
7414,"Although antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of anthrax infection, it does not have any effect once exposed individuals become symptomatic due to B. anthracis exotoxin accumulation."
7415,The bipartite exotoxins are the major contributing factors to the morbidity and mortality observed in acute anthrax infections.
7416,"METHODS: Using recombinant B. anthracis protective antigen (PA83), covalently coupled to a novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide (NT-MDP) derivative we hyper-immunized goats three times over the course of 14 weeks."
7417,Goats were plasmapheresed and the IgG fraction (not affinity purified) and F(ab')(2 )derivatives were characterized in vitro and in vivo for protection against lethal toxin mediated intoxication.
7418,RESULTS: Anti-PA83 IgG conferred 100% protection at 7.5 μg in a cell toxin neutralization assay.
7419,Mice exposed to 5 LD(50 )of Bacillus anthracis Ames spores by intranares inoculation demonstrated 60% survival 14 d post-infection when administered a single bolus dose (32 mg/kg body weight) of anti-PA83 IgG at 24 h post spore challenge.
7420,Anti-PA83 F(ab')(2 )fragments retained similar neutralization and protection levels both in vitro and in vivo.
7421,"CONCLUSION: The protection afforded by these GMP-grade caprine immunotherapeutics post-exposure in the pilot murine model suggests they could be used effectively to treat post-exposure, symptomatic human anthrax patients following a bioterrorism event."
7422,These results also indicate that recombinant PA83 coupled to NT-MDP is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies and suggest it would be a promising vaccine candidate for anthrax.
7423,"The ease of production, ease of covalent attachment, and immunostimulatory activity of the NT-MDP indicate it would be a superior adjuvant to alum or other traditional adjuvants in vaccine formulations."
7424,We established a cold-adapted infectious bronchitis virus (BP-caKII) by passaging a field virus through specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs 20 times at 32 °C.
7425,"We characterized its growth kinetics and pathogenicity in embryonated eggs, and its tropism and persistence in different tissues from chickens; then, we evaluated pathogenicity by using a new premature reproductive tract pathogenicity model."
7426,"Furthermore, we determined the complete genomic sequence of BP-caKII to understand the genetic changes related to cold adaptation."
7427,"According to our results, BP-caKII clustered with the KII genotype viruses K2 and KM91, and showed less pathogenicity than K2, a live attenuated vaccine strain."
7428,"BP-caKII showed delayed viremia, resulting in its delayed dissemination to the kidneys and cecal tonsils compared to K2 and KM91, the latter of which is a pathogenic field strain."
7429,"A comparative genomics study revealed similar nucleotide sequences between BP-caKII, K2 and KM91 but clearly showed different mutations among them."
7430,"BP-caKII shared several mutations with K2 (nsp13, 14, 15 and 16) following embryo adaptation but acquired multiple additional mutations in nonstructural proteins (nsp3, 4 and 12), spike proteins and nucleocapsid proteins following cold adaptation."
7431,"Thus, the establishment of BP-caKII and the identified mutations in this study may provide insight into the genetic background of embryo and cold adaptations, and the attenuation of coronaviruses."
7432,Relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis an autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis
7433,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is prevalent in most parts of the world.
7434,"Owing to its antigenic variation, prevention of the diseases caused by this virus is difficult."
7435,"In this study, two PEDV isolates with similar growth kinetics were successfully propagated in Vero cells."
7436,"Complete genome sequence analysis showed that they have a 49nt deletion in the ORF3 gene and were classified into Group 1, the same group that includes the classical CV777 strain."
7437,"Recombination analysis revealed that the event had occurred in the ORF1a gene, at 3596–6819 nt, among the two PEDV isolates and the CV777 and DR13 strains."
7438,"During their continuous propagation, 14 nonsynonymous mutations occurred in the spike (S) gene of strain JS-2/2014 between generations G5 and G90, but there were no changes between G90 and G100."
7439,We assumed that strain JS-2/2014 might be attenuated by the 90th generation.
7440,"Piglets orally fed with JS-2/2014 G90 showed no clinical symptoms, and no virus was detected in the feces and nasal fluid."
7441,"In conclusion, JS-2/2014 was successfully identified by screening, was attenuated after propagation in Vero cells, and may serve as a candidate virus for vaccine preparations."
7442," Orthopoxviruses code for numerous immunomodulatory proteins, the structure and function of which are clarified inadequately."
7443,"Antibodies constitute a potent tool to study such proteins, enabling conclusions on protein location and time course of expression."
7444,"However, common antibody production in mice or rabbits requires tedious protein expression and injection, as well as blood collection at regular intervals."
7445,"To simplify this procedure, IgY antibodies specific for poxviral proteins (F1L and p28) were generated by immunisation of chickens, because antibody retrieval from eggs allows the non-invasive generation of huge amounts of antibodies."
7446,"The main intentions were (i) to decrease invasiveness, (ii) to immunise with native forms of proteins and (iii) to circumvent previous protein expression and purification."
7447,"Therefore, chicken were immunised with DNA expression vectors coding for conserved domains of the selected proteins delivered for the first time by a gene gun."
7448,Four weeks after initial immunisation specific antibodies were found in the egg yolk as proven by immunofluorescence staining of poxvirus-infected cells.
7449,"The specific IgY titre rose to 1:80,000 and was stable for more than 120 days."
7450,With this investigation we present an universal procedure for IgY design and production that can be applied for various issues in the future.
7451, Providing protective immunity to neonatal animals in early life is associated with numerous challenges regarding vaccine safety and efficacy.
7452,"A much simpler approach is maternal vaccination, either before or during pregnancy, to provide the neonate with passively transferred immunity."
7453,"In humans, the medical, societal and legal risks of immunizing pregnant women are important considerations in undertaking this approach."
7454,"By contrast, maternal vaccination has been successfully employed in the animal health industry for decades."
7455,These veterinary vaccines have proven to be safe and efficient.
7456,"Although only passively transferred antibodies have been extensively studied, other immunological mechanisms may be equally important in providing maternally derived immunity."
7457,"In our globalised, fast-changing world (deforestation, fast-growing animal protein demand, etc."
7458,"), animal diseases that have an impact on public health, livelihoods, food security as well as the international trade of products of animal origin are constantly emerging or re-emerging."
7459,"The complexity of disease emergencies calls for the identification of often collaborative effective strategies, based on both science and proven practical experience, to reduce future threats."
7460,"The H(5)N(1) avian influenza crisis has shown how crucial it is to address persistent global threats at the interface between humans, animals and ecosystems which requires (i) to strengthen animal and human health institutions and (ii) build strong partnerships among players who may have different perspectives on some issues and different levels of resources."
7461,"To address the gaps in the animal health sector, OIE seeks to build member countries’ capacities in policy design and good governance in animal health systems and Veterinary Services."
7462,"At policy level, the OIE helps its members to enhance their credibility, both at the national and international level, by providing them with efficient tools, such as the strategic planning tools of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, with the objective to attract more commitment and more resources from their decision makers and partners."
7463,"At good governance level, it provides science-based guidance that supports members in detecting, preventing and managing serious animal disease outbreaks through improved surveillance systems, strengthened laboratory networks and improved legislation."
7464,"OIE promotes strong partnerships, notably with FAO and WHO, especially with regard to two topics that are getting currently a great attention and that require a strong multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels because of their social, economical and ecological determinants: rabies in humans that still kills more than 50,000 persons every year, mainly in Asia and mostly youngsters, and that is believed to be totally preventable through effective dog vaccination, and antimicrobial resistance that can hinder the effective treatment and recovery of illnesses in both humans and animals."
7465,"At regional level and in full collaboration with ASEAN and other partners, the OIE Sub-Regional Representation (OIESRR) for Southeast Asia plays a significant role in regional coordination of animal health and emerging infectious disease management in a region that is often considered as a ‘hotspot’ for emergence."
7466,"Along the strategic objectives of the OIE Fifth Strategic Plan, the implementation of its activities to achieve the OIE Strategic Objectives is supported by various programmes and projects funded by donors."
7467,"Its long-standing flagship regional programme, the Southeast Asia and China Foot-and-Mouth Disease (SEACFMD) Campaign which aims at controlling FMD by 2020 through vaccination promotes socio-economical and participatory approaches as well as assessment of the role of wildlife."
7468, Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is a disease of foals caused by the obligate intracellular organism Lawsonia intracellularis.
7469,"This organism is unique in that it causes proliferation of infected enterocytes, resulting in thickening of the intestinal epithelium, most often the small intestine."
7470,"This disease affects mainly weanling foals and causes fever, lethargy, peripheral edema, diarrhea, colic and weight loss."
7471,"The diagnosis of EPE may be challenging and relies on the presence of hypoproteinemia, thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall observed on abdominal ultrasonography, positive serology and molecular detection of L. intracellularis in feces."
7472,The epidemiology and genetic basis for pathogenesis for this disease is beginning to be elucidated.
7473,"Phenotypic traits, genomic features, and gene expression profiles during L. intracellularis infection in vitro and in vivo are presented."
7474,"In addition, this article reviews the epidemiology, pathological and clinicopathological findings, diagnosis, and control of EPE."
7475, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an avian virus that is attenuated in primates and is a potential vaccine vector for human use.
7476,We evaluated NDV as a vector for expressing selected antigens of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi.
7477,"A series of recombinant NDVs were generated that expressed intracellular or extracellular forms of two B. burgdorferi antigens: namely, the basic membrane protein A (BmpA) and the outer surface protein C (OspC)."
7478,Expression of the intracellular and extracellular forms of these antigens was confirmed in cultured chicken cells.
7479,"C3H or Balb/C mice that were immunized intranasally with the NDV vectors mounted vigorous serum antibody responses against the NDV vector, but failed to mount a robust response against either the intracellular or extracellular forms of BmpA or OspC."
7480,"By contrast, a single immunization of hamsters with the NDV vectors via the intranasal, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal route resulted in rapid and rigorous antibody responses against the intracellular or extracellular forms of BmpA and OspC."
7481,"When groups of hamsters were separately inoculated with various NDV vectors and challenged with B. burgdorferi (108 cells/animal), immunization with vector expressing either intracellular or extracellular BmpA was associated with a significant reduction of the pathogen load in the joints."
7482,"Taken together, our studies highlighted the importance of NDV as vaccine vector that can be used for simple yet effective immunization of hosts against bacterial infections including Lyme disease."
7483,Influenza is a perennial problem affecting millions of people annually with the everpresent threat of devastating pandemics.
7484,Active prophylaxis by vaccination against influenza virus is currently the main countermeasure supplemented with antivirals.
7485,"However, disadvantages of this strategy include the impact of antigenic drift, necessitating constant updating of vaccine strain composition, and emerging antiviral drug resistance."
7486,"The development of other options for influenza prophylaxis, particularly with broad acting agents able to provide protection in the period between the onset of a pandemic and the development of a strain specific vaccine, is of great interest."
7487,Exploitation of broad-spectrum mediators could provide barricade protection in the early critical phase of influenza virus outbreaks.
7488,"Passive immunity has the potential to provide immediate antiviral effects, inhibiting virus replication, reducing virus shedding, and thereby protecting vulnerable populations in the event of an impending influenza pandemic."
7489,"Here, we review passive broad-spectrum influenza prophylaxis options with a focus on harnessing natural host defenses, including interferons and antibodies."
7490,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)."
7491,The SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is composed of two subunits; the S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that engages with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the S2 subunit mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes.
7492,"The S protein plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity, during infection with SARS-CoV."
7493,"In this Review, we highlight recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on the S protein."
7494,Studies on Influenza Virus Transmission between Ferrets: the Public Health Risks Revisited
7495,Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) serotypes 1–9 are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds worldwide.
7496,"APMV-1 (also called Newcastle disease virus, NDV) is attenuated in non-human primates and is being developed as a candidate human vaccine vector."
7497,The vector potential of the other serotypes was unknown.
7498,"In the present study, we evaluated nine different biologically- or recombinantly-derived APMV strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model."
7499,"Five of the viruses were: biologically-derived wild type (wt) APMV-2, -3, -5, -7 and -9."
7500,Another virus was a recombinant (r) version of wt APMV-4.
7501,"The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic."
7502,"Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion."
7503,Virus shedding was not detected for wt APMV-5.
7504,"Very limited shedding was detected for wt rAPMV-4 and modified rAPMV-4, and only in a subset of animals."
7505,"Shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal, and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract."
7506,"In particular, shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rAPMV-2, wt APMV-7, and modified rAPMV-7."
7507,Modification of the F protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rAPMV-2 and marginally by wt rAPMV-4.
7508,All APMVs except wt APMV-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals.
7509,None of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs.
7510,"These results indicate that APMVs 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates, but are moderately-to-highly restricted, depending on the serotype."
7511,"This suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature, and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development."
7512,A safe and effective vaccine adjuvant is important in modern vaccines.
7513,Various Chinese herbal polysaccharides can activate the immune system.
7514,Cistanche deserticola (CD) is a traditional Chinese herb and an adjuvant candidate.
7515,"Here, we confirmed that water-extractable polysaccharides of CD (WPCD) could modulate immune responses in vitro and in vivo."
7516,"In a dose-dependent manner, WPCD significantly promoted the maturation and function of murine marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) through up-regulating the expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40, allogenic T cell proliferation, and the yields of IL-12 and TNF-α via toll-like receptor4 (TLR4), as indicated by in vitro experiments."
7517,"In addition, its immunomodulatory activity was also observed in mice."
7518,"WPCD effectively improved the titers of IgG, IgG(1) and IgG(2a) and markedly enhanced the proliferation of T and B cells, the production of IFN-γ and IL-4 in CD4(+) T cells and the expression level of IFN-γ in CD8(+) T cells better than Alum."
7519,"Furthermore, WPCD could markedly up-regulate the expression levels of CD40 and CD80 on DCs in spleen and down-regulate the Treg frequency."
7520,The study suggests that polysaccharides of Cistanche deserticola are a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant for eliciting both humoral immunity and cellular immunity by activating DCs via TLR4 signaling pathway.
7521,"Using the Taiwan nationwide laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) database, we analyzed neutralizing antibody in relation to clinical outcomes."
7522,"With a linear mixed model, neutralizing antibody titer was shown to peak between week 5 and week 8 after onset and to decline thereafter, with a half-life of 6.4 weeks."
7523,Patients with a longer illness showed a lower neutralizing antibody response than patients with a shorter illness duration (p = 0.008).
7524,"When early responders were compared with most patients, who seroconverted on and after week 3 of illness, the small proportion (17.4%) of early responders (antibody detectable within 2 weeks) had a higher death rate (29.6% vs. 7.8%) (Fisher exact test, p = 0.004), had a shorter survival time of <2 weeks (Fisher exact test, p = 0.013), and were more likely to be > 60 years of age (Fisher exact test, p = 0.01)."
7525,Our findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS and for SARS vaccine research and development.
7526,This review summarizes recent experimental achievements in the area of the development of new RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics for the treatment of viral respiratory diseases.
7527,Delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to their intended target tissue remains the biggest problem for most therapeutic applications of these compounds.
7528,Appropriate formulations and chemical modifications for improved stability will boost the probability of utilization of RNAi drugs in the clinical applications.
7529,Section editor: Charles Craig – Clinical Virology Specialist
7530,The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) poses a great threat to the global swine industries and the unreliable protection induced by the currently available vaccines remains a major challenge.
7531,"We previously generated a genogroup 2b (G2b) PEDV Taiwan Pintung 52 (PEDVPT) strain, PEDVPT-P96, and determined its promising host immune response against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 strain."
7532,"To study the attenuation determinants of PEDVPT-P96 and establish a PEDVPT-P96-based recombinant vector as a vaccine platform for further antigenicity modification, iPEDVPT-P96, a full-length cDNA clone of PEDVPT-P96, was established."
7533,"Comparing to the parental PEDVPT-P96 virus, the iPEDVPT-P96 virus showed efficient replication kinetics with a delayed decline of viral load and similar but much more uniform plaque sizes in Vero cells."
7534,"In the 5-week-old piglet model, fecal viral shedding was observed in the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated piglets, whereas those inoculated with iPEDVPT-P96 showed neither detectable fecal viral shedding nor PEDV-associated clinical signs."
7535,"Moreover, inoculation with iPEDVPT-P96 elicited comparable levels of anti-PEDV specific plasma IgG and fecal/salivary IgA, neutralizing antibody titers, and similar but less effective immunoprotection against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge compared to the parental PEDVPT-P96."
7536,"In the present study, an infectious cDNA clone of an attenuated G2b PEDV strain was successfully generated for the first time, and the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that iPEDVPT-P96 is further attenuated but remains immunogenic compared to its parental PEDVPT-P96 viral stock."
7537,The successful development of the iPEDVPT-P96 cDNA clone could allow for the manipulation of the viral genome to study viral pathogenesis and facilitate the rapid development of effective vaccines.
7538,Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
7539,"The continuous increase of MERS cases has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide, calling for development of safe and effective MERS vaccines."
7540,We have previously shown that a recombinant protein containing residues 377–588 of MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) fused with human Fc (S377-588-Fc) induced highly potent anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in the presence of MF59 adjuvant.
7541,Here we optimized the doses of S377-588-Fc using MF59 as an adjuvant in order to elicit strong immune responses with minimal amount of antigen.
7542,Our results showed that S377-588-Fc at 1 μg was able to induce in the immunized mice potent humoral and cellular immune responses.
7543,"Particularly, S377-588-Fc at 1 μg elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV similar to those induced at 5 and 20 μg, respectively."
7544,"These results suggest that this RBD-based subunit MERS vaccine candidate at the dose as low as one μg is sufficiently potent to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, against MERS-CoV infection, thus providing guidance for determining the optimal dosage of RBD-based MERS vaccines in the future clinical trials and for applying the dose-sparing strategy in other subunit vaccine trials."
7545," Three miscellaneous positive-strand RNA viruses are described briefly with an emphasis on the genome structure: caliciviruses, togaviruses, and coronaviruses."
7546,"Unlike those described in the two preceding chapters, these RNA viruses possess one or more subgenomic RNAs, besides the full-length genomic RNA."
7547,These subgenomic RNAs are all positioned to the 3′ side of the RNA genome and encode structural proteins.
7548,"Importantly, viruses belonging to these three RNA virus families have become a global public health concern."
7549,"Noroviruses, a prototype of calicivirus, are responsible for almost all viral gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide."
7550,"Moreover, some newly emerging viruses belong to togaviruses and coronaviruses."
7551,"Chikungunya virus, an emerging virus that caused an outbreak in Africa during 2004–2006, belongs to the togavirus family."
7552,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which caused 2003 SARS outbreak in China and 2014 MERS outbreak in the Middle East, belong to the coronavirus family."
7553,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available."
7554,"Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy."
7555,Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others.
7556,"Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS."
7557,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel betacoronavirus (MERS coronavirus, MERS-CoV)."
7558,"Since its first emergence in 2012, multiple transmission events of MERS-CoV (dromedary to human and human to human) have been reported, indicating that MERS-CoV has the potential to cause widespread outbreak."
7559,"However, the epidemiology of MERS as well as immune responses against the virus in animal models and patients are still not well understood, hindering the vaccine and therapeutic developments."
7560,"In this review, we summarize recent genetic and epidemic findings of MERS-CoV and the progress in animal model development, immune response studies in both animals and humans."
7561,"At last, we discussed the breakthrough on vaccine and therapeutic development which are important against potential future MERS outbreak."
7562, The development of antiviral strategies to treat or prevent norovirus infections is a pressing matter.
7563,"Noroviruses are the number 1 cause of acute gastroenteritis, of foodborne illness, of sporadic gastroenteritis in all age groups and of severe acute gastroenteritis in children less than 5 years old seeking medical assistance [USA/CDC]."
7564,"In developing countries, noroviruses are linked to significant mortality (∼200000 children <5 years old)."
7565,"Noroviruses are a major culprit for the closure of hospital wards, and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality among the elderly."
7566,Transplant patients have significant risk of acquiring persistent norovirus gastroenteritis.
7567,"Control and prevention strategies are limited to the use of disinfectants and hand sanitizers, whose efficacy is frequently insufficient."
7568,"Hence, there is an ample need for antiviral treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infections."
7569,The fact that only a handful of inhibitors of norovirus replication have been reported can largely be attributable to the hampering inability to cultivate human noroviruses in cell culture.
7570,The Norwalk replicon-bearing cells and the murine norovirus-infected cell lines are the available models to assess in vitro antiviral activity of compounds.
7571,"Human noroviruses have been shown to replicate (to some extent) in mice, calves, gnotobiotic pigs, and chimpanzees."
7572,Infection of interferon-deficient mice with the murine norovirus results in virus-induced diarrhea.
7573,Here we review recent developments in understanding which norovirus proteins or host cell factors may serve as targets for inhibition of viral replication.
7574,"Given the recent advances, significant progress in the search for antiviral strategies against norovirus infections is expected in the upcoming years."
7575,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a widely distributed hemorrhagic fever virus and the cause of hemorrhagic disease in Africa, Southern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and Asia."
7576,Recent emergence of CCHFV into Spain indicates that the geographic range of this virus is expanding and the presence of its tick vector in several countries without reported disease suggest that CCHFV will continue to spread.
7577,Research into CCHFV was historically limited by a lack of suitable animal models and tools to study viral pathogenesis.
7578,"However, in the past few years the toolset for studying CCHFV has expanded with small animal and non-human primate models for CCHFV being developed along with a reverse genetics system that allows for investigation of viral determinants of disease."
7579,These tools have been utilized to understand how CCHFV antagonizes host restriction factors and to develop novel vaccine candidates that may help limit the substantial morbidity and mortality in humans caused by CCHFV.
7580,: A33 is a type II integral membrane protein expressed on the extracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus (VACV).
7581,Passive transfer of A33-directed monoclonal antibodies or vaccination with an A33 subunit vaccine confers protection against lethal poxvirus challenge in animal models.
7582,Homologs of A33 are highly conserved among members of the Orthopoxvirus genus and are potential candidates for inclusion in vaccines or assays targeting extracellular enveloped virus activity.
7583,"One monoclonal antibody directed against VACV A33, MAb-1G10, has been shown to target a conformation-dependent epitope."
7584,"Interestingly, while it recognizes VACV A33 as well as the corresponding variola homolog, it does not bind to the monkeypox homolog."
7585,"In this study, we utilized a random phage display library to investigate the epitope recognized by MAb-1G10 that is critical for facilitating cell-to-cell spread of the vaccinia virus."
7586,"RESULTS: By screening with linear or conformational random phage libraries, we found that phages binding to MAb-1G10 display the consensus motif CEPLC, with a disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues required for MAb-1G10 binding."
7587,"Although the phage motif contained no linear sequences homologous to VACV A33, structure modeling and analysis suggested that residue D115 is important to form the minimal epitope core."
7588,A panel of point mutants expressing the ectodomain of A33 protein was generated and analyzed by either binding assays such as ELISA and immunoprecipitation or a functional assessment by blocking MAb-1G10 mediated comet inhibition in cell culture.
7589,"CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm L118 as a component of the MAb-1G10 binding epitope, and further identify D115 as an essential residue."
7590,"By defining the minimum conformational structure, as well as the conformational arrangement of a short peptide sequence recognized by MAb-1G10, these results introduce the possibility of designing small molecule mimetics that may interfere with the function of A33 in vivo."
7591,This information will also be useful for designing improved assays to evaluate the potency of monoclonal and polyclonal products that target A33 or A33-modulated EV dissemination.
7592,"The first major pandemic of the new millennium that arose from southern China in 2002 was of zoonotic origin from wild game animals, called severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]."
7593,The culprit was determined to be a coronavirus of animal origin [SARS-CoV].
7594,"The discovery of the SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of >8000 people in >30 countries with fatality of about 10%, resulted in intense search for novel coronaviruses with potentially high pathogenicity."
7595,"Ten years later after the SARS pandemic, another novel coronavirus crossed the species barrier from bats to humans through an intermediate camel host, to produce a severe lower respiratory infection labeled the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]."
7596,"A novel coronavirus [MERS-CoV] was first identified in September 2012, from patients who resided or traveled to Saudi Arabia."
7597,The MERS-CoV spread through contacts with camel and subsequently from human to human via droplet transmission.
7598,"MERS cases occurred in several other countries including in Europe and the United States, mainly from residence or travel to the Arabian Peninsula, but was not of pandemic potential."
7599,"However, in the spring of 2015, a MERS outbreak started in South Korea which was initiated by a returning traveler from Saudi Arabia, and subsequently secondary infection of over 186 local residents occurred."
7600,Recent estimate in May 2015 indicates that the MERS-CoV have afflicted 1167 patients with MERS worldwide with 479 deaths [41% fatality].
7601,Thus MERS is more deadly than SARS but appears to be less contagious.
7602,"However, unlike SARS which has not reappeared since 2002–2003, MERS-CoV have the potential to cause sporadic or local outbreaks for many years as the virus may now be entrenched endemically in dromedary camels of the Middle East."
7603,Mucosal immunisation and immunoprophylaxis as potential strategies for prevention of SARS
7604,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy."
7605,"CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales."
7606,All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs.
7607,"CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans."
7608,"CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection."
7609,"Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease."
7610,"The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently."
7611,SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate.
7612,The SARS-CoV outbreak was controlled by public health measures alone.
7613,"However, emergence or re-emergence of CoV from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health."
7614,The cytotoxicity of epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells is usually measured indirectly through IFNγ production.
7615,Existing assays that directly measure this activity are limited mainly to measurements of up to two specificities in a single reaction.
7616,"Here, we develop a multiplex cytotoxicity assay that allows direct, simultaneous measurement of up to 23 different specificities of CD8(+) T cells in a single reaction."
7617,This can greatly reduce the amount of starting clinical materials for a systematic screening of CD8(+) T cell epitopes.
7618,"In addition, this greatly enhanced capacity enables the incorporation of irrelevant epitopes for determining the non-specific killing activity of CD8(+) T cells, thereby allowing to measure the actual epitope-specific cytotoxicity activities."
7619,This technique is shown to be useful to study both human and mouse CD8(+) T cells.
7620,"Besides, our results from human PBMCs and three independent infectious animal models (MERS, influenza and malaria) further reveal that IFNγ expression by epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells does not always correlate with their cell-killing potential, highlighting the need for using cytotoxicity assays in specific contexts (e.g., evaluating vaccine candidates)."
7621,"Overall, our approach opens up new possibilities for comprehensive analyses of CD8(+) T cell cytotoxicity in a practical manner."
7622,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic liver disease and affects an estimated 3% of the world's population.
7623,"Options for the prevention or therapy of HCV infection are limited; there is no vaccine and the nonspecific, interferon-based treatments now in use are frequently ineffective and have significant side effects."
7624,"A small-animal model for HCV infection would significantly expedite antiviral compound development and preclinical testing, as well as open new avenues to decipher the mechanisms that underlie viral pathogenesis."
7625,"The natural species tropism of HCV is, however, limited to humans and chimpanzees."
7626,"Here, we discuss the prospects of developing a mouse model for HCV infection, taking into consideration recent results on HCV entry and replication, and new prospects in xenotransplantation biology."
7627,"We highlight three independent, but possibly complementary, approaches towards overcoming current species barriers and generating a small-animal model for HCV pathogenesis."
7628,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that leads to deleterious pulmonary pathological features.
7629,"Due to its high morbidity and mortality and widespread occurrence, SARS has evolved as an important respiratory disease which may be encountered everywhere in the world."
7630,The virus was identified as the causative agent of SARS due to the efforts of a WHO-led laboratory network.
7631,The potential mutability of the SARS-CoV genome may lead to new SARS outbreaks and several regions of the viral genomes open reading frames have been identified which may contribute to the severe virulence of the virus.
7632,"With regard to the pathogenesis of SARS, several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system may exist."
7633,"Vaccination would offer the most attractive approach to prevent new epidemics of SARS, but the development of vaccines is difficult due to missing data on the role of immune system-virus interactions and the potential mutability of the virus."
7634,"Even in a situation of no new infections, SARS remains a major health hazard, as new epidemics may arise."
7635,"Therefore, further experimental and clinical research is required to control the disease."
7636," Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a respiratory pathogen of chickens, causing severe economic losses in poultry industry worldwide."
7637,Live attenuated viruses are widely used in both the broiler and layer industry because of their efficacy and ability to be mass applied.
7638,"Recently, we established a novel reverse genetics system based on targeted RNA recombination to manipulate the genome of IBV strain H52."
7639,"Here we explore the possibilities to attenuate IBV in a rational way in order to generate safe and effective vaccines against virulent IBV (van Beurden et al., 2017)."
7640,"To this end, we deleted the nonessential group-specific accessory genes 3 and/or 5 in the IBV genome by targeted RNA recombination and selected the recombinant viruses in embryonated eggs."
7641,"The resulting recombinant (r) rIBV-Δ3ab, rIBV-Δ5ab, and rIBV-Δ3ab5ab could be rescued and grew to the same virus titer as recombinant and wild type IBV strain H52."
7642,"Thus, genes 3ab and 5ab are not essential for replication in ovo."
7643,"When administered to one-day-old chickens, rIBV-Δ3ab, rIBV-Δ5ab, and rIBV-Δ3ab5ab showed reduced ciliostasis as compared to rIBV H52 and wild type H52, indicating that the accessory genes contribute to the pathogenicity of IBV."
7644,"After homologous challenge with the virulent IBV strain M41, all vaccinated chickens were protected against disease based on reduced loss of ciliary movement in the trachea compared to the non-vaccinated but challenged controls."
7645,"Taken together, deletion of accessory genes 3ab and/or 5ab in IBV resulted in mutant viruses with an attenuated phenotype and the ability to induce protection in chickens."
7646,"Hence, targeted RNA recombination based on virulent IBV provides opportunities for the development of a next generation of rationally designed live attenuated IBV vaccines."
7647," Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy."
7648,"CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales."
7649,All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs.
7650,"CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans."
7651,"CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection."
7652,"Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease."
7653,"The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently."
7654,SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts.
7655,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), first reported in 2012, is likely transmitted from camels to humans with potentially fatal consequences."
7656,"To date, there are no approved vaccines or direct acting antiviral drugs to combat coronavirus infections in humans."
7657,The emergence or re-emergence of CoVs from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health.
7658,"Dengue is the most widespread vector-borne viral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) for which there are no safe, effective drugs approved for clinical use."
7659,"Here, by using sequential antigen panning of a yeast antibody library derived from healthy donors against the DENV envelop protein domain III (DIII) combined with depletion by an entry defective DIII mutant, we identified a cross-reactive human monoclonal antibody (mAb), m366.6, which bound with high affinity to DENV DIII from all four DENV serotypes."
7660,Immunogenetic analysis indicated that m366.6 is a germline-like mAb with very few somatic mutations from the closest VH and Vλ germline genes.
7661,"Importantly, we demonstrated that it potently neutralized DENV both in vitro and in the mouse models of DENV infection without detectable antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect."
7662,"The epitope of m366.6 was mapped to the highly conserved regions on DIII, which may guide the design of effective dengue vaccine immunogens."
7663,"Furthermore, as the first germline-like mAb derived from a naïve antibody library that could neutralize all four DENV serotypes, the m366.6 can be a tool for exploring mechanisms of DENV infection, and is a promising therapeutic candidate."
7664,"In recent decades, theory addressing the processes that underlie the dynamics of infectious diseases has progressed considerably."
7665,"Unfortunately, the availability of empirical data to evaluate these theories has not grown at the same pace."
7666,"Although laboratory animals have been widely used as models at the organism level, they have been less appropriate for addressing issues at the population level."
7667,"However, farm animal populations can provide empirical models to study infectious diseases at the population level."
7668,"During the past two decades, antibodies, antibody derivatives and vaccines have been developed for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in human and veterinary medicine."
7669,"Numerous species of dicot and monocot plants have been genetically modified to produce antibodies or vaccines, and a number of diverse transformation methods and strategies to enhance the accumulation of the pharmaceutical proteins are now available."
7670,"Veterinary applications are the specific focus of this article, in particular for pathogenic viruses, bacteria and eukaryotic parasites."
7671,"We focus on the advantages and remaining challenges of plant-based therapeutic proteins for veterinary applications with emphasis on expression platforms, technologies and economic considerations."
7672, Mucosal surfaces are common sites of pathogen colonization/entry.
7673,Effective mucosal immunity by vaccination should provide protection at this primary infection site.
7674,Our aim was to develop a new vaccination strategy that elicits a mucosal immune response.
7675,"A new strain of Enterococcus faecium, a non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with strong cell adhesion ability, was identified and used as a vaccine vector to deliver two model antigens."
7676,"Specifically, sigma (σ) C protein of avian reovirus (ARV), a functional homolog of mammalian reovirus σ1 protein and responsible for M-cell targeting, was administered together with a subfragment of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)."
7677,"Next, the effect of immunization route on the immune response was assessed by delivering the antigens via the LAB strain."
7678,Intranasal (IN) immunization induced stronger humoral responses than intragastic (IG) immunization.
7679,IN immunization produced antigen specific IgA both systemically and in the lungs.
7680,A higher IgA titer was induced by the LAB with ARV σC protein attached.
7681,"Moreover, the serum of mice immunized with LAB displaying divalent antigens had much stronger immune reactivity against ARV σC protein compared to IBV-S1."
7682,Our results indicate that ARV σC protein delivered by LAB via the IN route elicits strong mucosal immunity.
7683,"A needle-free delivery approach is a convenient and cost effective method of vaccine administration, especially for respiratory infections in economic animals."
7684,"Furthermore, ARV σC, a strong immunogen of ARV, may be able to serve as an immunoenhancer for other vaccines, especially avian vaccines."
7685, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a newly identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remains a threat to cause epidemics as evidenced by recent sporadic cases in China.
7686,"In this communication, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of two SARS vaccine candidates based on the recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing SARS-CoV spike or nucleocapsid proteins in ferrets."
7687,No clinical signs were observed in all the ferrets challenged with SARS-CoV.
7688,"On the other hand, vaccination did not prevent SARS-CoV infection in ferrets."
7689,"In contrast, immunized ferrets (particularly those immunized with rMVA-spike) exhibited significantly stronger inflammatory responses and focal necrosis in liver tissue after SARS-CoV challenge than control animals."
7690,"Thus, our data suggest that enhanced hepatitis is linked to vaccination with rMVA expressing SARS-CoV antigens."
7691,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed individuals, such as transplant recipients or people living with HIV/AIDS, and congenital CMV is the leading viral cause of developmental disabilities in infants."
7692,"Due to the highly species-specific nature of CMV, animal models that closely recapitulate human CMV (HCMV) are of growing importance for vaccine development."
7693,Here we present the genomic sequence of a novel nonhuman primate CMV from cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis; CyCMV).
7694,"CyCMV (Ottawa strain) was isolated from the urine of a healthy, captive-bred, 4-year-old cynomolgus macaque of Philippine origin, and the viral genome was sequenced using next-generation Illumina sequencing to an average of 516-fold coverage."
7695,"The CyCMV genome is 218,041 bp in length, with 49.5% G+C content and 84% protein-coding density."
7696,We have identified 262 putative open reading frames (ORFs) with an average coding length of 789 bp.
7697,The genomic organization of CyCMV is largely colinear with that of rhesus macaque CMV (RhCMV).
7698,"Of the 262 CyCMV ORFs, 137 are homologous to HCMV genes, 243 are homologous to RhCMV 68.1, and 200 are homologous to RhCMV 180.92."
7699,"CyCMV encodes four ORFs that are not present in RhCMV strain 68.1 or 180.92 but have homologies with HCMV (UL30, UL74A, UL126, and UL146)."
7700,"Similar to HCMV, CyCMV does not produce the RhCMV-specific viral homologue of cyclooxygenase-2."
7701,This newly characterized CMV may provide a novel model in which to study CMV biology and HCMV vaccine development.
7702," Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) infection of BALB/c mice induces bronchiolitis leading to a fatal pneumonia in a dose-dependent manner, closely paralleling the development of severe disease during human respiratory syncytial virus infection in man, and is thus a recognised model in which to study the pathogenesis of pneumoviruses."
7703,This model system was used to investigate delivery of the internal structural proteins of PVM as a potential vaccination strategy to protect against pneumovirus disease.
7704,Replication-deficient recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vectors were constructed that expressed the M or N gene of PVM pathogenic strain J3666.
7705,"Intranasal delivery of these rAd5 vectors gave protection against a lethal challenge dose of PVM in three different mouse strains, and protection lasted for at least 20 weeks post-immunisation."
7706,"Whilst the PVM-specific antibody response in such animals was weak and inconsistent, rAd5N primed a strong PVM-specific CD8+ T cell response and, to a lesser extent, a CD4+ T cell response."
7707,These findings suggest that T-cell responses may be more important than serum IgG in the observed protection induced by rAd5N.
7708,  This chapter focuses on four important questions that remain unanswered: (1) what is the importance of virus serotype in formulating an optimal vaccine?
7709,(2) which immunological effector arm most likely protects against rotavirus disease?
7710,(3) by what means is virus antigen best presented to the host to elicit a protective immune response?
7711,(4) what are the advantages and disadvantages of replicating agents as compared to nonreplicating agents as candidate rotavirus vaccines?
7712,"Although two proteins (vp4 and vp7) are probably important in inducing protection against challenge, it has not been clearly demonstrated that inclusion of the epidemiologically important human P or G type is important in protection against human disease."
7713,No immunological effector arm clearly explains protection against heterotypic challenge.
7714,Protection against disease is not predicted by rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies in serum.
7715,"Oral inoculation may not be necessary to induce a protective, virus-specific immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface, but parenteral inoculation of experimental animals with rotavirus induces an immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface that is protective against challenge."
7716,Induction of a rotavirus-specific protective immune response is probably associated with the presence of virus-specific T and B cells in intestinal lymphoid tissues and virus-specific sIgA or IgG at the intestinal mucosal surface.
7717,There is some experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that neither rotavirus replication nor presentation of rotavirus antigen to the intestinal mucosal surface is necessary to achieve this aim.
7718,A major challenge for research on influenza vaccines is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans.
7719,"Vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans, with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines."
7720,Many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza were conducted in human subjects.
7721,Studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past.
7722,"Therefore, as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues, it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, and a major challenge for research on influenza vaccines is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans."
7723,The emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (AI) viruses and the threat of a pandemic caused by AI viruses of this or another subtype has resulted in a resurgence of interest in influenza vaccine research.
7724,"The development of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents a unique set of obstacles, not the least of which is that the demonstration of efficacy in humans is not possible."
7725,"Since the correlates of protection from pandemic influenza are not known, we rely on extrapolation of lessons from seasonal influenza vaccines and on data from the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in animal models to guide our decisions on vaccines for use in humans."
7726,The features and contributions of commonly used animal models for influenza vaccine research are discussed.
7727,Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012.
7728,A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps.
7729,Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines.
7730,"We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV."
7731,"Results: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed."
7732,"Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa."
7733,"However, despite evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown."
7734,"There have been sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East."
7735,"Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include environmental contamination."
7736,"Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials."
7737,At least one candidate vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials.
7738,"Conclusions: There has been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural history of the infection."
7739,"There have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease."
7740,Terms such as “camel exposure” and the epidemiological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized.
7741,We strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database.
7742,"Coronaviruses will likely continue to emerge, arguing for a unified “One Health” approach."
7743,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a tick-borne bunyavirus, can cause a life-threatening hemorrhagic syndrome in humans but not in its animal host."
7744,"The virus is widely distributed throughout southeastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia."
7745,Disease management has proven difficult and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics.
7746,Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing foreign glycoproteins (GP) have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers.
7747,"Here, we developed and assessed a replication competent rVSV vector expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which encodes CCHFV structural glycoproteins."
7748,"This construct drives strong expression of CCHFV-GP, in vitro."
7749,"Using these vectors, we vaccinated STAT-1 knock-out mice, an animal model for CCHFV."
7750,The vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of CCHFV.
7751,Anti-CCHFV-GP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals.
7752,This study demonstrates that a rVSV expressing only the CCHFV-GP has the potential to serve as a replication competent vaccine platform against CCHF infections.
7753,Induction of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific cytotoxic T cells by therapeutic immunization may be a strategy to treat chronic hepatitis B.
7754,"In the HBV animal model, woodchucks, the application of DNA vaccine expressing woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) core antigen (WHcAg) in combination with antivirals led to the prolonged control of viral replication."
7755,"However, it became clear that the use of more potent vaccines is required to overcome WHV persistence."
7756,"Therefore, we asked whether stronger and more functional T-cell responses could be achieved using the modified vaccines and an optimized prime-boost vaccination regimen."
7757,We developed a new DNA plasmid (pCGWHc) and recombinant adenoviruses (AdVs) showing high expression levels of WHcAg.
7758,Mice vaccinated with the improved plasmid pCGWHc elicited a stronger WHcAg-specific CD8(+) T-cell response than with the previously used vaccines.
7759,"Using multicolor flow cytometry and an in vivo cytotoxicity assay, we showed that immunization in a DNA prime-AdV boost regimen resulted in an even more vigorous and functional T-cell response than immunization with the new plasmid alone."
7760,"Immunization of naïve woodchucks with pCGWHc plasmid or AdVs induced a significant WHcAg-specific degranulation response prior to the challenge, this response had not been previously detected."
7761,"Consistently, this response led to a rapid control of infection after the challenge."
7762,Our results demonstrate that high antigen expression levels and the DNA prime-AdV boost immunization improved the T-cell response in mice and induced significant T-cell responses in woodchucks.
7763,"Therefore, this new vaccination strategy may be a candidate for a therapeutic vaccine against chronic HBV infection."
7764," In this study, we compare the development of infection and/or disease in Beagle dogs intradermally infected with Leishmania chagasi, in the presence or absence of Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva, with those of intravenously infected animals."
7765,Spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for Leishmania DNA.
7766,"Positive spleen cultures for Leishmania were detected earlier (P≤0.018) and were more frequent (five out of the five animals) in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals, in presence (two out of the six animals) or absence (three out of the five animals) of salivary gland lysate of L. longipalpis."
7767,Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P=0.004).
7768,"In addition, dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite DNA were, nevertheless, negative for anti-Leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection."
7769,"Only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit (Pearson r=−0.8076, P=0.0026) and hemoglobin (Pearson r=−0.8403, P=0.0012) during the infection period."
7770,No significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals.
7771,The data presented herein confirms that the intradermal inoculation of dogs with Leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection.
7772,It also fails to show an advantage in using L. longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine leishmaniasis.
7773,Comment on “Gain-of-Function Research and the Relevance to Clinical Practice”
7774," WHO has listed several priority diseases with epidemic potential for which there are no, or insufficient, medical countermeasures."
7775,"In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X."
7776,"Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential."
7777,We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination.
7778,"We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic."
7779,"Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides."
7780,"These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms."
7781,"In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies."
7782,We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development.
7783,"We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design, chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures."
7784,We intend to cover these topics in future publications.
7785,Metacyclic Leishmania promastigotes are transmitted by sand flies that inject parasites and saliva into the host's skin.
7786,"Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA plasmids encoding Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary proteins LJM17 and LJL143, when used to immunize dogs, resulted in a systemic and local Th1 cell-mediated immunity that interfered in parasite survival in vitro."
7787,Here we evaluated the ability of these same salivary antigens to induce anti-Leishmania immunity and to confer protection by immunizing dogs using a novel vaccination strategy more suitable for use in the field.
7788,The strategy consisted of a single dose of plasmid followed by two doses of recombinant Canarypoxvirus (rCanarypoxvirus) expressing L. longipalpis salivary proteins (LJM17 or LJL143).
7789,"Thirty days after the final immunization, dogs were intradermally challenged with 10(7) Leishmania infantum promastigotes in the presence of L. longipalpis saliva."
7790,"We followed the experimentally infected dogs for 10 months to characterize clinical, parasitological, and immunological parameters."
7791,"Upon vaccination, all immunized dogs presented strong and specific humoral responses with increased serum concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-7, and IL-15."
7792,"The serum of dogs immunized with LJM17 also exhibited high levels of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-18."
7793,"L. infantum infection was established in all experimental groups as evidenced by the presence of anti-Leishmania IgG, and by parasite detection in the spleen and skin."
7794,"Dogs immunized with LJM17-based vaccines presented higher circulating levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, TNF, CXCL10, and GM-CSF post-infection when compared with controls."
7795,"Results demonstrated that relevant Leishmania-specific immune responses were induced following vaccination of dogs with L. longipalpis salivary antigen LJM17 administered in a single priming dose of plasmid DNA, followed by two booster doses of recombinant Canarypox vector."
7796,"Importantly, a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines known to be relevant for protection against leishmaniasis was evidenced after challenging LJM17-vaccinated dogs as compared to controls."
7797,"Although similar results were observed following immunization with LJL143, the pro-inflammatory response observed after immunization was attenuated following infection."
7798,"Collectively, these data suggest that the LJM17-based vaccine induced an immune profile consistent with the expected protective immunity against canine leishmaniosis."
7799,"These results clearly support the need for further evaluation of the LJM17 antigen, using a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy against canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL)."
7800, Continuous efforts have been made to develop a prophylactic vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
7801,"In this study, two recombinant baculoviruses, vAc-N and vAc-S, were constructed, which contained the mammalian-cell activate promoter element, human elongation factor 1α-subunit (EF-1α), the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter, and the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) gene of bat SARS-like CoV (SL-CoV) under the control of the CMV promoter."
7802,"Mice were subcutaneously and intraperitoneally injected with recombinant baculovirus, and both humoral and cellular immune responses were induced in the vaccinated groups."
7803,"The secretion level of IFN-γ was much higher than that of IL-4 in vAc-N or vAc-S immunized groups, suggesting a strong Th1 bias towards cellular immune responses."
7804,"Additionally, a marked increase of CD4 T cell immune responses and high levels of anti-SARS-CoV humoral responses were also detected in the vAc-N or vAc-S immunized groups."
7805,"In contrast, there were significantly weaker cellular immune responses, as well as less antibody production than in the control groups."
7806,Our data demonstrates that the recombinant baculovirus can serve as an effective vaccine strategy.
7807,"In addition, because effective SARS vaccines should act to not only prevent the reemergence of SARS-CoV, but also to provide cross-protection against SL-CoV, findings in this study may have implications for developing such cross-protective vaccines."
7808,The wide array of models available for the study of respiratory viral infections is extremely valuable for the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic options against these highly prevalent diseases.
7809,"In addition, through these models we have gathered considerable insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these infections and the inflammatory and immune responses they elicit in the host."
7810,This article reviews new promising models introduced recently in this field.
7811,"Section Editor: Alastair Stewart – University of Melbourne, Australia There has long been interest in the potential relationships between viral respiratory illness and chronic respiratory disease."
7812,"However, until relatively recently there have been few attempts to develop animal models that address chronic influences of acute and chronic infections."
7813,"Professor Piedimonte and colleagues provide a commentary on the impact of molecular biology on studies of viral infection and address the important issues that arise in selecting appropriate strains and species to model the course of infection, inflammation and long term sequelae."
7814,"Nipah (Nee-pa) viral disease is a zoonotic infection caused by Nipah virus (NiV), a paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae."
7815,"It is a biosafety level-4 pathogen, which is transmitted by specific types of fruit bats, mainly Pteropus spp."
7816,which are natural reservoir host.
7817,The disease was reported for the first time from the Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia in 1998.
7818,Human-to-human transmission also occurs.
7819,Outbreaks have been reported also from other countries in South and Southeast Asia.
7820,Phylogenetic analysis affirmed the circulation of two major clades of NiV as based on currently available complete N and G gene sequences.
7821,"NiV isolates from Malaysia and Cambodia clustered together in NiV-MY clade, whereas isolates from Bangladesh and India clusterered within NiV-BD clade."
7822,NiV isolates from Thailand harboured mixed population of sequences.
7823,"In humans, the virus is responsible for causing rapidly progressing severe illness which might be characterized by severe respiratory illness and/or deadly encephalitis."
7824,"In pigs below six months of age, respiratory illness along with nervous symptoms may develop."
7825,Different types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays along with molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction have been developed for diagnostic purposes.
7826,"Due to the expensive nature of the antibody drugs, identification of broad-spectrum antivirals is essential along with focusing on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)."
7827,"High pathogenicity of NiV in humans, and lack of vaccines or therapeutics to counter this disease have attracted attention of researchers worldwide for developing effective NiV vaccine and treatment regimens."
7828," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has overwhelmed more than 30 countries claiming nearly 8400 cases with over 800 fatalities."
7829,"Thanks to the unprecedented international collaboration, the whole-genomes of SARS-CoVs were successfully deciphered shortly after the identification of the causative pathogen for outbreak of SARS in southern China, in 2003."
7830,"Hitherto, the SARS-CoV, as a viral paradigm of emerging infectious entities, has been extensively studied that has ranged from epidemiology, molecular virology/immunology to structural genomics."
7831,"Also, several lines of breakthroughs have been record-brokenly obtained, that included the finding of ACE2, a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, solution of the 3CLpro structure, a first crystal structure of SARS-related macromolecules, revealing of bats as natural reservoirs for SARS-like viruses and the possible involvement of civet cats in the SARS emergence."
7832,"This review intends to outline the major progress in the journey of SARS-related exploration, by emphasizing those inaugurated studies with milestone-like significance contributed by Chinese research groups."
7833,Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an infectious virus that was first reported in 2012.
7834,"The MERS-CoV genome encodes four major structural proteins, among which the spike (S) protein has a key role in viral infection and pathogenesis."
7835,The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and is an important target for development of MERS vaccines and therapeutics.
7836,"In this review, we describe the relevant features of the MERS-CoV S-protein RBD, summarize recent advances in the development of MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, and illustrate potential challenges and strategies to further improve their efficacy."
7837," Systems biology is an interdisciplinary research field in life sciences, which involves a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the interactions between all of the components of biological systems over time."
7838,For the past 50years the discipline of virology has overly focused on the pathogen itself.
7839,"However, we now know that the host response is equally or more important in defining the eventual pathological outcome of infection."
7840,Systems biology has in recent years been increasingly recognised for its importance to infectious disease research.
7841,Host-virus interactions can be better understood by taking into account the dynamical molecular networks that constitute a biological system.
7842,To decipher the pathobiological mechanisms of any disease requires a deep knowledge of how multiple and concurrent signal-transduction pathways operate and are deregulated.
7843,Hence the intricacies of signalling pathways can be dissected only by system level approaches.
7844,: Few studies have evaluated the relative cross-protection conferred by infection with different groups of viruses through studies of sequential infections in humans.
7845,We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI).
7846,"METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point."
7847,"ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI."
7848,"RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14–.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38–.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode."
7849,Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P < .001).
7850,"Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062–.093), while men with influenza virus–positive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081)."
7851,CONCLUSION: Prior adenovirus or influenza virus infection conferred cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes relative to prior infection due to other circulating viruses.
7852, The Global Virus Network (GVN) was established in 2011 to strengthen research and responses to emerging viral causes of human disease and to prepare against new viral pandemics.
7853,There are now 40 GVN Centers of Excellence and 6 Affiliate laboratories in 24 countries.
7854,"The 2017 meeting was held from September 25–27 in Melbourne, Australia, and was hosted by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and the Institut Pasteur."
7855,"This report highlights the recent accomplishments of GVN researchers in several important areas of medical virology, including the recent Zika epidemic, infections by human papillomavirus, influenza, HIV, hepatitis C, HTLV-1, and chikungunya viruses, and new and emerging viruses in the Australasia region."
7856,Plans for the 2018 meeting also are noted.
7857,PURPOSE: The large number of deaths in a short period of time due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection led to the unparalleled collaborative efforts world wide to determine and characterize the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
7858,The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the Canadian group with international collaboration.
7859,"As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS makes this area a priority for future research."
7860,"To prevent deaths in the future, early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance."
7861,METHODS: This review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of viral infection.
7862,"RESULTS: The three major diagnostic methods available for SARS includes viral RNA detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (NP)."
7863,The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies.
7864,The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein contains multiple conformational epitopes that induces highly potent neutralizing antibodies.
7865,The genetically engineered attenuated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein has been shown to elicit protective immunity in vaccinated animals.
7866,CONCLUSION: NP is the preferred target for routine detection of SARS-CoV infection by ELISA which is an economical method compared to other methods.
7867,The RBD of the spike glycoprotein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutralizing determinant of SARS-CoV.
7868,The progress in evaluating a therapeutic or vaccine would depend on the availability of clinically relevant animal model.
7869,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which currently constitute the main class of biotherapeutics, are now recognized as major medical tools that are increasingly being considered to fight severe viral infections."
7870,"Indeed, the number of antiviral mAbs developed in recent years has grown exponentially."
7871,"Although their direct effects on viral blunting have been studied in detail, their potential immunomodulatory actions have been overlooked until recently."
7872,The ability of antiviral mAbs to modulate antiviral immune responses in infected organisms has recently been revealed.
7873,"More specifically, upon recognition of their cognate antigens, mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) that can be recognized by the Fc receptors expressed on different immune cells of infected individuals."
7874,This binding may be followed by the modulation of the host immune responses.
7875,Harnessing this immunomodulatory property may facilitate improvements in the therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs.
7876,This review focuses on the role of ICs formed with different viral determinants and mAbs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in the context of both passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies.
7877,Potential deleterious effects of ICs on the host immune response are also discussed.
7878,"Sustained adaptive immunity to pathogens provides effective protection against infections, and effector cells located at the site of infection ensure rapid response to the challenge."
7879,Both are essential for the success of vaccine development.
7880,"To explore new vaccination approach against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection, we have shown that Rv3615c, identified as ESX‐1 substrate protein C of M.tb but not expressed in BCG, induced a dominant Th1‐type response of CD4(+) T cells from patients with tuberculosis pleurisy, which suggests a potential candidate for vaccine development."
7881,"But subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c induced modest T‐cell responses systemically, and showed suboptimal protection against virulent M.tb challenge at the site of infection."
7882,"Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c induces sustained capability of adaptive CD4(+) T‐ and B‐cell responses in lung parenchyma and airway."
7883,"Rv3615c contains a dominant epitope of mouse CD4(+) T cells, Rv3615c(41‐50), and elicits CD4(+) T‐cell response with an effector–memory phenotype and multi‐Th1‐type cytokine coexpressions."
7884,"Since T cells resident at mucosal tissue are potent at control of infection at early stage, our data show that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c promotes a sustained regional immunity to M.tb, and suggests a potency in control of M.tb infection."
7885,Our study warranties a further investigation of Rv3615c as a candidate for development of effective vaccination against M.tb infection.
7886,"In the last decades, several viruses emerged, as the consequence of cross-species passage from animal reservoirs to human being."
7887,Emerging infections always represent a significant challenge for public health system as knowledge about specific pathogens are generally little while and no/few effective interventions are available.
7888,"In this volume we explored special aspects of emerging infectious diseases including: the application of the theory of focality of diseases to infective syndrome; the human-animal inter-face focusing on influenza; the role of bats as main reservoir of emerging and novel human pathogens; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemiology and clinical presentation; immediate impact on human health of the last Zika virus outbreak occurred in Pacific Ocean and the Americas; the role and potential application of animal models for the study of emerging infections, to improve disease knowledge and for developing therapeutic drugs during ongoing outbreak."
7889,Polysaccharide-encapsulated fungi are the chief source of diseases in immunocompromised hosts such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus or neutropenia patients.
7890,Currently available polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are mainly T cell dependent and are usually ineffective in weakened immune systems.
7891,"In this study, laminarin, a well-characterized β-1,3-glucan, was conjugated with a prokaryotically expressed recombinant fragment (amino acids [aa] 39 to 272) of calreticulin (rCRT/39–272), which exhibits extraordinarily potent immunogenicity and adjuvanticity in experimental animals."
7892,The resultant conjugate reserves the immunostimulatory effect of rCRT/39–272 on naïve murine B cells and is capable of eliciting anti-β-glucan IgG (mostly IgG1) responses in not only BALB/c mice but also athymic nude mice.
7893,Laminarin-CRT-induced mouse antibodies (Abs) are able to bind with Candida albicans and inhibit its growth in vitro.
7894,"In addition, vaccination with laminarin-CRT partially protects mice from lethal C. albicans challenge."
7895,These results imply that rCRT/39–272 could be used as an ideal carrier or adjuvant for carbohydrate vaccines aimed at inducing or boosting IgG responses to fungal infections in immunodeficient hosts.
7896,Vaccinia virus (VACV) is one of the most extensively-studied viruses of the Poxviridae family.
7897,"It is easy to genetically modify, so it has become a key tool for many applications."
7898,"In this context, reporter genes facilitate the study of the role of foreign genes introduced into the genome of VACV."
7899,"In this review, we describe the type of reporter genes that have been used to generate reporter-expressing VACV and the applications of the recombinant viruses obtained."
7900,"Reporter-expressing VACV are currently employed in basic and immunology research, in the development of vaccines and cancer treatment."
7901," The major structural protein VP2 of porcine parvovirus (PPV) was used as the model parvovirus antigen, which has been expressed in Lactobacillus casei fusing with Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) as mucosal adjuvant."
7902,"The VP2-LTB DNA fragment was cloned into vector pPG611 or pPG612 to generated inducible surface-displayed and secretion expression systems based on xylose promoter, designated as rLc:pPG611-VP2-LTB (recombinant L. casei) and rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB, respectively."
7903,"Expression of the fusion protein was verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blot immunofluorescence and electron microscopy."
7904,"It was observed that the level of IgG or sIgA from mice orally immunized with VP2-LTB was higher than that from mice received VP2 and negative control, which demonstrated significantly statistically different."
7905,"Especially, the titer of IgG or sIgA in mice immunized with rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB is the highest in this study."
7906,"In summary, LTB as mucosal adjuvant was able to effectively facilitate induction of mucosal and systemic immunity by L. casei-expressing VP2 fusion protein."
7907, We describe a three-color flow cytometry assay for the detection of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the cat.
7908,"The assay is based upon detection of intracellular TNFα using the cross-reactive mAb 6401.1111, raised against the human cytokine."
7909,"Allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb 6401.1111 specifically stained feline TNFα-producing murine cells and also Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B-stimulated feline T cells, thus providing formal evidence for cross-reactivity."
7910,"By using the anti-TNFα mAb in combination with PE- and FITC-conjugated mAbs against feline CD4 and CD8, respectively, antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells could be identified in the peripheral blood and in the spleens of feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cats."
7911,"Moreover, feline calicivirus (FCV)-specific CD4+ T cells were detected in the spleens of FCV-vaccinated cats."
7912,"As antigen-presenting cells (APCs), we used immortalized autologous fibroblast cell lines, PBMC or splenocytes."
7913,"A straightforward protocol, in which splenocyte preparations served both as APCs and effector cells, consistently yielded best results."
7914,The assay will permit further studies of the cellular immune responses in cats during natural and experimental viral infections.
7915,"It will contribute to vaccine development against feline viruses by facilitating the identification of T cell antigens and epitopes, and by allowing the quantitative detection of virus-specific T cells after vaccination."
7916,"Furthermore, the assay will add to the value of those systems in which viral infections of the cat serve as models for human disease."
7917,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but it remains obscure whether EBV is a viral cause of, or only an accompaniment of, NPC."
7918,"We will discuss the accumulated evidence pointing to the relationship between EBV infection and NPC initiation from epidemiologic, pathogenic, molecular oncogenic, and experimental animal studies."
7919,We believe that convincing evidence from these perspectives must be provided before we can ascertain the causal role of EBV infection in NPC.
7920,"Specifically, (1) epidemiological studies should reveal EBV infection as a risk factor; (2) the introduction of EBV into an animal model should produce NPC; (3) in the animal model NPC, the main molecular event(s) or the involved signaling pathway(s) should be identical to that in human NPC; and (4) finally and most importantly, prevention of EBV infection or clearance of EBV from infected individuals must be able to reduce the incidence rate of NPC."
7921,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory infection, particularly in children, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly."
7922,"HMPV, which is closely related to avian metapneumovirus subtype C, has circulated for at least 65 years, and nearly every child will be infected with HMPV by the age of 5."
7923,"However, immunity is incomplete, and re-infections occur throughout adult life."
7924,"Symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections, ranging from mild (cough, rhinorrhea, and fever) to more severe (bronchiolitis and pneumonia)."
7925,The preferred method for diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as HMPV is difficult to culture.
7926,"Although there have been many advances made in the past 16 years since its discovery, there are still no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals or vaccines available to treat HMPV."
7927,Both small animal and non-human primate models have been established for the study of HMPV.
7928,"This review will focus on the epidemiology, transmission, and clinical manifestations in humans as well as the animal models of HMPV pathogenesis and host immune response."
7929,Cross-species transmission of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) can result in pandemic disease outbreaks.
7930,"Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, has caused 182 cases to date, with ~43% mortality, and no small animal model has been reported."
7931,"MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (β-CoV) subgroup 2c share >65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are significant drug and vaccine targets."
7932,"BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c β-CoVs."
7933,We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE).
7934,"This virus replicates efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells."
7935,"Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge."
7936,"Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice."
7937,"Passaged virus was characterized by mutations in the nsp13, nsp14, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) and M genes."
7938,"Finally, we identified an inhibitor active against the nsp5 proteases of subgroup 2c β-CoVs."
7939,"Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad-based therapeutics, evaluating vaccine outcomes, and studying viral pathogenesis."
7940,The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans.
7941,"In this study, we examine the disease potential for SARS-like CoVs currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations."
7942,"Utilizing the SARS-CoV infectious clone, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse adapted SARS-CoV backbone."
7943,"The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild type backbone can efficiently utilize multiple ACE2 receptor orthologs, replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells, and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV."
7944,"Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis."
7945,Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from CoVs utilizing the novel spike protein.
7946,"Importantly, based on these findings, we synthetically rederived an infectious full length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo."
7947,"Together, the work highlights a continued risk of SARS-CoV reemergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations."
7948," The 30th International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) was held in Atlanta, GA, USA from May 18 to 21, 2017."
7949,"This report provides an account of award lectures, invited keynote addresses and oral presentations during the meeting."
7950,"The 2017 Gertrude Elion Memorial Lecture Award by Michael Sofia highlighted one of the most important accomplishments in recent drug discovery in antiviral research, the identification of the hepatitis C virus direct-acting antiviral sofosbuvir and new alternatives to combat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection."
7951,The Antonín Holý Lecture Award by David Chu on medicinal chemistry provided an overview of early developments of nucleoside analogs for the treatment of HIV and varicella zoster virus infection and how this knowledge serves to develop new drugs targeting HBV.
7952,Priscilla Yang gave the first ISAR Women in Science lecture.
7953,"She reported on pharmacological validation of new antiviral targets for dengue, Zika and other flaviviruses."
7954,"The William Prusoff Young Investigator Lecture Award by Maaike Everts described the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance and the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Consortium, and how they are helping to accelerate the development of new antivirals."
7955,The 30th ICAR was a success in promoting new discoveries in antiviral drug development and research.
7956,"The 31st ICAR will be held in Porto, Portugal, June 11–15, 2018."
7957, Farmers attempting to reduce first-calving age (FCA) need to understand which rearing management factors influence FCA and first-lactation milk production (FLP).
7958,Reduced FCA might be associated with lower FLP.
7959,"This study describes the association between herd FCA, FLP, and several herd-level health and rearing management variables and describes the association between FCA and FLP at the cow level."
7960,"It uses data from a 2010 survey of 100 Dutch dairy farms about general management, colostrum and milk feeding, housing, cleanliness, healthcare, disease, and breeding."
7961,It also used available data on FCA and 305-d FLP at both cow and herd level.
7962,The associations between median FCA and median FLP of the herd and herd-level health and rearing management variables were determined using multivariate regression analysis.
7963,"The median FCA was associated with minimum age of first insemination, feeding of waste milk, and the amount of milk given preweaning."
7964,The median FLP was associated with median FCA and vaccination status for bovine respiratory syncytial virus.
7965,"The association between FCA and FLP (based on 8,454 heifers) was analyzed with a single-effect linear mixed model, where the dependent variable was either FCA or relative FCA (defined as the difference between FCA of the heifer and median FCA of the herd to which they belonged)."
7966,"Heifers having an FCA of 24mo produced, on average, 7,164kg of milk per 305d, and calving 1mo earlier gave 143kg less milk per 305d."
7967,"When FCA did not deviate from the median herd FCA, heifers produced, on average, 7,272kg of milk per 305d."
7968,"From the median FCA of the herd, heifers calving 1mo earlier produced 90kg of milk per 305d less, and heifers calving 1mo later produced 86kg per 305d more."
7969,This is the first study that explained FLP using relative FCA.
7970,It assumes that heifers raised within the same farm have similar development because they are similarly managed.
7971,"Similar management is reflected by the median FCA of the herd, with a deviation of the heifer’s FCA from median FCA reflecting the heifer’s development relative to the herd’s average."
7972,The advantage of using relative FCA was that it accounts for between-farm differences in rearing management.
7973,It showed that earlier insemination without adjusting management to ensure sufficient development lowers FLP.
7974,"An economic optimum exists between rearing costs, FCA, and FLP and, as a consequence, decisions with regard to young stock management should be made with care."
7975,New treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) focused on B cells have created an atmosphere of excitement in the MS community.
7976,"B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS."
7977,The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset.
7978,Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway.
7979,"Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention."
7980,: Imported cases threaten rabies reemergence in rabies-free areas.
7981,"During 2000–2005, five dog and one human rabies cases were imported into France, a rabies-free country since 2001."
7982,The Summer 2004 event led to unprecedented media warnings by the French Public Health Director.
7983,We investigated medical practice evolution following the official elimination of rabies in 2001; impact of subsequent episodic rabies importations and national newspaper coverage on demand for and delivery of antirabies prophylaxis; regular transmission of epidemiological developments within the French Antirabies Medical Center (ARMC) network; and ARMC discussions on indications of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP).
7984,METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Annual data collected by the National Reference Center for Rabies NRCR (1989–2006) and the exhaustive database (2000–2005) of 56 ARMC were analyzed.
7985,Weekly numbers of patients consulting at ARMC and their RPEP- and antirabies-immunoglobulin (ARIG) prescription rates were determined.
7986,Autoregressive integrated moving-average modeling and regression with autocorrelated errors were applied to examine how 2000–2005 episodic rabies events and their related national newspaper coverage affected demand for and delivery of RPEP.
7987,"A slight, continuous decline of rabies-dedicated public health facility attendance was observed from 2000 to 2004."
7988,"Then, during the Summer 2004 event, patient consultations and RPEP and ARIG prescriptions increased by 84%, 19.7% and 43.4%, respectively."
7989,"Moreover, elevated medical resource use persisted in 2005, despite communication efforts, without any secondary human or animal case."
7990,"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated appropriate responsiveness to reemerging rabies cases and effective newspaper reporting, as no secondary case occurred."
7991,"However, the ensuing demand on medical resources had immediate and long-lasting effects on rabies-related public health resources and expenses."
7992,"Henceforth, when facing such an event, decision-makers must anticipate the broad impact of their media communications to counter the emerging risk on maintaining an optimal public health organization and implement a post-crisis communication strategy."
7993,"SUMMARY: In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases."
7994,"Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment."
7995,"This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders."
7996,"Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options."
7997,"This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health."
7998,Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as emerging or reemerging infectious diseases are an even more serious threat and have not been adequately examined or discussed in terms of their unique risk characteristics.
7999,This review sets out to identify emerging and reemerging neglected tropical diseases and explore the policy and innovation environment that could hamper or enable control efforts.
8000,"Through this examination, we hope to raise awareness and guide potential approaches to addressing this global health concern."
8001,The family Arenaviridae contains several pathogens of major clinical importance.
8002,"The Old World (OW) arenavirus Lassa virus is endemic in West Africa and is estimated to cause up to 300,000 infections each year."
8003,The New World (NW) arenaviruses Junín and Machupo periodically cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in South America.
8004,"While these arenaviruses are highly pathogenic in humans, recent evidence indicates that pathogenic OW and NW arenaviruses interact with the host immune system differently, which may have differential impacts on viral pathogenesis."
8005,Severe Lassa fever cases are characterized by profound immunosuppression.
8006,"In contrast, pathogenic NW arenavirus infections are accompanied by elevated levels of Type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines."
8007,"This review aims to summarize recent findings about interactions of these pathogenic arenaviruses with the innate immune machinery and the subsequent effects on adaptive immunity, which may inform the development of vaccines and therapeutics against arenavirus infections."
8008,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that emerged in 2012, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pneumonia-like symptoms, and multi-organ failure, with a case fatality rate of ~36%."
8009,"Limited clinical studies indicate that humans infected with MERS-CoV exhibited pathology consistent with late stages of ARDS, which is reminiscent of disease observed in patients infected with SARS coronavirus."
8010,"Models of MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease have been difficult to achieve, and small animal models traditionally used to investigate viral pathogenesis (mouse, hamster, guinea pig, and ferret) are naturally resistant to MERS-CoV."
8011,"Therefore, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to modify the mouse genome to encode two human amino acids (288 and 330) in the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, making mice susceptible to MERS-CoV replication."
8012,"Serial MERS-CoV passage in these engineered mice was then used to generate a mouse-adapted virus that replicated efficiently within the lungs, and evoked symptoms indicative of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including decreased survival, extreme weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pathological signs indicative of end stage lung disease."
8013,"Importantly, therapeutic countermeasures comprising MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody treatment or a MERS-CoV spike protein vaccine protected engineered mice against MERS-CoV-induced ARDS."
8014," Viral metagenomics, modeling of protein structure, and manipulation of viral genetics are key approaches that have laid the foundations of our understanding of coronavirus biology."
8015,"In this review, we discuss the major advances each method has provided and discuss how future studies should leverage these strategies synergistically to answer novel questions."
8016,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in detection of Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) among patients with severe respiratory infections worldwide."
8017,"EV-D68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen; however, due to lack of a permissive animal model for EV-D68, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against EV-D68 has been hampered."
8018,"Recently, it was shown that EV-D68 has a strong affinity for α2,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) and we have shown previously that α2,6-linked SAs are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus)."
8019,"Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection."
8020,"Here, we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated EV-D68 strains (VANBT/1 and MO/14/49), along with the historical prototype Fermon strain (ATCC), to infect cotton rats."
8021,We found that cotton rats are permissive to EV-D68 infection without virus adaptation.
8022,The different strains of EV-D68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody (NA) upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization.
8023,Infection with the VANBT/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology.
8024,"Intramuscular immunization with live VANBT/1 or MO/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses, but a moderate heterologous NA response."
8025,We showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of NA against VANBT/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy.
8026,"VANBT/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from VANBT/1 challenge, but induced strong pulmonary Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology, indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization."
8027,"In conclusion, our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis, immune response, anti-viral therapies and vaccines against EV-D68 infection."
8028,We conducted a challenge/rechallenge trial in which 3 alpacas were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
8029,The alpacas shed virus at challenge but were refractory to further shedding at rechallenge on day 21.
8030,The trial indicates that alpacas may be suitable models for infection and shedding dynamics of this virus.
8031,"Influenza viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae and include influenza virus types A, B, and C. This introduction provides an overview of influenza virus classification, structure, and life cycle."
8032,We also include a brief review of the clinical manifestations of influenza and the molecular determinants for virulence.
8033,"The genetic diversity of influenza A viruses and their capability to successfully infect an array of hosts, including avian and mammalian species, are highlighted in a discussion about host range and evolution."
8034,The importance of viral receptor-binding hemagglutinins and host sialic acid distribution in species-restricted binding of viruses is underscored.
8035,"Finally, recent advances in our understanding of the seasonality and transmission of influenza viruses are described, and their importance for the control of the spread of these viruses is discussed."
8036,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), also known as avian pneumovirus or turkey rhinotracheitis virus, is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and is associated with swollen head syndrome in chickens."
8037,"Since its discovery in the 1970s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide."
8038,The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2′-O positions.
8039,"In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein."
8040,"These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2′-O, but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys."
8041,"Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPV Minnesota strain."
8042,"Collectively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2′-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses."
8043,"IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses include many economically and agriculturally important viruses such as avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), human pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus type 3, and measles virus, and highly lethal emerging pathogens such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus."
8044,"For many of them, there is no effective vaccine or antiviral drug."
8045,These viruses share common strategies for viral gene expression and replication.
8046,"During transcription, paramyxoviruses produce capped, methylated, and polyadenylated mRNAs."
8047,"Using aMPV as a model, we found that viral ribose 2′-O methyltransferase (MTase) is a novel approach to rationally attenuate the virus for vaccine purpose."
8048,Recombinant aMPV (raMPV) lacking 2′-O MTase were not only highly attenuated in turkeys but also provided complete protection against the challenge of homologous and heterologous aMPV strains.
8049,This novel approach can be applicable to other animal and human paramyxoviruses for rationally designing live attenuated vaccines.
8050, Agent-based models have been employed to describe numerous processes in immunology.
8051,Simulations based on these types of models have been used to enhance our understanding of immunology and disease pathology.
8052,We review various agent-based models relevant to host–pathogen systems and discuss their contributions to our understanding of biological processes.
8053,We then point out some limitations and challenges of agent-based models and encourage efforts towards reproducibility and model validation.
8054,"Although a highly effective vaccine is available, the number of yellow fever cases has increased over the past 2 decades, which highlights the pressing need for antiviral therapeutics."
8055,"In a high-throughput screening campaign, we identified an acetic acid benzodiazepine (BDAA) compound which potently inhibits yellow fever virus (YFV)."
8056,"Interestingly, while treatment of YFV-infected cultures with 2 μM BDAA reduced the virion production by greater than 2 logs, the compound was not active against 21 other viruses from 14 different viral families."
8057,"Selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that replacement of the proline at amino acid 219 (P219) of the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) with serine, threonine, or alanine conferred YFV with resistance to BDAA without apparent loss of replication fitness in cultured mammalian cells."
8058,"However, replacement of P219 with glycine conferred BDAA resistance with significant loss of replication ability."
8059,"Bioinformatics analysis predicts that the P219 amino acid is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum lumen side of the fifth putative transmembrane domain of NS4B, and the mutation may render the viral protein incapable of interacting with BDAA."
8060,Our studies thus revealed an important role and the structural basis for the NS4B protein in supporting YFV replication.
8061,"Moreover, in YFV-infected hamsters, oral administration of BDAA protected 90% of the animals from death, significantly reduced viral load by greater than 2 logs, and attenuated virus infection-induced liver injury and body weight loss."
8062,The encouraging preclinical results thus warrant further development of BDAA or its derivatives as antiviral agents to treat yellow fever.
8063,IMPORTANCE Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease which threatens approximately 1 billion people living in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America.
8064,"Although a highly effective yellow fever vaccine has been available for more than 7 decades, the low vaccination rate fails to prevent outbreaks in at-risk regions."
8065,"It has been estimated that up to 1.7 million YFV infections occur in Africa each year, resulting in 29,000 to 60,000 deaths."
8066,"Thus far, there is no specific antiviral treatment for yellow fever."
8067,"To cope with this medical challenge, we identified a benzodiazepine compound that selectively inhibits YFV by targeting the viral NS4B protein."
8068,"To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating in vivo safety and antiviral efficacy of a YFV NS4B inhibitor in an animal model."
8069,We have thus reached a critical milestone toward the development of specific antiviral therapeutics for clinical management of yellow fever.
8070,": Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious and acute viral disease, which has caused high mortality rates in birds and considerable economic losses in different parts of the world for more than two decades and it still represents a considerable threat to poultry."
8071,The current study was designed to rigorously measure the reliability of a phylogenetic marker included into segment B.
8072,"This marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies, incorporating this segment of the viral genome, to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus (vvIBDV) strains worldwide."
8073,METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequences of the segment B gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank Database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work.
8074,"A phylogenetic marker named B-marker was assessed by different phylogenetic principles such as saturation of substitution, phylogenetic noise and high consistency."
8075,This last parameter is based on the ability of B-marker to reconstruct the same topology as the complete segment B of the viral genome.
8076,"From the results obtained from B-marker, demographic history for both main lineages of IBDV regarding segment B was performed by Bayesian skyline plot analysis."
8077,"Phylogenetic analysis for both segments of IBDV genome was also performed, revealing the presence of a natural reassortant strain with segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains within Cuban IBDV population."
8078,"CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of vvIBDV strains, describing molecular epidemiology of IBDV using the state-of-the-art methodology concerning phylogenetic reconstruction."
8079,This study also revealed the presence of a novel natural reassorted strain as possible manifest of change in the genetic structure and stability of the vvIBDV strains.
8080,"Therefore, it highlights the need to obtain information about both genome segments of IBDV for molecular epidemiology studies."
8081,Characterized animal models are needed for studying the pathogenesis of and evaluating medical countermeasures for persisting Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections.
8082,"Here, we further characterized a lethal transgenic mouse model of MERS-CoV infection and disease that globally expresses human CD26 (hCD26)/DPP4."
8083,"The 50% infectious dose (ID(50)) and lethal dose (LD(50)) of virus were estimated to be <1 and 10 TCID(50) of MERS-CoV, respectively."
8084,"Neutralizing antibody developed in the surviving mice from the ID(50)/LD(50) determinations, and all were fully immune to challenge with 100 LD(50) of MERS-CoV."
8085,The tissue distribution and histopathology in mice challenged with a potential working dose of 10 LD(50) of MERS-CoV were subsequently evaluated.
8086,"In contrast to the overwhelming infection seen in the mice challenged with 10(5) LD(50) of MERS-CoV, we were able to recover infectious virus from these mice only infrequently, although quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) tests indicated early and persistent lung infection and delayed occurrence of brain infection."
8087,"Persistent inflammatory infiltrates were seen in the lungs and brain stems at day 2 and day 6 after infection, respectively."
8088,"While focal infiltrates were also noted in the liver, definite pathology was not seen in other tissues."
8089,"Finally, using a receptor binding domain protein vaccine and a MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor, we demonstrated the value of this model for evaluating vaccines and antivirals against MERS."
8090,"As outcomes of MERS-CoV infection in patients differ greatly, ranging from asymptomatic to overwhelming disease and death, having available both an infection model and a lethal model makes this transgenic mouse model relevant for advancing MERS research."
8091,IMPORTANCE Fully characterized animal models are essential for studying pathogenesis and for preclinical screening of vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection and disease.
8092,"When given a high dose of MERS-CoV, our transgenic mice expressing hCD26/DPP4 viral receptor uniformly succumbed to death within 6 days, making it difficult to evaluate host responses to infection and disease."
8093,We further characterized this model by determining both the ID(50) and the LD(50) of MERS-CoV in order to establish both an infection model and a lethal model for MERS and followed this by investigating the antibody responses and immunity of the mice that survived MERS-CoV infection.
8094,"Using the estimated LD(50) and ID(50) data, we dissected the kinetics of viral tissue distribution and pathology in mice challenged with 10 LD(50) of virus and utilized the model for preclinical evaluation of a vaccine and drug for treatment of MERS-CoV infection."
8095,This further-characterized transgenic mouse model will be useful for advancing MERS research.
8096,: In Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemic areas placental malaria (PM) is an important complication of malaria.
8097,The recurrence of malaria in primigravidae women irrespective of acquired protection during childhood is caused by the interaction between the parasite-expressed VAR2CSA antigen and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space and lack of protective antibodies.
8098,PM impairs fetal development mainly by excessive inflammation processes.
8099,After infections during pregnancy women acquire immunity to PM conferred by antibodies against VAR2CSA.
8100,"Ideally, a vaccine against PM will induce antibody-mediated immune responses that block the adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IE) in the placenta."
8101,PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have previously shown that antibodies raised in rat against individual domains of VAR2CSA can block IE binding to CSA.
8102,"In this study we have immunized mice, rats and rabbits with each individual domain and the full-length protein corresponding to the FCR3 VAR2CSA variant."
8103,We found there is an inherently higher immunogenicity of C-terminal domains compared to N-terminally located domains.
8104,This was irrespective of whether antibodies were induced against single domains or the full-length protein.
8105,"Species-specific antibody responses were also found, these were mainly directed against single domains and not the full-length VAR2CSA protein."
8106,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Binding inhibitory antibodies appeared to be against conformational B-cell epitopes.
8107,Non-binding inhibitory antibodies reacted highly against the C-terminal end of the VAR2CSA molecule especially the highly polymorphic DBL6ε domain.
8108,Differential species-specific induction of antibody responses may allow for more direct analysis of functional versus non-functional B-cell epitopes.
8109,Infectious diseases still remain one of the biggest challenges for human health.
8110,"In order to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and develop effective diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, and preventive vaccines, a suitable animal model which can represent the characteristics of infectious is required."
8111,"The Syrian hamster immune responses to infectious pathogens are similar to humans and as such, this model is advantageous for studying pathogenesis of infection including post-bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens, along with assessing the efficacy and interactions of medications and vaccines for those pathogens."
8112,"This review summarizes the current status of Syrian hamster models and their use for understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen infection, in addition to their use as a drug discovery platform and provides a strong rationale for the selection of Syrian hamster as animal models in biomedical research."
8113,The challenges of using Syrian hamster as an alternative animal model for the research of infectious diseases are also addressed.
8114,Efforts to develop a broadly protective vaccine against the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus have focused on highly conserved influenza gene products.
8115,The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and ion channel matrix protein (M2) are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza A subtypes.
8116,"Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus."
8117,"In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA."
8118,"However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased."
8119,"To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2."
8120,Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge.
8121,"Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets."
8122,"These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge."
8123,Human metapneumovirus is a recently recognized pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children as well as elderly and immunocompromised adults.
8124,"The virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, sub family Pneumovirinae and genus Metapneumovirus."
8125,Through genetic analysis it has been characterized into two groups A and B which are further divided into four sub-lineages.
8126,The virus is difficult to grow in tissue culture and hence reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for N and L gene is the method of choice for diagnosis.
8127,The virus has been seen in all countries with seasonal distribution in winter months for temperate and spring/summer for tropical countries.
8128,F gene is the most conserved among different lineages and efforts are underway to design recombination vaccine using F gene.
8129,"ABSTRACT Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which has created panic in Asia and in some parts of North America, is the first epidemic of the new century."
8130,"Although it has been well-contained, sporadic cases continue to emerge."
8131,"Objectives The authors trace the emergence of the SARS outbreak from southern China and its spread worldwide, discuss the viral etiology of the infection and its clinical features, and review the infection control guidelines issued during the outbreak by the health authorities in Hong Kong, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the American Dental Association."
8132,They also review the prospects for a new outbreak and preventive measures.
8133,"Overview The disease, which is caused by a novel coronavirus termed the “SARS coronavirus,” or SARS-CoV, essentially spreads through droplet infection and affects people of any age."
8134,It has a mortality rate ranging from 10 to 15 percent.
8135,"A major hallmark of this disease has been the rate at which it has affected health care workers through nosocomial transmission; in some countries, up to one-fourth to one-third of those infected were in this category."
8136,"However, no dental health care worker has been affected by SARS in a nosocomial or dental setting."
8137,"Conclusions and Clinical Implications Researchers believe that a combination of factors, including the universal infection control measures that the dental community has implemented and/or the low degree of viral shedding in the prodromal phase of SARS, may have obviated the spread of the disease in dental settings."
8138,The dental community should reflect on this outbreak to reinforce the currently applied infection control measures.
8139,: Bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV3) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are the cause of respiratory disease in cattle worldwide.
8140,"With other pathogens, they cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in ruminants."
8141,The aim of the study was the detection and molecular characterisation of BPIV3 and BRSV from nasal swabs and lung samples of cows in and around the Erzurum region of eastern Turkey.
8142,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 155 samples were collected."
8143,Of animals used in the study 92 were males and 63 females.
8144,"The age of the animals was between 9 months and 5 years, mean 1.4 years."
8145,Most males were in the fattening period and being raised in open sheds; females were in the lactating period and kept in free stall barns.
8146,All samples were tested for the presence of viral genes using RT-PCR.
8147,Gene-specific primers in a molecular method (RT-PCR) identified BRSV (fusion gene) and BPIV3 (matrix gene) strains at the genus level.
8148,"RESULTS: RNA from BRSV and BPIV3 was detected in two (1.29%) and three (1.93%) samples, respectively, one of each of which was sequenced and the sequences were aligned with reference virus strains."
8149,Phylogenetic analyses clustered the strains in genotype C/BPIV3 and subgroup III/BRSV.
8150,CONCLUSION: The results indicate that BRSV and BPIV3 contribute to bovine respiratory disease cases in Turkey.
8151,This is the first report on their detection and molecular characterisation in ruminants in Turkey.
8152,"As concerns increase about adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) being a safe gene transfer vector, it is important to evaluate its distribution, residence time, and possible toxicity in immunodeficient populations."
8153,"To characterize the potential risk associated with different Ad5 vector delivery modes, we used immunocompetent and immunodeficient Rag2 (−/−) animals to establish mouse and rat models that could be monitored with bioluminescent imaging following intramuscular or intravascular infection with an engineered replication-incompetent Ad5 virus carrying the firefly luciferase gene (Ad5-Fluc)."
8154,"The Ad5 vector was less well-tolerated by Rag2 (−/−) animals than by wildtype ones, with delayed residence time, wider virus dissemination, less weight gain, and relatively severe pathological changes."
8155,"In intravascularly Ad5-Fluc-infected Rag2 (−/−) mice, systemic virus dissemination extended from the abdomen to the limbs and head on day 9 post-infection."
8156,"Additionally, significant increases in plasma TNF-α and IFN-γ, which may be important factors in the heightened immunopathology in the liver and brain, were detected in the Rag2 (−/−) mice 30 days after intravascular delivery."
8157,The Ad5 vector was better tolerated after intramuscular delivery than after intravascular delivery.
8158,Ad5-Fluc/Rag2 (−/−) mice and rats can be used as reliable models of an immunodeficient population in which to evaluate the safety of Ad5-vectored vaccines or gene therapy products.
8159,"Non-human primates, primarily macaques, have been used to study tuberculosis for decades."
8160,"However, in the last 15 years, this model has been refined substantially to allow careful investigations of the immune response and host-pathogen interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection."
8161,"Low dose challenge with fully virulent strains in cynomolgus macaques result in the full clinical spectrum seen in humans, including latent and active infection."
8162,"Reagents from humans are usually cross-reactive with macaques, further facilitating the use of this model system to study tuberculosis."
8163,"Finally, macaques develop the spectrum of granuloma types seen in humans, providing a unique opportunity to investigate bacterial and host factors at the local (lung and lymph node) level."
8164,Here we review the past decade of immunology and pathology studies in macaque models of tuberculosis.
8165,The ability of fd bacteriophage particles to trigger different arms of the immune system has been previously shown by us with particular emphasis on the ability of phages to raise CTL responses in vitro and in vivo.
8166,Here we show that fd virions in the absence of adjuvants are able to evoke a DTH reaction mediated by antigen specific CD8+ T cells.
8167,"In addition, we analyzed the induction of CTL responses in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells, and we observed that short-term secondary CTL responses were induced in the absence of CD4+ T cells while induction of long-term memory CTLs required the presence of CD4+ T lymphocytes."
8168,These results examine the cellular mechanism at the basis of fd efficiency and provide new elements to further validate the use of fd particles for eliciting and monitoring antigen-specific CTLs.
8169," Immunisation by administration of antibodies (immunoglobulins) has been known for more than one hundred years as a very efficient means of obtaining immediate, short-lived protection against infection and/or against the disease-causing effects of toxins from microbial pathogens and from other sources."
8170,"Thus, due to its rapid action, passive immunisation is often used to treat disease caused by infection and/or toxin exposure."
8171,"However immunoglobulins may also be administered prior to exposure to infection and/or toxin, although they will not provide long-lasting protection as is seen with active immunisation (vaccination) in which an immunological memory is established by controlled exposure of the host to the pathogen in question."
8172,"With multi-factorial infectious diseases in production animals, especially those that have proven hard to control by vaccination, the potential of passive immunisation remains big."
8173,"This review highlights a number of examples on the use of passive immunisation for the control of infectious disease in the modern production of a range of animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, goat, poultry and fish."
8174,"Special emphasis is given on the enablement of passive immunisation strategies in these production systems through low cost and ease of use as well as on the sources, composition and purity of immunoglobulin preparations used and their benefits as compared to current measures, including vaccination (also comprising maternal vaccination), antibiotics and feed additives such as spray-dried plasma."
8175,"It is concluded that provided highly efficient, relatively low-price immunoglobulin products are available, passive immunisation has a clear role in the modern animal production sector as a means of controlling infectious diseases, importantly with a very low risk of causing development of bacterial resistance, thus constituting a real and widely applicable alternative to antibiotics."
8176,Influenza and respiratory viruses have a global impact on public health.
8177,Clinical virology laboratories and laboratorians play an important role in not only the diagnosis but also the surveillance of these pathogens.
8178,"Surveillance for influenza and other respiratory pathogens is important, as it informs public health decision making in terms of influenza vaccine and antiviral effectiveness, informs clinicians and public health practitioners about the pathogenicity of specific viral strains, guides clinical practice, and supports laboratory panning activities."
8179,"Key background issues include the following: the fact that the laboratory is only one of several data providers to a surveillance system, the biologic nature of influenza and respiratory viruses and the laboratory needs to keep up to date on the diagnosis of these agents, the need for laboratorians to be involved in case definition development, the impact of push and pull data flow models on laboratory resources, and the fact that laboratories may be asked to provide more than just test results to surveillance programs."
8180,"This review also identifies some key issues or questions that arise during the pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic phases that could impact on the ability of the laboratory to link to surveillance programs."
8181,"Finally, issues surrounding virus characterization programs and how they link to surveillance programs are identified and discussed."
8182,"Recently, it has been demonstrated that plants offer the possibility of producing low cost subunit vaccines that can be either parenterally or orally administered."
8183,Here we review data we obtained on the immunological response elicited by two recombinant versions of the glycoprotein S from the swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) expressed in transgenic plants.
8184,"Arabidopsis or potato plants were genetically transformed with cDNAs constructs encoding the N-terminal domain (aa residues 1–750) or the full-length glycoprotein S of TGEV, responsible for the neutralizing antibody induction against the virus, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter."
8185,Genomic DNA and mRNA analysis of leave extracts from transformed plants demonstrated the incorporation of the foreign cDNA into the plant genomes as well as their transcription.
8186,Expression of recombinant polypeptides was observed in most transgenic plants by ELISA using specific antibodies.
8187,"Mice immunized either parenterally with leave extracts from transgenic arabidopsis plants or, more interestingly, fed with potato tubers, developed antibodies that specifically reacted with TGEV in ELISA, immunoprecipitated the glycoprotein S and in some cases neutralized the virus infectivity."
8188,"From the above results, we conclude that transgenic plants expressing glycoprotein S polypeptides may be potentially used as a source of recombinant antigen for vaccine production."
8189, The immunological characteristics of SARS-CoV spike protein were investigated by administering mice with plasmids encoding various S gene fragments.
8190,"We showed that the secreting forms of S1, S2 subunits and the N-terminus of S1 subunit (residues 18–495) were capable of eliciting SARS-CoV specific antibodies and the region immediate to N-terminus of matured S1 protein contained an important immunogenic determinant for elicitation of SARS-CoV specific antibodies."
8191,"In addition, mice immunized with plasmids encoding S1 fragment developed a Th1-mediated antibody isotype switching."
8192,"Another interesting finding was that mouse antibodies elicited separately by plasmids encoding S1 and S2 subunits cooperatively neutralized SARS-CoV but neither the S1 nor S2 specific antibodies did, suggesting the possible role of both S1 and S2 subunits in host cell docking and entry."
8193,These results provide insights into understanding the immunological characteristics of spike protein and the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV.
8194,"ABSTRACT Neonatal diarrhea remains the primary cause of mortality in dairy calves around the world, and optimal treatment protocols are needed."
8195,"The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support."
8196,Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy.
8197,"In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids."
8198,"Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea."
8199,Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial.
8200,Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer.
8201,"In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly."
8202,"Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals."
8203,Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%.
8204,"Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L)."
8205,"Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment."
8206,"All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group."
8207,"In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution."
8208,Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.
8209,: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continues to be great challenge in calf rearing units.
8210,The urgent need to decrease the use of antibiotics and increase animal welfare in beef production has forced us to introduce new preventive methods.
8211,"Vaccinations could contribute to the solution, but the high incidence of BRD already at an early age has made it difficult to introduce suitable vaccination programs."
8212,"Challenge studies have shown promising results in 3–14 day old calves vaccinated with intranasal BRD vaccine, but very few field trials are available to assess the efficacy of the intranasal vaccines in field conditions."
8213,"We evaluated the effect of one dose of commercial intranasal vaccination on calf mortality, daily gain, and treatment incidence for BRD in one calf rearing unit."
8214,"In total, 497 calves (mean age 19 days) were included in our study, 247 of which were vaccinated at the time of arrival to the unit and 250 served as negative controls (unvaccinated)."
8215,Vaccinated and unvaccinated calves were situated in separate compartments until weaning.
8216,"Daily gain, treatment incidence, and mortality were recorded until the calves were transported to the finishing unit, which averaged 154.5 days from arrival."
8217,RESULTS: Average daily gain over the complete study period was 1151.9 g/day (SD 137.9) for the vaccinated calves and 1139.5 g/day (SD 135.9) for the unvaccinated calves.
8218,Intranasal vaccination combined with older arrival age (17 days or older) resulted in a higher daily gain (47.8 g/day) compared with unvaccinated calves (coef.
8219,"0.0478, p = 0.003)."
8220,This association was not recorded in calves that were younger than 17 days upon arrival.
8221,"Intranasal vaccination was not significantly associated either with mortality (OR 0.976, p = 0.968) or treatment incidence for BRD (OR 1.341, p = 0.120)."
8222,"In total, six vaccinated calves (2.43%) and six unvaccinated calves (2.40%) died during the study period."
8223,"CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating arriving calves with intranasal vaccine in the calf rearing unit did not decrease the mortality or treatment incidence for BRD, but it significantly improved the weight gain in calves transported to the unit at the age of 17 days or older."
8224," Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of Filoviridae virus family under the genus Ebolavirus, has emerged as a dangerous and potential threat to human health globally."
8225,"It causes a severe and deadly hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, called Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)."
8226,"In recent outbreaks of EVD, there has been loss of large numbers of individual’s life."
8227,"Therefore, EBOV has attracted researchers and increased interests in developing new models for virus evolution, and therapies."
8228,The EBOV interacts with the immune system of the host which led to understand how the virus functions and effects immune system behaviour.
8229,"This article presents an exhaustive review on Ebola research which includes EVD illness, symptoms, transmission patterns, patho-physiology conditions, development of antiviral agents and vaccines, resilient health system, dynamics and mathematical model of EBOV, challenges and prospects for future studies."
8230,Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility; however the low titer of these viruses substantially limits their wider applications.
8231,We developed a highly efficient pseudovirus production system capable of yielding 100 times more rabies pseudovirus than the traditional method.
8232,"Employing the high-titer pseudoviruses, we have developed robust in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays for the evaluation of rabies vaccine, which traditionally relies on live-virus based assays."
8233,"Compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility."
8234,"Moreover, the in vivo PBNA assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay."
8235,"Following intravenous administration, the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice, with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen, liver and brain."
8236,"Furthermore, data from in vivo PBNA showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days."
8237,"Taken together, the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel PBNA assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety, rapidity, reproducibility and high throughput capacity."
8238, Heifer calf management practices and clinical outcomes were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983.
8239,"Data were collected at both the farm level (all farms) and the individual calf level (1968 calves, 35 farms)."
8240,Farm-level management data were collected by means of questionnaires and farm visits.
8241,Calf-level management data were recorded by farmers on forms provided.
8242,"Treatments for disease and mortality data were recorded by the farmers on the calves up to the age of weaning, the age at which calves were no longer fed milk or milk substitutes on a regular basis."
8243,Farm size ranged from 23 to 154 calvings per year.
8244,"Farm-level mortality rates per six-month season (winter/summer) were skewed, with a mean of about 6%, a median of zero, and a range of 67%."
8245,Morbidity rates were similarly skewed.
8246,"Four percent of liveborn heifer calves died, 20% were treated for scours, and 15% were treated for pneumonia before the age of weaning."
8247,"Stated farm policies on calf rearing were implemented to varying degrees on different farms, as estimated from individual calf data."
8248,"This posed particular problems for interpreting farm-level data, since the danger of committing an ecologic fallacy was high."
8249,The data set described in this paper formed the basis for an observational study of the interlationships of heifer calf management and clinical outcomes.
8250,"In a previous study, we demonstrated that oral immunization using Autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the Gal-lectin LC3 fragment (AcNPV-LC3) of Entamoeba histolytica conferred protection against ALA development in hamsters."
8251,"In this study, we determined the ability of AcNPV-LC3 to protect against ALA by the intramuscular route as well as the liver immune response associated with protection."
8252,"Results showed that 55% of hamsters IM immunized with AcNPV-LC3 showed sterile protection against ALA, whereas other 20% showed reduction in the size and extent of abscesses, resulting in some protection in 75% of animals compared to the sham control group."
8253,"Levels of protection showed a linear correlation with the development and intensity of specific antiamoeba cellular and humoral responses, evaluated in serum and spleen of hamsters, respectively."
8254,Evaluation of the Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns expressed in the liver of hamsters showed that sterile protection was associated with the production of high levels of IFNγ and IL-4.
8255,These results suggest that the baculovirus system is equally efficient by the intramuscular as well as the oral routes for ALA protection and that the Gal-lectin LC3 fragment is a highly protective antigen against hepatic amoebiasis through the local induction of IFNγ and IL-4.
8256,Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic disease with high fatality.
8257,Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising vaccine candidate against EBOV.
8258,We recently showed that VLPs protect mice from lethal EBOV infection when given before or after viral infection.
8259,"To elucidate pathways through which VLPs confer post-exposure protection, we investigated the role of type I interferon (IFN) signaling."
8260,"We found that VLPs lead to accelerated induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver and spleen of wild type mice, but not in Ifnar(-/-) mice."
8261,"Accordingly, EBOV infected Ifnar(-/-) mice, unlike wild type mice succumbed to death even after VLP treatment."
8262,The ISGs induced in wild type mice included anti-viral proteins and negative feedback factors known to restrict viral replication and excessive inflammatory responses.
8263,"Importantly, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was much higher in WT mice without VLPs than mice treated with VLPs."
8264,"In EBOV infected Ifnar(-/-) mice, however, uninhibited viral replication and elevated proinflammatory factor expression ensued, irrespective of VLP treatment, supporting the view that type I IFN signaling helps to limit viral replication and attenuate inflammatory responses."
8265,"Further analyses showed that VLP protection requires the transcription factor, IRF8 known to amplify type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages, the probable sites of initial EBOV infection."
8266,"Together, this study indicates that VLPs afford post-exposure protection by promoting expeditious initiation of type I IFN signaling in the host."
8267,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is a polymicrobial disease, which usually occurs as a complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI)."
8268,"While respiratory viruses alone may cause viral AOM, they increase the risk of bacterial middle ear infection and worsen clinical outcomes of bacterial AOM."
8269,"URI viruses alter Eustachian tube (ET) function via decreased mucociliary action, altered mucus secretion and increased expression of inflammatory mediators among other mechanisms."
8270,Transient reduction in protective functions of the ET allows colonizing bacteria of the nasopharynx to ascend into the middle ear and cause AOM.
8271,"Advances in research help us to better understand the host responses to viral URI, the mechanisms of viral–bacterial interactions in the nasopharynx and the development of AOM."
8272,"In this review, we present current knowledge regarding viral–bacterial interactions in the pathogenesis and clinical course of AOM."
8273,We focus on the common respiratory viruses and their established role in AOM.
8274, Nutritional intervention in older dogs aims to increase lifespan and improve life quality as well as delay the development of diseases related to ageing.
8275,It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system.
8276,"However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce."
8277,This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs.
8278,Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800).
8279,"Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated."
8280,"On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays."
8281,"On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed."
8282,Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software.
8283,"Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test."
8284,"Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies."
8285,Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073).
8286,"Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093)."
8287,"Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05)."
8288,"A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT."
8289,There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs.
8290,This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.
8291,15 Pathogenic mechanisms of foodborne viral disease
8292,"Exposure to animals persistently infected (PI) with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) results in immunomodulation of cohorts that may have health and growth consequences; however, effects may differ in low-risk, preconditioned (PC) vs. high-risk, auction market (AM) beef cattle."
8293,Our objective was to compare health and performance of PC or AM management systems with (PI) or without (CON) presence of a PI-BVDV pen mate using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement.
8294,"Four shipment blocks of crossbred PC steers (n = 236) from 3 ranch-origins were weaned, dewormed, vaccinated, tested for PI-BVDV, and kept on the ranch for ≥42 d. Subsequently, PC steers were transported to a stocker receiving unit (RU), weighed (251 ± 2 kg), blood sampled, stratified by d −1 BW, and assigned randomly to treatment (PCPI or PCCON) with no additional processing."
8295,"Simultaneously, 4 blocks of crossbred AM calves (n = 292) were assembled from regional auction markets and transported to the RU ± 36 h from PC arrival."
8296,"The AM calves were weighed (245 ± 1.3 kg), stratified by gender and d −1 BW, processed under the same regimen used for PC steers at their origin ranch except bull calves were castrated, and then assigned randomly to treatment (AMPI or AMCON)."
8297,Treatment pens (0.45 ha) were arranged spatially such that PI did not have fence-line or water source contact with CON.
8298,Calves were fed identically and followed the same antibiotic treatment protocol.
8299,Daily BW gain for the entire 42-d receiving trial was greater (P < 0.001) for PC (1.2 kg) compared with AM (0.85 kg).
8300,There was an exposure effect (P = 0.002) on ADG from d 28 to 42; CON gained 1.12 kg vs. 0.90 kg BW for PI cohort.
8301,"Morbidity was markedly greater (P < 0.001) in AM (70%) vs. PC (7%), resulting in (P < 0.001) an antibiotic treatment cost of $20.52 and $2.48/animal, respectively."
8302,"Treatment with a third antibiotic occurred more often (P = 0.04) for PI cohort, and the percentage of chronically ill cattle was greatest (P = 0.06) for AMPI."
8303,"Upon arrival, BVDV type 1a, 1b, and 2a titers were greater for PC (treatment × day, P < 0.001), and the percentage seropositive to BVDV type 1a on d 0 was 100% for PC vs. 23% in AM."
8304,Platelets increased transiently (P < 0.001) with greater platelets observed in AM (P < 0.001).
8305,Results indicate that PC calves gain faster and require fewer antibiotic treatments during the receiving period.
8306,"Exposure to PI reduced BW gain from d 28 to 42, increased the number of calves treated thrice, and increased chronically ill cattle for AM."
8307," Mucosal immune responses within the middle ear and eustachian tube generally provide an effective and efficient response to the presence of microbial pathogens, with approximately 80% of clinically recognizable middle ear infections resolved within 7days."
8308,"Particularly for young children aged less than 3years of age, the proximity and direct connection of the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to the nasopharynx provide increased risk of commensal bacteria and upper respiratory tract viruses infecting the middle ear."
8309,"Mucosal immunological defense in the middle ear and eustachian tube utilizes a number of mechanisms, including physicochemical barriers of mucus and the mucosal epithelial cells and innate immune responses such as inflammation, cellular infiltration, effusion, and antimicrobial protein secretions, in addition to adaptive host immune responses."
8310,Recent advances in otopathogen recognition via microbial pattern recognition receptors and elucidation of complex signaling cascades have improved understanding of the coordination and regulation of the middle ear mucosal response.
8311,These advances support vaccine development aiming to reduce the risk of otitis media in children.
8312,Epitope-targeted HIV vaccine design seeks to focus antibody responses to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites by sequential immunization.
8313,"A chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) shares a single bnAb site, the variable loop 2 (V2)-apex, with HIV, suggesting its possible utility in an HIV immunization strategy."
8314,"Here, we generate a chimpanzee SIV Env trimer, MT145K, which displays selective binding to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and precursor versions, but no binding to other HIV specificities."
8315,We determine the structure of the MT145K trimer by cryo-EM and show that its architecture is remarkably similar to HIV Env.
8316,Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses.
8317,Subsequent boosting with an HIV trimer cocktail induces responses that exhibit some virus cross-neutralization.
8318,"Overall, the chimpanzee MT145K trimer behaves as expected from design both in vitro and in vivo and is an attractive potential component of a sequential immunization regimen to induce V2-apex bnAbs."
8319,Engaging the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) for killing of virus-infected cells and secretion of antiviral cytokines and chemokines was incorporated as one of the important features in the design of universal influenza vaccines.
8320,"However, investigation of the ADCC epitopes on the highly immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin (HA) head region has been rarely reported."
8321,"In this study, we determined the ADCC and antiviral activities of two putative ADCC epitopes, designated E1 and E2, on the HA head of a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in vitro and in a lethal mouse model."
8322,Our data demonstrated that sera from the E1-vaccinated mice could induce high ADCC activities.
8323,"Importantly, the induction of ADCC response modestly decreased viral load in the lungs of H1N1-infected mice."
8324,"However, the elevated ADCC significantly increased mouse alveolar damage and mortality than that of the PBS-vaccinated group (P < 0.0001)."
8325,"The phenotype was potentially due to an exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration triggered by ADCC, as an upregulated release of cytotoxic granules (perforin) was observed in the lung tissue of E1-vaccinated mice after H1N1 influenza virus challenge."
8326,"Overall, our data suggested that ADCC elicited by certain domains of HA head region might have a detrimental rather than protective effect during influenza virus infection."
8327,"Thus, future design of universal influenza vaccine shall strike a balance between the induction of protective immunity and potential side effects of ADCC."
8328,"Over the past decade, microbiology and infectious disease research have undergone the most profound revolution since the times of Pasteur."
8329,Genomic sequencing has revealed the much-awaited blueprint of most pathogens.
8330,"Screening blood for the nucleic acids of infectious agents has blunted the spread of pathogens by transfusion, the field of antiviral therapeutics has exploded and technologies for the development of novel and safer vaccines have become available."
8331,"The quantum jump in our ability to detect, prevent and treat infectious diseases resulting from improved technologies and genomics was moderated during this period by the greatest emergence of new infectious agents ever recorded and a worrisome increase in resistance to existing therapies."
8332,Dozens of new infectious diseases are expected to emerge in the coming decades.
8333,Controlling these diseases will require a better understanding of the worldwide threat and economic burden of infectious diseases and a global agenda.
8334," As the threat of exposure to emerging and reemerging viruses within a naïve population increases, it is vital that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune response be thoroughly investigated."
8335,"Recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus, Ebola virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus illustrate the emerging threats that are encountered."
8336,"By utilizing animal models in this endeavor, the host response to viruses can be studied in a more complex and integrated context to identify novel drug targets, and assess the efficacy and safety of new products rapidly."
8337,This is especially true in the advent and implementation of the FDA animal rule.
8338,"Although no one animal model is able to recapitulate all aspects of human disease, understanding the current limitations allows for a more targeted experimental design."
8339,"Important facets to consider prior to an animal study are route of viral exposure, species of animal, biomarkers of disease, and a humane endpoint."
8340,"This chapter covers the current animal models for medically important human viruses, and demonstrates where the gaps in knowledge exist."
8341," Viral pathogenesis is a field in rapid evolution, reflecting the dynamic development of systems biology and the continuing introduction of new or improved methodologies."
8342,"Therefore, this final chapter is dedicated to “futurism,” a look at what lies ahead for this field."
8343,We have recruited a number of scientists to write short pieces where they are free to speculate on future developments in their respective areas of expertise.
8344," Animal diseases are known to be the origin of many human diseases, and there are many examples from ancient civilizations of plagues that arose from animals, domesticated and wild."
8345,Records of attempts to control zoonoses are almost as old.
8346,The early focus on food-borne illness evolved into veterinary medicine's support of public health efforts.
8347,"Key historical events, disease outbreaks, and individuals responsible for their control are reviewed and serve as a foundation for understanding the current and future efforts in veterinary public health."
8348,Animal medicine and veterinary public health have been intertwined since humans first began ministrations to their families and animals.
8349,"In the United States, the veterinary medical profession has effectively eliminated those major problems of animal health that had serious public health ramifications."
8350,These lessons and experiences can serve as a model for other countries.
8351,Our past must also be a reminder that the battle for human and animal health is ongoing.
8352,New agents emerge to threaten human and animal populations.
8353,"With knowledge of the past, coupled with new technologies and techniques, we must be vigilant and carry on."
8354,Adaptations in maternal systemic immunity are presumed to be responsible for observed alterations in disease susceptibility and severity as pregnancy progresses.
8355,"Epidemiological evidence as well as animal studies have shown that influenza infections are more severe during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, resulting in greater morbidity and mortality, although the reason for this is still unclear."
8356,Our laboratory has taken advantage of 20 years of experience studying the murine immune response to respiratory viruses to address questions of altered immunity during pregnancy.
8357,"With clinical studies and unique animal model systems, we are working to define the mechanisms responsible for altered immune responses to influenza infection during pregnancy and what roles hormones such as estrogen or progesterone play in these alterations."
8358,"Old World frugivorous bats have been identified as natural hosts for emerging zoonotic viruses of significant public health concern, including henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra virus), Ebola virus, and Marburg virus."
8359,"Epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics, with particular attention paid to juveniles, whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes."
8360,"However, little is understood about bat immunology, including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates."
8361,"Understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations, which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans."
8362,"We conducted two separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1) canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus; and 2) Hendra virus in wild-caught, naturally infected Pteropus alecto."
8363,Both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses.
8364,"We found that in both species, antibodies were transferred from dam to pup."
8365,"In P. hypomelanus pups, titers against CDV waned over a mean period of 228.6 days (95% CI: 185.4–271.8) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 96.0 days (CI 95%: 30.7–299.7)."
8366,"In P. alecto pups, antibodies waned over 255.13 days (95% CI: 221.0–289.3) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 52.24 days (CI 95%: 33.76–80.83)."
8367,"Each species showed a duration of transferred maternal immunity of between 7.5 and 8.5 months, which was longer than has been previously estimated."
8368,These data will allow for more accurate interpretation of age-related Henipavirus serological data collected from wild pteropid bats.
8369,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused fatal infections, some through hospital-acquired transmission, in affected regions since its emergence in 2012."
8370,"Although the virus is not pandemic among humans, it poses a great threat to public health due to its zoonotic origin."
8371,"Thus, both preventative and therapeutic countermeasures are urgently needed."
8372,"In this study, we discovered a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MERS-CoV, which mapped to a wide range of regions on the spike (S) protein of the virus."
8373,"In addition to mAbs with neutralizing epitopes located on the receptor-binding domain, one mAb, 5F9, which binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit, showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.2 μg/mL."
8374,"We concluded that a novel neutralizing epitope for MERS-CoV also resides on the NTD of the S protein, indicating that the NTD might be important during the viral infection process."
8375,Our findings have significant implications for further vaccine design and for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal immunotherapies against MERS-CoV infection.
8376,The world was shocked in early 2003 when a pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was imminent.
8377,"The outbreak of this novel disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (the SARS-coronavirus), hit hardest in the Asian Pacific region, though eventually it spread to five continents."
8378,The speed of the spread of the SARS epidemic was unprecedented due to the highly efficient intercontinental transportation.
8379,An international collaborative effort through the World Health Organization (WHO) has helped to identify the aetiological agent about 1 month after the onset of the epidemic.
8380,The power of molecular biology and bioinformatics has enabled the complete decoding of the viral genome within weeks.
8381,"Over 1000 publications on the phylogeny, epidemiology, genomics, laboratory diagnostics, antiviral, immunization, pathogenesis, clinical disease, and management accumulated within just 1 year."
8382,"Although the exact animal reservoir of virus and how it evolved into a human pathogen are still obscure, accurate diagnosis and epidemiological control of the disease are now possible."
8383,This article reviews what is currently known about the virus and the disease.
8384,"The uneven standards of surveillance, human- or animal-based, for zoonotic diseases or pathogens maintained and transmitted by wildlife H R s, or even domestic species, is a global problem, readily apparent even within the United States, where investment in public health, including surveillance systems, has a long and enviable history."
8385,"As of 2006, there appears to be little scientific, social, or political consensus that animalbased surveillance for zoonoses merits investment in international infrastructure, other than the fledgling efforts with avian influenza, or targeted nontraditional avenues of surveillance and research."
8386,": Salmonellosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal calves, often occurring before preventative vaccines can be administered."
8387,HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect on calves of colostrum from cows vaccinated with a commercially available Salmonella Newport bacterin against a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge.
8388,ANIMALS: Twenty Holstein bull calves from a university dairy farm.
8389,METHODS: Nonrandomized placebo‐controlled trial in which colostrum was harvested from 30 cows that received 2 doses of either Salmonella bacterin or saline before calving.
8390,Colostrum collected from each group was pooled and fed to 2 groups of 10 calves at birth.
8391,"At approximately 2 weeks of age, calves were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium."
8392,"Clinical, hematologic, microbiological, and postmortem findings were compared between the 2 groups."
8393,"RESULTS: No differences in mortality, clinical findings, hematology results, blood and fecal cultures, or necropsy findings between the 2 groups were observed."
8394,"Vaccinated cows had higher colostral titers, and calves fed this colostrum had higher serum titers (mean difference, 0.429; mean [SE], 0.852 [0.02] for vaccinated versus 0.423 [0.02] for control calves)."
8395,"CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Transfer of colostral immunoglobulins from Salmonella enterica serotype Newport bacterin to neonatal calves was not sufficient to decrease mortality, clinical signs, sepsis, intestinal damage, or fecal shedding when exposed to a highly pathogenic Salmonella isolate."
8396,A large‐scale randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this bacterin when administered in the dry period for prevention of salmonellosis in neonatal calves.
8397,Previous studies of HIV-1 p55Gag immunization of mice have demonstrated the usefulness of targeting antigens to the cellular compartment containing the major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) complex molecules by use of a DNA antigen formulation encoding Gag as a chimera with the mouse lysosome-associated membrane protein (mLAMP/gag).
8398,"In the present study, we have analyzed the magnitude and breadth of Gag-specific T-lymphocyte and antibody responses elicited in Rhesus macaques after immunization with DNA encoding a human LAMP/gag (hLAMP/gag) chimera."
8399,ELISPOT analyses indicated that the average Gag-specific IFN-γ response elicited by the hLAMP/gag chimera was detectable after only two or three naked DNA immunizations in all five immunized macaques and reached an average of 1000 spot-forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMCs.
8400,"High IFN-γ ELISPOT responses were detected in CD8(+)-depleted cells, indicating that CD4(+) T-cells play a major role in these responses."
8401,"The T-cell responses of four of the macaques were also tested by use of ELISPOT to 12 overlapping 15-amino acids (aa) peptide pools containing ten peptides each, encompassing the complete Gag protein sequence."
8402,"The two Mamu 08 immunized macaques responded to eight and twelve of the pools, the Mamu B01 to six, and the other macaque to five pools indicating that the hLAMP/gag DNA antigen formulation elicits a broad T-cell response against Gag."
8403,"Additionally, there was a strong HIV-1-specific IgG response."
8404,"The IgG antibody titers increased after each DNA injection, indicating a strong amnestic B-cell response, and were highly elevated in all the macaques after three immunizations."
8405,"Moreover, the serum of each macaque recognized 13 of the 49 peptides of a 20-aa peptide library covering the complete Gag amino acid sequence."
8406,"In addition, HIV-1-specific IgA antibodies were present in the plasma and external secretions, including nasal washes."
8407,"These data support the findings of increased immunogenicity of genetic vaccines encoded as LAMP chimeras, including the response to DNA vaccines by non-human primates."
8408," This article introduces a series of invited papers in Antiviral Research marking the 10th anniversary of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus that emerged in southern China in late 2002."
8409,"Until that time, coronaviruses had not been recognized as agents causing severe disease in humans, hence, the emergence of the SARS-CoV came as a complete surprise."
8410,"Research during the past ten years has revealed the existence of a diverse pool of coronaviruses circulating among various bat species and other animals, suggesting that further introductions of highly pathogenic coronaviruses into the human population are not merely probable, but inevitable."
8411,"The recent emergence of another coronavirus causing severe disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), in humans, has made it clear that coronaviruses pose a major threat to human health, and that more research is urgently needed to elucidate their replication mechanisms, identify potential drug targets, and develop effective countermeasures."
8412,"In this series, experts in many different aspects of coronavirus replication and disease will provide authoritative, up-to-date reviews of the following topics: – clinical management and infection control of SARS; – reservoir hosts of coronaviruses; – receptor recognition and cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV; – SARS-CoV evasion of innate immune responses; – structures and functions of individual coronaviral proteins; – anti-coronavirus drug discovery and development; and – the public health legacy of the SARS outbreak."
8413,Each article will be identified in the last line of its abstract as belonging to the series “From SARS to MERS: 10years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.”
8414, Modulation of the immune system can be addressed through a variety of specific and non-specific approaches.
8415,"Many agents of synthetic and natural origin have stimulatory, suppressive or regulatory activity."
8416,There is growing evidence that drugs or biological agents capable of modulating single pathways or targets are of limited value as immune-related therapies.
8417,"Systems biology approaches are now gaining more interest compared with monovalent approaches, which can be of limited benefits with complications."
8418,This has stimulated interest in the use of ‘cocktails’ of immunodrugs to restore immunostasis.
8419,Botanicals are chemically complex and diverse and could therefore provide appropriate combinations of synergistic moieties useful in drug discovery.
8420,"Here, the importance of traditional medicine in natural product drug discovery related to immunodrugs is reviewed."
8421," The objectives of this study were to estimate the incidence of salmonellosis among a large sample of dairy herds in the northeastern United States (both at the animal level and the herd level), to describe the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the positive samples, and to determine whether various herd-level factors were important predictors of incidence."
8422,"Participating veterinarians enrolled 831 dairy herds and submitted fecal samples from 2,565 female dairy cattle for Salmonella culture because of suspicion of clinical disease."
8423,"Estimates of animal-level incidence rates were calculated for each age group as the number of cases per animal time at risk, and an estimate of herd-level incidence rate was calculated as the number of positive herds per herd time at risk."
8424,"Descriptive analysis of serotype data and level of antimicrobial resistance was performed, and Poisson regression analysis was used to study associations between the within-herd incidence of salmonellosis and certain predictor variables (herd size, housing type, vaccination status, and prior history of Salmonella infection)."
8425,Salmonella was isolated from 576 (22.5%) samples representing 93 herds.
8426,"The animal-level incidence rates for preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows were 8.1, 0.04, and 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years, respectively."
8427,The herd-level incidence rate was 8.6 positive herds per 100 herd-years.
8428,"Salmonella Newport was the predominant serotype, accounting for 41% of the cases, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium."
8429,Over 68% of all isolates were resistant to 5 or more antimicrobial agents.
8430,Herd size was the only significant predictor of the incidence of salmonellosis in a multivariable model; herds with at least 400 female dairy cattle had a higher incidence rate than smaller herds.
8431,"Our results shed light on the impact of salmonellosis on the dairy industry in the northeastern United States, and they help clarify the role of dairy cattle as a source of Salmonella serotypes that are also important human pathogens."
8432,"The respiratory tract poses a substantial challenge to the immune system due to its large surface area, an extensive vasculature that is in very close proximity to the external environment, and repeated exposure to potentially pathogenic organisms in the air."
8433,Yet many lung pathogens are controlled by appropriate immune responses.
8434,The underlying mechanisms of the adaptive cellular immune response in protecting the respiratory tract are poorly understood.
8435,"Recently, it has emerged that memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are present in the lung airways, and evidence is mounting that these cells play a key role in pulmonary immunity to pathogen challenge by immediately engaging the pathogen at the site of infection when pathogen loads are low."
8436,"For example, in the case of respiratory virus infections, there is evidence that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory cells in the lung airways mediate substantial control of a secondary respiratory virus infection in the lungs."
8437,Here we address recent developments in our understanding of lung airway memory T cells and their role in infectious disease.
8438,"Chronic hepatitis C, which is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a global health problem."
8439,"Using a mouse model of hepatitis C, we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) that encodes an HCV protein."
8440,We generated immunocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a Cre/loxP switching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains.
8441,"The HCV core protein was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acid–polycytidylic acid injection, and these mice showed chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings (hepatocyte abnormalities, accumulation of glycogen, steatosis), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma."
8442,"Immunization with one rVV strain (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C within 7 days after injection."
8443,"Furthermore, HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T-cell-dependent manner."
8444,"Consistent with these results, we showed that rVV-N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T-cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2."
8445,"We also demonstrated that the onset of chronic hepatitis in CN2-29((+/−))/MxCre((+/−)) mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF-α and (interleukin) IL-6."
8446,"Thus, our generated mice model should be useful for further investigation of the immunological processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen."
8447,"In addition, we propose that rVV-N25 could be developed as an effective therapeutic vaccine."
8448,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus.
8449,"In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms."
8450,"To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A."
8451,"The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo."
8452,"Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus."
8453,"Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP."
8454,"icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes."
8455,"However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus- or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A."
8456,"Together, these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting."
8457," The virus removal of protein A affinity chromatography, inactivation capacity, acid pH and a combination of high temperature with a chaotropic agent was determined in this work."
8458,"The model viruses studied were sendaivirus, human immunodeficency virus (HIV-IIIb), human poliovirus type-II, human herpesvirus I and canine parvovirus."
8459,"The protein A affinity chromatography showed a maximum reduction factor of 8 logs in the case of viruses larger than 120 nm size, while for small viruses (18–30 nm) the maximum reduction factor was about 5 logs."
8460,Non viral inactivation was observed during the monoclonal antibody elution step.
8461,Low pH treatment showed a maximum inactivation factor of 7.1 logs for enveloped viruses.
8462,"However, a weak inactivation factor (3.4 logs) was obtained for DNA nonenveloped viruses."
8463,The combination of high temperature with 3 M KSCN showed a high inactivation factor for all of the viruses studied.
8464,"The total clearance factor was 23.1, 15.1, 13.6, 20.0 and 16.0 logs for sendaivirus, HIV-IIIb, human poliovirus type-II, human herpesvirus I and canine parvovirus, respectively."
8465,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV).
8466,"The tissue tropism of SARS-CoV includes not only the lung, but also the gastrointestinal tract, kidney and liver."
8467,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the C-type lectin CD209L (also known L-SIGN), and DC-SIGN bind SARS-CoV, but ACE2 appears to be the key functional receptor for the virus."
8468,"There is a prominent innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection, including acute-phase proteins, chemokines, inflammatory cytokines and C-type lectins such as mannose-binding lectin, which plays a protective role against SARS."
8469,By contrast there may be a lack of type 1 interferon response.
8470,"Moreover, lymphopenia with decreased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is common during the acute phase."
8471,Convalescent patients have IgG-class neutralizing antibodies that recognize amino acids 441–700 of the spike protein (S protein) as the major epitope.
8472,"Infectious diseases of farm animals are one of the major threats to agriculture and can cause considerable damage at local, regional, and even at the international level both in industrialized and in developing countries."
8473,In the last two centuries considerable efforts have been invested in understanding the causes and pathogenesis of viral and bacterial diseases of domestic animals.
8474,"These studies have introduced new methodologies for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of veterinary diseases."
8475,"Importantly, research on veterinary pathogens also had a major impact in understanding basic biological processes of viruses and bacteria."
8476,"In some cases, studies on veterinary pathogens have revolutionized biology and established entire new disciplines."
8477,"This article will furnish a historical perspective on how studies of animal diseases, focusing on viral diseases in particular, have made a major contribution on the current understanding of pathogen biology."
8478,"In addition, the main features of some of the most important viral diseases of farm animals will be described."
8479,Climate and environmental changes can favor the emergence of new pathogens or the reemergence of old ones.
8480,It is critical that resources be devoted to research and surveillance of veterinary pathogens in order to preserve and improve both animal and human health.
8481,"Filoviruses are zoonotic and among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%."
8482,"Despite numerous efforts to identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear."
8483,The last decade has witnessed an increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology.
8484,The high mortality rates and lack of effective antiviral drugs or preventive vaccines has propagated the fear that filoviruses may become a real pandemic threat.
8485,"This article discusses the factors that could influence the possible pandemic potential of filoviruses and elaborates on the prerequisites for the containment of future outbreaks, which would help prevent the evolution of filovirus into more virulent and more transmissible viruses."
8486,Plant molecular farming is a new and promising industry involving plant biotechnology.
8487,"In this review, we describe several diverse plant systems that have been developed to produce commercially useful proteins for pharmaceutical and industrial uses."
8488,The advantages and disadvantages of each system are discussed.
8489,The first plant-derived molecular farming products have reached the marketplace and other products are poised to join them during the next few years.
8490,We explain the rationale for using plants as biofactories.
8491,"We also describe the products currently on the market, and those that appear likely to join them in the near future."
8492,"Lastly, we discuss the issue of public acceptance of molecular farming products."
8493,Zika virus (ZIKV) specific neutralizing antibodies hold great promise for antibody-based interventions and vaccine design against ZIKV infection.
8494,"However, their development in infected patients remains unclear."
8495,"Here, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to probe the dynamic development of a potent and protective ZIKV E DIII-specific antibody ZK2B10 isolated from a ZIKV convalescent individual."
8496,The unbiased repertoire analysis showed dramatic changes in the usage of antibody variable region germline genes.
8497,"However, lineage tracing of ZK2B10 revealed limited somatic hypermutation and transient expansion during the 12 months following the onset of symptoms."
8498,"The NGS-derived, germline-like ZK2B10 somatic variants neutralized ZIKV potently and protected mice from lethal challenge of ZIKV without detectable cross-reactivity with Dengue virus (DENV)."
8499,"Site-directed mutagenesis identified two residues within the λ chain, N31 and S91, that are essential to the functional maturation of ZK2B10."
8500,The repertoire and lineage features unveiled here will help elucidate the developmental process and protective potential of E DIII-directed antibodies against ZIKV infection.
8501,"Influenza A viruses have a wide host range for infection, from wild waterfowl to poultry to humans."
8502,"Recently, the cross-species transmission of avian influenza A, particularly subtype H5N1, has highlighted the importance of the non-human subtypes and their incidence in the human population has increased over the past decade."
8503,"During cross-species transmission, human disease can range from the asymptomatic to mild conjunctivitis to fulminant pneumonia and death."
8504,"With these cases, however, the risk for genetic change and development of a novel virus increases, heightening the need for public health and hospital measures."
8505,"This review discusses the epidemiology, host range, human disease, outcome, treatment, and prevention of cross-transmission of avian influenza A into humans."
8506,": Recent and previous studies have shown that guinea pigs can be infected with, and transmit, human influenza viruses."
8507,Therefore guinea pig may be a useful animal model for better understanding influenza infection and assessing vaccine strategies.
8508,"To more fully characterize the model, antibody responses following either infection/re-infection with human influenza A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 or immunization with its homologous recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein were studied."
8509,"RESULTS: Serological samples were collected and tested for anti-HA immunoglobulin by ELISA, antiviral antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and recognition of linear epitopes by peptide scanning (PepScan)."
8510,Animals inoculated with infectious virus demonstrated pronounced viral replication and subsequent serological conversion.
8511,"Animals either immunized with the homologous HA antigen or infected, showed a relatively rapid rise in antibody titers to the HA glycoprotein in ELISA assays."
8512,"Antiviral antibodies, measured by HI assay, were detectable after the second inoculation."
8513,PepScan data identified both previously recognized and newly defined linear epitopes.
8514,CONCLUSIONS: Infection and/or recombinant HA immunization of guinea pigs with H3N2 Wyoming influenza virus resulted in a relatively rapid production of viral-specific antibody thus demonstrating the strong immunogenicity of the major viral structural proteins in this animal model for influenza infection.
8515,The sensitivity of the immune response supports the utility of the guinea pig as a useful animal model of influenza infection and immunization.
8516, The H7N9 influenza virus causes high-mortality disease in humans but no effective therapeutics are available.
8517,"Here we report a human monoclonal antibody, m826, that binds to H7 hemagglutinin (HA) and protects against H7N9 infection."
8518,m826 binds to H7N9 HA with subnanomolar affinity at acidic pH and 10-fold lower affinity at neutral pH.
8519,The high-resolution (1.9 Å) crystal structure of m826 complexed with H7N9 HA indicates that m826 binds an epitope that may be fully exposed upon pH-induced conformational changes in HA.
8520,m826 fully protects mice against lethal challenge with H7N9 virus through mechanisms likely involving antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
8521,"Interestingly, immunogenetic analysis indicates that m826 is a germline antibody, and m826-like sequences can be identified in H7N9-infected patients, healthy adults, and newborn babies."
8522,"These m826 properties offer a template for H7N9 vaccine immunogens, a promising candidate therapeutic, and a tool for exploring mechanisms of virus infection inhibition by antibodies."
8523,"AIM: The resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still a threat because the causative agent remaining in animal reservoirs is not fully understood, and sporadic cases continue to be reported."
8524,Developing high titers of anti-SARS hyperimmune globulin to provide an alternative pathway for emergent future prevention and treatment of SARS.
8525,METHODS: SARS coronavirus (CoV)F69 (AY313906) and Z2-Y3 (AY394989) were isolated and identified from 2 different Cantonese onset SARS patients.
8526,Immunogen was prepared from SARS-CoV F69 strain.
8527,Six health horses were immunized 4 times and serum was collected periodically to measure the profile of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a microneutralization test.
8528,"Sera were collected in large amounts at the peak, where IgG was precipitated using ammonium sulphate and subsequently digested with pepsin."
8529,The product was then purified using anion-exchange chromatography to obtain F(ab′)(2) fragments.
8530,"RESULTS: The specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers peaked at approximately week 7 after the first immunization, with a maximum value of 1:14210."
8531,The sera collected at the peak were then purified.
8532,"Fragment of approximately 15 g F(ab′)(2) was obtained from 1 litre antiserum and the purity was above 90% with the titer of 1:5120, which could neutralize the other strain (SARS-CoV Z2-Y3) as well."
8533,"CONCLUSION: This research provides a viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of SARS coronavirus infection with equine hyperimmune globulin, with the purpose of combating any resurgence of SARS."
8534,Lack of small animal model hinders MERS coronavirus research
8535,"Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are closely related, recently emerged paramyxoviruses that are capable of causing considerable morbidity and mortality in several mammalian species, including humans."
8536,"Henipavirus-specific vaccines are still commercially unavailable, and development of novel antiviral strategies to prevent lethal infections due to henipaviruses is highly desirable."
8537,Here we describe the development of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vaccines expressing the NiV G protein.
8538,Characterization of these vaccines in mice demonstrated that a single intramuscular AAV injection was sufficient to induce a potent and long-lasting antibody response.
8539,Translational studies in hamsters further demonstrated that all vaccinated animals were protected against lethal challenge with NiV.
8540,"In addition, this vaccine induced a cross-protective immune response that was able to protect 50% of the animals against a challenge by HeV."
8541,This study presents a new efficient vaccination strategy against henipaviruses and opens novel perspectives on the use of AAV vectors as vaccines against emergent diseases.
8542, Positive-strand RNA viruses have proven to be valuable vectors for delivery and expression of antigens for direct vaccination of animals and vaccine production in plants.
8543,"However, optimal use of these viruses as vectors for vaccine and other purposes is limited by incomplete understanding of their replication pathways and associated constraints on inserted foreign genes."
8544,"Further insights into RNA virus vector design and optimization are emerging from recent advances on the function of viral RNA replication factors, the nature of the viral RNA replication complex as a membrane-bounded compartment sequestering replication components from competing processes and host defenses, and identification of surprisingly diverse host genes contributing to many virus replication steps."
8545,  This chapter discusses the virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) and DNA vaccines.
8546,"Mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as headache and drowsiness, can result from systemically elevated cytokine levels and therefore are common in many virus infections, even in the absence of the infection of the CNS."
8547,"CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread."
8548,"The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named."
8549,"DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons."
8550,DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge.
8551,"In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge."
8552,Several virus-induced CNS diseases may be explained by their triggering of autoimmunity.
8553,Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a well-characterized CNS disease induced by the administration of certain CNS proteins.
8554,ABSTRACT The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine how management practices on California dairies may be associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in preweaned calves.
8555,"A convenience sample of 100 dairies throughout California, providing a study population of 4,636 calves, were visited between May 2014 and April 2016."
8556,"During each farm visit, in-person interviews with the herd manager or calf caretaker were conducted to collect information about herd demographics, maternity pen, colostrum and calf management, herd vaccinations, and dust abatement."
8557,A random sample of preweaned calves was identified and evaluated for the presence of BRD using a standardized tool.
8558,A survey-adjusted generalized linear mixed model with a logit link function was fitted with calf as the unit of analysis and dairy as the random effect.
8559,"Mean study herd size (±SE) was 1,718 (±189.9) cows."
8560,"Survey-adjusted estimates of breed types in the sample were 81.6% (±0.6) Holstein, 13.1% (±0.4) Jersey, and 5.3% (±0.5) crossbred or other purebred breeds, and calf sex proportions were 73.8% (±1.0) female and 26.2% (±1.0) male."
8561,Overall survey-adjusted BRD prevalence in the study herds was 6.91% (±0.69).
8562,"Housing factors positively associated with BRD were metal hutches compared with wood hutches [odds ratio (OR) = 11.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.80–44.78], calf-to-calf contact in calves >75 d of age (OR = 9.95, 95% CI = 1.50–65.86), feeding Holstein calves <2.84 L of milk or replacer per day (OR = 7.16, 95% CI = 1.23–41.68), and lagoon water used for flushing manure under hutches compared with no flush (OR = 12.06, 95% CI = 1.93–75.47)."
8563,"Providing extra shade over hutches (OR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.02–0.37), feeding calves at least 90% saleable milk (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.13–0.54) or pasteurized milk (OR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.03–0.36), and feeding >5.68 L of milk or replacer per day to Jersey calves (OR = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01–0.28) were negatively associated with BRD."
8564,"Our study identified management practices on California dairies with variability and that may contribute to differences in BRD prevalence, which will be incorporated into a risk-assessment tool to control and prevent BRD in preweaned dairy calves."
8565,"The lymphatic endothelium (LE) serves as a conduit for transport of immune cells and soluble antigens from peripheral tissues to draining lymph nodes (LNs), contributing to development of host immune responses and possibly dissemination of microbes."
8566,Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are major constituents of the lymphatic endothelium.
8567,"These specialized cells could play important roles in initiation of host innate immune responses through sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs)."
8568,LECs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to create local inflammatory conditions for recruitment of naïve antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) to sites of infection and/or vaccine administration.
8569,"In this study, we examined the innate immune potential of primary LEC populations derived from multiple tissues of an animal model for human infectious diseases -- the ferret."
8570,"We generated a total of six primary LEC populations from lung, tracheal, and mesenteric LN tissues from three different ferrets."
8571,Standard RT-PCR characterization of these primary LECs showed that they varied in their expression of LEC markers.
8572,"The ferret LECs were examined for their ability to respond to poly I:C (TLR3 and RIG-1 ligand) and other known TLR ligands as measured by production of proinflammatory cytokine (IFNα, IL6, IL10, Mx1, and TNFα) and chemokine (CCL5, CCL20, and CXCL10) mRNAs using real time RT-PCR."
8573,Poly I:C exposure induced robust proinflammatory responses by all of the primary ferret LECs.
8574,Chemotaxis was performed to determine the functional activity of CCL20 produced by the primary lung LECs and showed that the LEC-derived CCL20 was abundant and functional.
8575,"Taken together, our results continue to reveal the innate immune potential of primary LECs during pathogen-host interactions and expand our understanding of the roles of LECs might play in health and disease in animal models."
8576,Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally.
8577,"In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates."
8578,Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination.
8579,"In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use."
8580,"Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication."
8581,"However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently."
8582,Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics.
8583,This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.
8584," As interest in the development of oral vaccines continues to rise, alternative animal models for studies of mucosal immunity are needed."
8585,The present study examines a simplified procedure for delivering antigen to rabbit Peyer's patches via an indwelling cannula.
8586,"The cannula was placed 3–4 cm proximal to the Peyer's patch, and was used to deliver four weekly doses of the potent mucosal immunogen, cholera toxin (CT)."
8587,"Anti-CT specific fecal secretory IgA (S-IgA), serum IgG and serum IgA were found in essentially equal amounts in rabbits with cannulas and in rabbits fitted with Thiry-Vella (T-V) isolated ileal loops."
8588,"In contrast to animals with T-V loops, the intestinal flora of animals with cannulas contained less bacterial overgrowth with Pseudomonas sp."
8589,"Further, the villus architecture remained histologically normal in appearance and there were fewer post-surgical complications associated with this technique than with T-V loops."
8590,This simplified technique should allow wider use of rabbits in studies of mucosal immunity.
8591,"The twentieth century was marked by extraordinary advances in our understanding of microbes and infectious disease, but pandemics remain, food and waterborne illnesses are frequent, multidrug-resistant microbes are on the rise, and the needed drugs and vaccines have not been developed."
8592,The scientific approaches of the past—including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology—have not been sufficient to address these challenges.
8593,The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods.
8594,These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions.
8595,"To take full advantage of these innovations, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently initiated the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research."
8596,"As participants of the Systems Biology Program, we think that the time is at hand to redefine the pathogen-host research paradigm."
8597,"Pre-existing immunity against human adenovirus (HAd) serotype 5 derived vector in the human population is widespread, thus hampering its clinical use."
8598,"Various components of the immune system, including neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), Ad specific T cells and type I IFN activated NK cells, contribute to dampening the efficacy of Ad vectors in individuals with pre-existing Ad immunity."
8599,"In order to circumvent pre-existing immunity to adenovirus, numerous strategies, such as developing alternative Ad serotypes, varying immunization routes and utilizing prime-boost regimens, are under pre-clinical or clinical phases of development."
8600,"However, these strategies mainly focus on one arm of pre-existing immunity."
8601,Selection of alternative serotypes has been largely driven by the absence in the human population of nAbs against them with little attention paid to cross-reactive Ad specific T cells.
8602,"Conversely, varying the route of immunization appears to mainly rely on avoiding Ad specific tissue-resident T cells."
8603,"Finally, prime-boost regimens do not actually circumvent pre-existing immunity but instead generate immune responses of sufficient magnitude to confer protection despite pre-existing immunity."
8604,Combining the above strategies and thus taking into account all components regulating pre-existing Ad immunity will help further improve the development of Ad vectors for animal and human use.
8605,: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a tropical disease affecting over one million patients annually and Leishmania (L.) mexicana is one of the major etiological agents in the Americas.
8606,Here we established the first experimental infection of L. (L.) mexicana in canids.
8607,METHODS: Beagle dogs were infected intradermally with culture-derived L. (L.) mexicana.
8608,"We followed skin ulcer development, histopathological signs, parasite burden and the immune status of the infected dogs."
8609,"RESULTS: All infected dogs developed uniform oval-craterform ulcers similar to those observed in humans, associated with mixed T helper 1/T helper 2 immune responses."
8610,Parasites were detected in the healed lesions 15 weeks post-infection.
8611,Higher anti-Leishmania IgG levels correlated with larger lesions and high IgG1/IgG2 ratio was associated with some level of splenomegaly.
8612,"CONCLUSIONS: The canine model described in this work will be of use for further understanding of L. (L.) mexicana immunopathogenensis, and for drug and vaccine development."
8613,"The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture."
8614,Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination.
8615,"Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory."
8616,"Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat."
8617,"An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs."
8618,"As the Ebola outbreak in West Africa wanes, it is time for the international scientific community to reflect on how to improve the detection of and coordinated response to future epidemics."
8619,"Our interdisciplinary team identified key lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak that can be clustered into three areas: environmental conditions related to early warning systems, host characteristics related to public health, and agent issues that can be addressed through the laboratory sciences."
8620,"In particular, we need to increase zoonotic surveillance activities, implement more effective ecological health interventions, expand prediction modeling, support medical and public health systems in order to improve local and international responses to epidemics, improve risk communication, better understand the role of social media in outbreak awareness and response, produce better diagnostic tools, create better therapeutic medications, and design better vaccines."
8621,This list highlights research priorities and policy actions the global community can take now to be better prepared for future emerging infectious disease outbreaks that threaten global public health and security.
8622,"Human influenza pandemics over the last 100 years have been caused by H1, H2, and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses."
8623,"More recently, avian influenza viruses have been found to directly infect humans from their avian hosts."
8624,"The recent emergence, host expansion, and spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Asia has heightened concerns globally, both in regards to mortality of HPAI H5N1 in humans and the potential of a new pandemic."
8625,"In response, many agencies and organizations have been working collaboratively to develop early detection systems, preparedness plans, and objectives for further research."
8626,"As a result, there has been a large influx of published information regarding potential risk, surveillance, prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza, particularly in regards to animal to human and subsequent human to human transmission."
8627,This chapter will review the current human infections with avian influenza and its public health and medical implications.
8628,"Presence of ducks, and in particular of free-grazing ducks, has consistently been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks which has compromised poultry production in South-East Asia since the early 2000s and continues to threaten public health, farmers’ livelihood and food security."
8629,"Although free-grazing duck production has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses."
8630,"This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing duck production system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses."
8631,"We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing duck production system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam."
8632,Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse.
8633,"The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot."
8634,"A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H5 subtypes."
8635,The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks.
8636,"These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers."
8637,: Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major problem for global public health.
8638,"Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg “window stage”, active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB."
8639,METHODS: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used.
8640,"The “sandwich” therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated."
8641,"FINDINGS: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally."
8642,"When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered."
8643,A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these “sandwich”-treated mice.
8644,"Efficient intrahepatic anti-HBV immune responses were also observed in these mice, including the formation of aggregates of myeloid cells with CD8(+)T cells and increased TNF-α, granzyme B production."
8645,"INTERPRETATION: The “sandwich” combination therapy not only efficiently decreased HBsAg and HBV DNA levels but also induced effective cellular and humoral immunity, which may result in functional cure of CHB."
8646,How virulence evolves after a virus jumps to a new host species is central to disease emergence.
8647,"Our current understanding of virulence evolution is based on insights drawn from two perspectives that have developed largely independently: long-standing evolutionary theory based on limited real data examples that often lack a genomic basis, and experimental studies of virulence-determining mutations using cell culture or animal models."
8648,A more comprehensive understanding of virulence mutations and their evolution can be achieved by bridging the gap between these two research pathways through the phylogenomic analysis of virus genome sequence data as a guide to experimental study.
8649,Emergence of drug resistance among the causative organisms for respiratory tract infections represents a critical challenge to the global health care community.
8650,"Further, although vaccination can prevent disease, vaccine development is impeded by several factors."
8651,"Therefore, novel approaches to treat and manage respiratory infections are urgently needed."
8652,Passive immunization represents a possible alternative to meet this need.
8653,Immunoglobulin Y antibodies (IgYs) from the yolk of chicken eggs have previously been used against bacterial and viral infections in human and animals.
8654,"Their advantages include lack of reaction with mammalian Fc receptors, low production cost, and ease of extraction."
8655,"Compared to mammalian IgGs, they have higher target specificity and greater binding avidity."
8656,They also possess remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity in the respiratory tract and lungs.
8657,"In this review, we provide an overview of avian IgYs and describe their potential therapeutic applications for the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections."
8658,"OBJECTIVE: The objective is to perform a comprehensive review of the literature from January 2007 through June 2011 on the virology, bacteriology, and immunology related to otitis media."
8659,DATA SOURCES: PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine.
8660,"REVIEW METHODS: Three subpanels with co-chairs comprising experts in the virology, bacteriology, and immunology of otitis media were formed."
8661,Each of the panels reviewed the literature in their respective fields and wrote draft reviews.
8662,"The reviews were shared with all panel members, and a second draft was created."
8663,The entire panel met at the 10th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Otitis Media in June 2011 and discussed the review and refined the content further.
8664,"A final draft was created, circulated, and approved by the panel."
8665,CONCLUSION: Excellent progress has been made in the past 4 years in advancing an understanding of the microbiology and immunology of otitis media.
8666,"Advances include laboratory-based basic studies, cell-based assays, work in animal models, and clinical studies."
8667,IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The advances of the past 4 years formed the basis of a series of short-term and long-term research goals in an effort to guide the field.
8668,"Accomplishing these goals will provide opportunities for the development of novel interventions, including new ways to better treat and prevent otitis media."
8669,Zoonosis is an infectious disease and a potential bioterrorism agent.
8670,"Bioterrorism aimed at a society, government, and/or its citizens is meant to cause destabilization, fear, anxiety, illness, and death in people, animals, or plants using biological agents."
8671,"A bioterrorism attack is the intentional release of biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, rickettsial or chlamydial organisms, toxins, or other harmful agents."
8672,"This chapter focuses on the induction, monitoring, and prevention of some zoonotic diseases that have potential as bioterrorism agents."
8673,"The etiology, clinical manifestations, transmission routes, and treatment of these zoonotic agents are briefly discussed."
8674,Mucosal vaccination against amoebiasis using the Gal-lectin of E. histolytica has been proposed as one of the leading strategies for controlling this human disease.
8675,"However, most mucosal adjuvants used are toxic and the identification of safe delivery systems is necessary."
8676,"Here, we evaluate the potential of a recombinant Autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin to confer protection against amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in hamsters following oral or nasal immunization."
8677,"Hamsters immunized by oral route showed complete absence (57.9%) or partial development (21%) of ALA, resulting in some protection in 78.9% of animals when compared with the wild type baculovirus and sham control groups."
8678,"In contrast, nasal immunization conferred only 21% of protection efficacy."
8679,"Levels of ALA protection showed lineal correlation with the development of an anti-amoebic cellular immune response evaluated in spleens, but not with the induction of seric IgG anti-amoeba antibodies."
8680,"These results suggest that baculovirus driving the expression of E. histolytica vaccine candidate antigens is useful for inducing protective cellular and humoral immune responses following oral immunization, and therefore it could be used as a system for mucosal delivery of an anti-amoebic vaccine."
8681,"For more than 2,000 years, it was thought that malignant spirits caused diseases."
8682,"By the end of nineteenth century, these beliefs were displaced by more modern concepts of disease, namely, the formulation of the “germ theory,” which asserted that bacteria or other microorganisms caused disease."
8683,"With the emergence of chronic degenerative and of autoimmune diseases in the last century, the causative role of microorganisms has been intensely debated; however, no clear explanatory models have been achieved."
8684,"In this review, we examine the current available literature regarding the relationships between infections and 16 autoimmune diseases."
8685,"We critically analyzed clinical, serological, and molecular associations, and reviewed experimental models of induction of and, alternatively, protection from autoimmune diseases by infection."
8686,"After reviewing several studies and reports, a clinical and experimental pattern emerges: Chronic and multiple infections with viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, and bacteria, such as H. pylori, may, in susceptible individuals, play a role in the evolvement of autoimmune diseases."
8687,"As the vast majority of infections pertain to our resident microbiota and endogenous retroviruses and healthy carriage of infections is the rule, we propose to focus on understanding the mechanisms of this healthy carrier state and what changes its configurations to infectious syndromes, to the restoration of health, or to the sustaining of illness into a chronic state and/or autoimmune disease."
8688,"It seems that in the development of this healthy carriage state, the infection or colonization in early stages of ontogenesis with key microorganisms, also called ‘old friends’ (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria among others), are important for the healthy living and for the protection from infectious and autoimmune syndromes."
8689,": Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is associated with respiratory infections in cattle of all ages; however, a temporal study to evaluate the effect of BCV immunity on virus shedding and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) incidence in pre-weaned beef calves has not been reported."
8690,"Thus, we report here a prospective study in three herds of crossbred beef calves (n = 817) with endemic BCV."
8691,Serial blood samples for measurement of serum anti-BCV antibody titers and nasal swabs for detection of BCV and other common viral and bacterial BRD pathogens were collected from all calves or subsets of calves at predetermined times from birth through weaning.
8692,The calves were monitored for BRD and those that developed signs of respiratory disease were sampled for diagnostic testing.
8693,"To discover additional risk factors that could have influenced BRD development, sequence analysis of the BCV strain(s) circulating in each herd, and the prevalence of common opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also evaluated."
8694,RESULTS: Two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study calves (30.4%) were treated for BRD prior to weaning; 246 of those were from a single herd involved in two outbreaks of BRD leading to mass treatment of all calves in that group.
8695,Molecular diagnostic testing found BCV and Histophilus somni in nasal swabs taken at the time of BRD treatment.
8696,"Between herd analyses revealed anti-BCV serum antibody abundance did not associate with the incidence of BRD or BCV shedding, though these measurements may have been hindered by the long periods between sample collections."
8697,"Analysis of the BCV spike gene hypervariable region revealed four polymorphisms in 15 isolates from the three herds, making strain variation unlikely to account for differences in treatment rates between herds."
8698,Persistent or recurrent shedding episodes of BCV occurred in some animals treated for BRD.
8699,CONCLUSION: Co-detection of BCV and H. somni at the time of the disease outbreak suggests that these pathogens contributed to disease pathogenesis.
8700,Developing appropriate control measures for respiratory BCV infections may help decrease the incidence of pre-weaning BRD.
8701,The role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined.
8702,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12917-019-1887-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
8703, Biological response modifiers (BRMs) are agents which can modify the immune response to cancer or invasion of the organism by infectious agents.
8704,An explosive appearance of new BRMs has resulted from the development of recombinant gene technology and the availability of monoclonal antibodies.
8705,Colony-stimulating factors first became available for the prevention of neutropenia but may also have a role in the treatment of infections.
8706,Interleukin-1 is being tested as a modular of hematopoiesis and may be useful as a helper factor for T- and B-cell function.
8707,Immunoglobulins are being used against viral and bacterial infections while interferons can prevent viral upper respiratory infections and suppress or irradicate some viral hepatitides.
8708,Other BRMs which show promise include chemical agents and traditional herbal medicines.
8709, The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and of the Middle East Syndrome Cornavirus (MERS-CoV) caused widespread fear and concern for their potential threat to global health security.
8710,There are similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two diseases.
8711,The origin of SARS-COV and MERS-CoV is thought to be an animal source with subsequent transmission to humans.
8712,The identification of both the intermediate host and the exact route of transmission of MERS-CoV is crucial for the subsequent prevention of the introduction of the virus into the human population.
8713,So far MERS-CoV had resulted in a limited travel-associated human cases with no major events related to the Hajj.
8714, Non-vaccine Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes are increasingly associated with disease.
8715,"We evaluated isolates of the same sequence type (ST199) but different serotypes (15B/C, 19A) for growth in vitro, and pathogenic potential in a chinchilla otitis media model."
8716,"We also developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to quantitatively assess each isolate, circumventing the need for selectable markers."
8717,In vitro studies showed faster growth of serotype 19A over 15B/C.
8718,Both were equally capable of colonization and middle ear infection in this model.
8719,Serotype 19A is included in new conjugate vaccine formulations while serotype 15B/C is not.
8720,Non-capsular vaccine targets will be important in disease prevention efforts.
8721,: Recent epidemics have entailed global discussions on revamping epidemic control and prevention approaches.
8722,A general consensus is that all sources of data should be embraced to improve epidemic preparedness.
8723,"As a disease transmission is inherently governed by individual-level responses, pathogen dynamics within infected hosts posit high potentials to inform population-level phenomena."
8724,We propose a multiscale approach showing that individual dynamics were able to reproduce population-level observations.
8725,"METHODS: Using experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters."
8726,The models were then embedded in our implementation of an age-specific contact network that allows to express individual differences relevant to the transmission processes.
8727,This approach is illustrated with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV).
8728,RESULTS: The results showed that a within-host infection model can reproduce EBOV’s transmission parameters obtained from population data.
8729,"At the same time, population age-structure, contact distribution and patterns can be expressed using network generating algorithm."
8730,This framework opens a vast opportunity to investigate individual roles of factors involved in the epidemic processes.
8731,"Estimating EBOV’s reproduction number revealed a heterogeneous pattern among age-groups, prompting cautions on estimates unadjusted for contact pattern."
8732,Assessments of mass vaccination strategies showed that vaccination conducted in a time window from five months before to one week after the start of an epidemic appeared to strongly reduce epidemic size.
8733,"Noticeably, compared to a non-intervention scenario, a low critical vaccination coverage of 33% cannot ensure epidemic extinction but could reduce the number of cases by ten to hundred times as well as lessen the case-fatality rate."
8734,CONCLUSIONS: Experimental data on the within-host infection have been able to capture upfront key transmission parameters of a pathogen; the applications of this approach will give us more time to prepare for potential epidemics.
8735,The population of interest in epidemic assessments could be modelled with an age-specific contact network without exhaustive amount of data.
8736,Further assessments and adaptations for different pathogens and scenarios to explore multilevel aspects in infectious diseases epidemics are underway.
8737,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12889-018-5709-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
8738,: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) remains among the leading causes of death of cattle internationally.
8739,The objective of this study was to identify risk factors associated with exposure to BRD pathogens during the peri-weaning period (day (d)-14 to d 14 relative to weaning at 0) in dairy bull calves using serological responses to these pathogens as surrogate markers of exposure.
8740,Clinically normal Holstein-Friesian and Jersey breed bull calves (n = 72) were group housed in 4 pens using a factorial design with calves of different breeds and planes of nutrition in each pen.
8741,"Intrinsic, management and clinical data were collected during the pre-weaning (d − 56 to d − 14) period."
8742,Calves were gradually weaned over 14 days (d − 14 to d 0).
8743,"Serological analysis for antibodies against key BRD pathogens (BRSV, BPI3V, BHV-1, BHV-4, BCoV, BVDV and H. somni) was undertaken at d − 14 and d 14."
8744,"Linear regression models (for BVDV, BPI3V, BHV-1, BHV-4, BCoV and H. somni) and a single mixed effect random variable model (for BRSV) were used to identify risk factors for changes in antibody levels to these pathogens."
8745,RESULTS: BRSV was the only pathogen which demonstrated clustering by pen.
8746,Jersey calves experienced significantly lower changes in BVDV S/P than Holstein-Friesian calves.
8747,Animals with a high maximum respiratory score (≥8) recorded significant increases in H. somni S/P during the peri-weaning period when compared to those with respiratory scores of ≤3.
8748,Haptoglobin levels of between 1.32 and 1.60 mg/ml at d − 14 were significantly associated with decreases in BHV-1 S/N during the peri-weaning period.
8749,Higher BVDV S/P ratios at d − 14 were significantly correlated with increased changes in serological responses to BHV-4 over the peri-weaning period.
8750,CONCLUSIONS: Haptoglobin may have potential as a predictor of exposure to BHV-1.
8751,BRSV would appear to play a more significant role at the ‘group’ rather than ‘individual animal’ level.
8752,The significant associations between the pre-weaning levels of antibodies to certain BRD pathogens and changes in the levels of antibodies to the various pathogens during the peri-weaning period may reflect a cohort of possibly genetically linked ‘better responders’ among the study population.
8753,"The study of human respiratory syncytial virus pathogenesis and immunity has been hampered by its exquisite host specificity, and the difficulties encountered in adapting this virus to a murine host."
8754,"The reasons for this obstacle are not well understood, but appear to reflect, at least in part, the inability of the virus to block the interferon response in any but the human host."
8755,"This review addresses some of the issues encountered in mouse models of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and describes the advantages and disadvantages of alternative model systems."
8756,The next influenza pandemic may be imminent.
8757,"Because antiviral agents and vaccines will be unavailable to people in most countries, we need to determine whether other agents could offer clinical benefits."
8758,"Influenza is associated with an increase in acute cardiovascular diseases, and influenza viruses induce proinflammatory cytokines."
8759,"Statins are cardioprotective and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and they thus might benefit patients with influenza."
8760,This hypothesis should be evaluated by using administrative databases to search for reduced rates of hospitalization and death due to influenza-related conditions among people taking statins.
8761,"These studies should be followed by laboratory studies of statins in animal and cell-based models of influenza virus infection and, later, by clinical trials."
8762,Positive results from such studies would provide physicians in all countries with something to offer patients for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza.
8763,Generic statins will be widely distributed and inexpensive.
8764,They might be the only agents that could alter the course of a global pandemic.
8765,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family, which causes a threat to the domestic dog and fur-animal industry."
8766,"Hemagglutinin protein is a major membrane protein of the vital molecular factor in CDV tropism, also known to induce hosts to produce neutralizing antibodies."
8767,"In the current study, we prepared two monoclonal antibodies, 1A5 and 2B8, against the H protein of the CDV-PS strain."
8768,A series of partially overlapping synthetic peptides covering the hemagglutinin protein (amino acids 50–204) were screened to define the linear epitope identified by 1A5 and 2B8 mAbs.
8769,"(120)QKTNFFNPNREFDFR(134) (F8) and (178)ARGDIFPPY(186) (F14-1) are minimal linear epitopes recognized by 1A5 and 2B8 mAbs, respectively."
8770,"Further investigations revealed that F8 is conserved in different CDV strains; however, F14-1 contains mutant residues 178, 179, and 180."
8771,The epitopes F8 and F14-1 localized at the surface of hemagglutinin protein in a three-dimensional (3D) structure.
8772,CDV-infected dog serum can also recognize the identified B-cell epitopes.
8773,BackgroundImmunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) offers safe interventions for the prevention of infection in patients after organ transplantation and for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases.
8774,MAb 201 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)–specific MAb that prevents establishment of viral replication in vitro and prevents viral replication in vivo when administered prophylactically.
8775,"The efficacy of MAb 201 in the treatment of SARS was evaluated in golden Syrian hamsters, an animal model that supports SARS-CoV replication to high levels and displays severe pathological changes associated with infection, including pneumonitis and pulmonary consolidation MethodsGolden Syrian hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV were treated with various doses of MAb 201 or an irrelevant MAb 24 h after inoculation."
8776,"Two to 7 days after infection, the hamsters were killed, and their lungs were collected for evaluation of viral titers and pathological findings ResultsPostexposure treatment with MAb 201 can alleviate the viral burden and associated pathological findings in a golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV infection."
8777,"After a hamster is treated with MAb 201, its viral burden is reduced by 10(2.4)–10(3.9) 50% tissue-culture infectious doses per gram of tissue, and the severity of associated pathological findings, including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation, is also remarkably reduced ConclusionsThe demonstration of successful postexposure MAb 201 therapy in an animal model that demonstrates viral replication and associated pulmonary pathological findings suggests that MAb 201 may be useful in the arsenal of tools to combat SARS"
8778,Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of human (MPX).
8779,It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas.
8780,"Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible."
8781,"Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection."
8782,"Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread."
8783,"However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns."
8784,"For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent."
8785,"In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice."
8786,"BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)ΔTK, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD(106)ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD(106)ΔTK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated."
8787,"A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration."
8788,"Further, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD(106)ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD(106)ΔTK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1((-/-)) mice against mortality and morbidity."
8789,This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.

8791,"Since 2000, scientists and students from the greater Rocky Mountain region, along with invited speakers, both national and international, have gathered at the Mountain Campus of Colorado State University to discuss their area of study, present recent findings, establish or strengthen collaborations, and mentor the next generation of virologists and prionologists through formal presentations and informal discussions concerning science, grantsmanship and network development."
8792,"This year, approximately 100 people attended the 17th annual Rocky Mountain Virology Association meeting, that began with a keynote presentation, and featured 29 oral and 35 poster presentations covering RNA and DNA viruses, prions, virus-host interactions and guides to successful mentorship."
8793,"Since the keynote address focused on the structure and function of Zika and related flaviviruses, a special session was held to discuss RNA control."
8794,The secluded meeting at the foot of the Colorado Rocky Mountains gave ample time for in-depth discussions amid the peak of fall colors in the aspen groves while the random bear provided excitement.
8795,"On behalf of the Rocky Mountain Virology Association, this report summarizes the >50 reports."
8796,Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds throughout the world and are separated into nine serotypes (APMV-1 to -9).
8797,"Only in the case of APMV-1, the infection of non-avian species has been investigated."
8798,The APMVs presently are being considered as human vaccine vectors.
8799,"In this study, we evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of all nine APMV serotypes in hamsters."
8800,"The hamsters were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for clinical disease, pathology, histopathology, virus replication, and seroconversion."
8801,"On the basis of one or more of these criteria, each of the APMV serotypes was found to replicate in hamsters."
8802,"The APMVs produced mild or inapparent clinical signs in hamsters except for APMV-9, which produced moderate disease."
8803,"Gross lesions were observed over the pulmonary surface of hamsters infected with APMV-2 & -3, which showed petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages, respectively."
8804,"Replication of all of the APMVs except APMV-5 was confirmed in the nasal turbinates and lungs, indicating a tropism for the respiratory tract."
8805,"Histologically, the infection resulted in lung lesions consistent with bronchointerstitial pneumonia of varying severity and nasal turbinates with blunting or loss of cilia of the epithelium lining the nasal septa."
8806,The majority of APMV-infected hamsters exhibited transient histological lesions that self resolved by 14 days post infection (dpi).
8807,"All of the hamsters infected with the APMVs produced serotype-specific HI or neutralizing antibodies, confirming virus replication."
8808,"Taken together, these results demonstrate that all nine known APMV serotypes are capable of replicating in hamsters with minimal disease and pathology."
8809,Human coronaviruses cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans.
8810,"In 2012, a sixth human coronavirus (hCoV) was isolated from a patient presenting with severe respiratory illness."
8811,"The 60-year-old man died as a result of renal and respiratory failure after admission to a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."
8812,The aetiological agent was eventually identified as a coronavirus and designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
8813,"MERS-CoV has now been reported in more than 27 countries across the Middle East, Europe, North Africa and Asia."
8814,"As of July 2017, 2040 MERS-CoV laboratory confirmed cases, resulting in 712 deaths, were reported globally, with a majority of these cases from the Arabian Peninsula."
8815,"This review summarises the current understanding of MERS-CoV, with special reference to the (i) genome structure; (ii) clinical features; (iii) diagnosis of infection; and (iv) treatment and vaccine development."
8816," Numerous Kampo medicines and Oriental herbs have been used for the treatment of infectious diseases for several reasons, such as genetic background, economical reasons, fewer adverse effects, and so on."
8817,This chapter describes Kampo medicines and related Oriental herbs that are effective or promising in the treatment of infectious diseases at the clinical level and/or in animal models.
8818,"In addition, effective Kampo medicines tested in vitro in cultured-cell studies are also included in this chapter."
8819,Each section is categorized by infectious disease and according to the popularity of the Kampo medicine.
8820," Animal models of malaria, mainly mice, have made a large contribution to our knowledge of host–pathogen interactions and immune responses, and to drug and vaccine design."
8821,"Non-human primate (NHP) models for malaria are admittedly under-used, although they are probably closer models than mice for human malaria; in particular, NHP models allow the use of human pathogens (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi)."
8822,"NHPs, whether natural hosts or experimentally challenged with a simian Plasmodium, can also serve as robust pre-clinical models."
8823,"Some simian parasites are closely related to a human counterpart, with which they may share a common ancestor, and display similar major features with the human infection and pathology."
8824,"NHP models allow longitudinal studies, from the early events following sporozoite inoculation to the later events, including analysis of organs and tissues, particularly liver, spleen, brain and bone marrow."
8825,NHP models have one other significant advantage over mouse models: NHPs are our closest relatives and thus their biology is very similar to ours.
8826,Recently developed in vivo imaging tools have provided insight into malaria parasite infection and disease in mouse models.
8827,"One advantage of these tools is that they limit the need for invasive procedures, such as tissue biopsies."
8828,Many such technologies are now available for NHP studies and provide new opportunities for elucidating host/parasite interactions.
8829,"The aim of this review is to bring the malaria community up to date on what is currently possible and what soon will be, in terms of in vivo imaging in NHP models of malaria, to consider the pros and the cons of the various techniques, and to identify challenges."
8830,Viruses serve as infectious agents for all living entities.
8831,"There have been various research groups that focus on understanding the viruses in terms of their host-viral relationships, pathogenesis and immune evasion."
8832,"However, with the current advances in the field of science, now the research field has widened up at the ‘omics’ level."
8833,"Apparently, generation of viral sequence data has been increasing."
8834,There are numerous bioinformatics tools available that not only aid in analysing such sequence data but also aid in deducing useful information that can be exploited in developing preventive and therapeutic measures.
8835,This chapter elaborates on bioinformatics tools that are specifically designed for animal viruses as well as other generic tools that can be exploited to study animal viruses.
8836,"The chapter further provides information on the tools that can be used to study viral epidemiology, phylogenetic analysis, structural modelling of proteins, epitope recognition and open reading frame (ORF) recognition and tools that enable to analyse host-viral interactions, gene prediction in the viral genome, etc."
8837,Various databases that organize information on animal and human viruses have also been described.
8838,"The chapter will converse on overview of the current advances, online and downloadable tools and databases in the field of bioinformatics that will enable the researchers to study animal viruses at gene level."
8839, Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces infectious bronchitis (IB) disease in poultry worldwide.
8840,"In spite of proper vaccinations against the IBV, new IBV strains are continually emerging worldwide."
8841,"In this study, a new highly virulent nephropathogenic IBV strain named CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 was identified from a vaccinated flock with clinical signs of IB in the Jiangsu province of China."
8842,"The full-length genome sequence of the isolate was 27,714 nucleotides long, and the genome was organized similarly to classical IBV strains."
8843,"Minimum divergence, phylogenetic analysis, and distance matrix of the genome showed that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate had the highest similarity to the IBV BJ strain."
8844,The spike glycoprotein (S) gene had the greatest similarity to the nephropathogenic BJ strain and showed an 8 amino acid insertion (YSNGNSDV) at 73 to 80 sites and 3 amino acid deletion at sites 126 to 128 compared to the IBV vaccine strains.
8845,A recombination analysis of the S gene showed that the new isolate evolved from the IBV BJ strain and the KM91 vaccine strain.
8846,An animal challenge experiment showed a mortality of 60 to 80% in early-age chickens by different inoculation routes.
8847,"Pathological examinations of the kidneys revealed inflammation, distention with uric acid deposits, and tubular degeneration."
8848,"It indicated that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate has robust kidney tissue tropism, and new nephropathogenic IBV strains are continuously evolving in China."
8849,Domestic cats (Felis cattus) comprise a small (2%) percentage of the non-rodent animals used in biomedical research.
8850,"In 2011, 21,700 cats of a total 1,134,693 non-rodent animals were used in research (APHIS, 2011)."
8851,"According to the National Research Council Committee on Scientific and Humane Issues in the Use of Random Source Dogs and Cats in Research (National Research Council, 2009), peak use of cats occurred in 1974."
8852,"Since that time, the number of cats used in research has fallen by 71%, with more than 98% of those cats being purpose bred for research."
8853,"Cats are a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) covered species with special housing requirements defined in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC, 2011)."
8854,"At the request of congress, a committee of experts formed by the National Research Council examined the use of random source dogs and cats and concluded that obtaining dogs and cats from Class B dealers is not necessary for NIH funded research (National Research Council, 2009)."
8855,"While the number of cats used in biomedical research has declined, cats continue to contribute uniquely to biomedical science and are valuable research model for several disciplines, including aspects of neurology involved in locomotion and spinal trauma, retrovirus and zoonotic disease research, and for developing therapeutic strategies for inherited diseases."
8856," Although influenza A and B viruses are primarily known as respiratory viruses and mainly infected only the upper respiratory tract in humans, patients with influenza often develop signs and symptoms that are not due to the respiratory system."
8857,"Frequently individuals with influenza develop headaches, meningismus, and even seizures in addition to their typical respiratory symptoms."
8858,"In the past decades, influenza viruses have also been associated with serious non-respiratory signs."
8859,The famous 1918 strain of influenza was associated with von Economo's encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism.
8860,In the 1960s influenza virus infections in children were associated with Reye's syndrome characterized often by fatty non-inflammatory hepatic disease and an encephalopathy with marked non-inflammatory cerebral edema.
8861,Intermittently children with influenza develop focal myalgia and myositis.
8862,Guillain–Barré syndrome was epidemiologically associated with the 1978 killed influenza vaccine but not subsequent vaccines.
8863,"Although occasional children with influenza have developed encephalopathy, from 2000 through 2004 there was an increase in the number of serious cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy accompanying infection with the influenza A 2009 strain."
8864,The current H5N1 strain of bird influenza occasionally infects humans with a high mortality rate and some appear to have central nervous signs.
8865,This chapter explores what is known about these influenza neurologic associations.
8866,Host-range shifts in influenza virus are a major risk factor for pandemics.
8867,"A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control."
8868,Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV).
8869,"CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters."
8870,We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R(0) = 3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population.
8871,"Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction/invasion threshold of the host contact network."
8872,"Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R(e)) in the general dog population is close to 1.0."
8873,"Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency."
8874,"Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza."
8875,THE EFFICACY OF BIOENGINEERED ANTI-TOXINS AND VACCINES FOR ANIMAL HEALTH CARE
8876," Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality."
8877,Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry.
8878,"Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively."
8879,Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are two rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks.
8880,Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta.
8881,Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia—with suboptimum biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms—predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation.
8882,Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear.
8883,Most of the human pandemics reported to date can be classified as zoonoses.
8884,"Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans."
8885,"For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens' transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption."
8886,"Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections."
8887,"In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern."
8888,"Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population."
8889,"In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas."
8890,"However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension."
8891,"Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas."
8892,"There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP."
8893,"In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection."
8894,"Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic."
8895,"This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens' transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP."
8896,"Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals."
8897,The emergence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) in the last two decades has illuminated their potential to cause high morbidity and mortality in human populations and disrupt global economies.
8898,"Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures."
8899,Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections.
8900,"Therefore, understanding how hCoV–host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans."
8901,Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoV–host interactions that govern pathogenesis.
8902,"Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus–host interaction networks in disease."
8903,"In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs."
8904,"Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, an overarching directive of the World Health Organization."
8905,"Although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates, we focus this review on the current state of hCoV mouse models, their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hCoV–host interactions, and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions."
8906,"In 2012, a novel coronavirus (CoV) associated with severe respiratory disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV; previously known as human coronavirus–Erasmus Medical Center or hCoV-EMC), emerged in the Arabian Peninsula."
8907,"To date, 114 human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, with 54 fatalities."
8908,Animal models for MERS-CoV infection of humans are needed to elucidate MERS pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and antivirals.
8909,"In this study, we developed rhesus macaques as a model for MERS-CoV using intratracheal inoculation."
8910,"The infected monkeys showed clinical signs of disease, virus replication, histological lesions, and neutralizing antibody production, indicating that this monkey model is suitable for studies of MERS-CoV infection."
8911,": There is no information concerning the genotype of Canine parvovirus (CPV) currently circulating in Henan province, China."
8912,"Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide insights into the epidemiology and molecular characterization of CPV circulating in Henan province from 2009 to 2014."
8913,"RESULTS: Nineteen thousand nine hundred seven dogs from pet hospitals in the cities of Luoyang, Anyang, Jiaozuo, Sanmenxia, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou in Henan province between 2009 and 2014 were investigated."
8914,"Over the 6-year period, 1169 CPV-positive cases were identified and the morbidity of CPV infection ranged from 4.16 to 8.06 %, although morbidity was not significant (P > 0.05) between 2009 and 2014."
8915,"Factors associated with morbidity included sampling season, dog age, breed, vaccination status, and sex."
8916,"CPV co-infection with coccidium (10.00 %), canine distemper virus (4.79 %), hookworm (2.40 %), canine coronavirus (1.11 %), roundworm (1.03 %), tapeworm (0.17 %) and Babesia spp."
8917,(0.09 %) were observed.
8918,The new CPV-2a variant was more prevalent than the new CPV-2b variant in Henan province.
8919,CPV 2c was not observed in this study.
8920,"CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of CPV infection and identification of the circulating genotypes in Henan province, China from 2009 to 2014 determined that the new CPV-2a variant was more prevalent."
8921,While …
8922,Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors promote long-term gene transfer in many animal species.
8923,Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease.
8924,"However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV)."
8925,rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses.
8926,"Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors."
8927,"In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination."
8928,We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6.
8929,"In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls."
8930,"Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction."
8931,We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6-vaccination in neonatal mice.
8932,The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate.
8933,We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period.
8934,"Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart."
8935,All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6-vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood.
8936,"Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice."
8937,The objective of this research was to investigate the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection primarily in dromedary camel farms and the relationship of those infections with infections in humans in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
8938,Nasal swabs from 1113 dromedary camels (39 farms) and 34 sheep (1 farm) and sputum samples from 2 MERS-CoV-infected camel farm owners and 1 MERS-CoV-infected sheep farm owner were collected.
8939,Samples from camels and humans underwent real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR screening to detect MERS-CoV.
8940,"In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterized MERS-CoV genome fragments obtained from camels were performed."
8941,"Among the 40 farms, 6 camel farms were positive for MERS-CoV; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm."
8942,The maximum duration of viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the first positive test result as detected in nasal swabs and in rectal swabs obtained from infected calves.
8943,"Three partial camel sequences characterized in this study (open reading frames 1a and 1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported MERS-CoV sequence obtained from one farm owner were clustering together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster containing human and camel isolates reported for the Arabian Peninsula."
8944,Data provided further evidence of the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV infection and strongly suggested that camels may have a role in the transmission of the virus to humans.
8945, Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are considered widespread among cattle in Norway and worldwide.
8946,This cross-sectional study was conducted based on antibody-ELISA of bulk tank milk (BTM) from 1347 herds in two neighboring counties in western Norway.
8947,"The study aims were to determine the seroprevalence at herd level, to evaluate risk factors for BRSV and BCoV seropositivity, and to assess how these factors were associated with the spatial distribution of positive herds."
8948,"The overall prevalence of BRSV and BCoV positive herds in the region was 46.2% and 72.2%, respectively."
8949,"Isopleth maps of the prevalence risk distribution showed large differences in prevalence risk across the study area, with the highest prevalence in the northern region."
8950,"Common risk factors of importance for both viruses were herd size, geographic location, and proximity to neighbors."
8951,Seropositivity for one virus was associated with increased odds of seropositivity for the other virus.
8952,"Purchase of livestock was an additional risk factor for BCoV seropositivity, included in the model as in-degree, which was defined as the number of incoming movements from individual herds, through animal purchase, over a period of five years."
8953,Local dependence and the contribution of risk factors to this effect were assessed using the residuals from two logistic regression models for each virus.
8954,"One model contained only the x- and y- coordinates as predictors, the other had all significant predictors included."
8955,Spatial clusters of high values of residuals were detected using the normal model of the spatial scan statistic and visualized on maps.
8956,"Adjusting for the risk factors in the final models had different impact on the spatial clusters for the two viruses: For BRSV the number of clusters was reduced from six to four, for BCoV the number of clusters remained the same, however the log-likelihood ratios changed notably."
8957,"This indicates that geographical differences in proximity to neighbors, herd size and animal movements explain some of the spatial clusters of BRSV- and BCoV seropositivity, but far from all."
8958,"The remaining local dependence in the residuals show that the antibody status of one herd is influenced by the antibody status of its neighbors, indicating the importance of indirect transmission and that increased biosecurity routines might be an important preventive strategy."
8959,"Two groups with three wild boars each were used: Group A (animals 1 to 3) served as the control, and Group B (animals 4 to 6) was postnatally persistently infected with the Cat01 strain of CSFV (primary virus)."
8960,"The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus)."
8961,"For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain."
8962,"The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples."
8963,"Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo."
8964,"Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated ΔCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently."
8965,"In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain."
8966,"Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus."
8967,"Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B."
8968,"Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination."
8969,"To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-α, which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms."
8970,Antibodies have been used for more than 100 years in the therapy of infectious diseases but a new generation of highly potent and/or broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies (sometimes referred to as ‘super-antibodies’) offers new opportunities for intervention.
8971,"The isolation of these antibodies, which are often rarely induced in human infections, has primarily been achieved by large-scale screening for suitable donors and new single B cell approaches to human monoclonal antibody generation."
8972,Engineering the antibodies to improve half-life and effector functions has further augmented their in vivo activity in some cases.
8973,"Super-antibodies offer promise for the prophylaxis and therapy of infections with a range of viruses, including those that are highly antigenically variable and those that are newly emerging or have pandemic potential."
8974,The next few years will be decisive in the realization of the promise of super-antibodies.
8975, Infectious disease control and prevention relies on a thorough understanding of the factors determining transmission.
8976,"This article summarizes the fundamental principles of infectious disease transmission while highlighting many of the agent, host, and environmental determinants of these diseases that are of particular import to public health professionals."
8977,"Basic principles of infectious disease diagnosis, control, and prevention are also reviewed."
8978,Current progress in the development of vaccines has decreased the incidence of fatal and non-fatal infections and increased longevity.
8979,"However, new technologies need to be developed to combat an emerging generation of infectious diseases."
8980,DNA vaccination has been demonstrated to have great potential for use with a wide variety of diseases.
8981,"Alone, this technology does not generate a significant immune response for vaccination, but combined with delivery by electroporation (EP), can enhance plasmid expression and immunity."
8982,"Most EP systems, while effective, can be invasive and painful making them less desirable for use in vaccination."
8983,"Our lab recently developed a non-invasive electrode known as the multi-electrode array (MEA), which lies flat on the surface of the skin without penetrating the tissue."
8984,In this study we evaluated the MEA for its use in DNA vaccination using Hepatitis B virus as the infectious model.
8985,We utilized the guinea pig model because their skin is similar in thickness and morphology to humans.
8986,The plasmid encoding Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was delivered intradermally with the MEA to guinea pig skin.
8987,The results show increased protein expression resulting from plasmid delivery using the MEA as compared to injection alone.
8988,"Within 48 hours of treatment, there was an influx of cellular infiltrate in experimental groups."
8989,Humoral responses were also increased significantly in both duration and intensity as compared to injection only groups.
8990,"While this electrode requires further study, our results suggest that the MEA has potential for use in electrically mediated intradermal DNA vaccination."
8991,Climate change and multiple emerging infectious diseases
8992,"In recent years, the demand for new antiviral strategies has increased markedly."
8993,"There are many contributing factors to this increased demand, including the ever-increasing prevalence of chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, and the emergence of new viruses such as the SARS coronavirus."
8994,The potential danger of haemorrhagic fever viruses and eradicated viruses such as variola virus being used as bioterrorist weapons has also increased the profile of antiviral drug discovery.
8995,"Here, the virus infections for which antiviral therapy is needed and the compounds that are available, or are being developed, for the treatment of these infections are described."
8996,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrmicro975) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
8997,Clinical presentation of SARS is nonspecific; the important clinical findings in West Nile virus infection are those associated with neurological complications.
8998,Rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS and West Nile virus infection remains an important clinical challenge.
8999,"Older adults are at higher risk of complications, including death from SARS and West Nile virus."
9000,"At present, there is no effective therapy for these infections."
9001,"Although efforts are under way, there are presently no effective vaccines for SARS or West Nile virus."
9002," The virus was first described 120 years ago as a filterable, transmissible agent that causes disease in plants and animals."
9003,A virus is a “submicroscopic and intracellular parasite” that can propagate only inside a living cell.
9004,The obligatory nature of a virus brought a debate on whether it is living or nonliving.
9005,"Virology, as a discipline that studies the diverse aspects of viral infection of host cells and its consequence, became established during the early 20th century."
9006,"Viruses are found in almost all living organisms on earth, ranging from bacteria, fungi, and amoeba, to plants and animals."
9007,"Viruses are classified into seven groups, according to genomic features."
9008,"This molecular classification, also called the “Baltimore classification,” allows us to predict precisely the mode of viral genome replication."
9009,"In recent decades, many infectious diseases have significantly increased in incidence and/or geographic range, in some cases impacting heavily on human, animal or plant populations."
9010,Some of these ‘emerging infectious diseases’ are associated with pathogens that have appeared in populations for the first time as a result of cross-species transmission (e.g.
9011,"human immunodeficiency virus—acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), while others were previously known but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range as a result of underlying epidemiological changes (e.g."
9012,"multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, dengue, West Nile encephalitis, foot and mouth disease, cassava mosaic disease)."
9013,"The latter include prominent diseases as tuberculosis, malaria and yellow fever that were once on the decline but are now ‘re-emerging diseases’."
9014, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are members of the filovirus family and induce a fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates with 90% case fatality.
9015,"To develop a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus disease, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were intramuscularly inoculated with wild type Marburgvirus Musoke or Ebolavirus Zaire."
9016,The infection resulted in a systemic fatal disease with clinical and morphological features closely resembling human infection.
9017,"Animals experienced weight loss, fever, high virus titers in tissue, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, high liver transaminases and phosphatases and disseminated intravascular coagulation."
9018,Evidence of a severe disseminated viral infection characterized principally by multifocal to coalescing hepatic necrosis was seen in EBOV animals.
9019,MARV-infected animals displayed only moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen.
9020,Lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytic depletion observed in spleen.
9021,These findings provide support for the use of the common marmoset as a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever.
9022, Infectious disease surveillance in companion animals has a long history.
9023,"However, it has mostly taken the form of ad hoc surveys, or has focused on adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals."
9024,In 2006 a Blue Ribbon Panel was convened by the U.S. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to discuss the potential utility of a national companion animal health surveillance system.
9025,"Such a system could provide fundamental information about disease occurrence, transmission and risk factors; and could facilitate industry-supported pharmaco-epidemiological studies and post-market surveillance."
9026,"Disease WatchDog, a prospective national disease surveillance project, was officially launched in January 2010 to capture data on diseases in dogs and cats throughout Australia."
9027,Participation is encouraged by providing registrants real-time disease maps and material for improved communication between veterinarians and clients.
9028,"From January to mid-November 2010, an estimated 31% of veterinary clinics Australia-wide joined the project."
9029,"Over 1300 disease cases – including Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Distemper, Canine Hepatitis, Feline Calicivirus, Feline Herpesvirus, and Tick Paralysis – were reported."
9030,"In New South Wales alone, 552 CPV cases in dogs were reported from 89 postcode locations."
9031,New South Wales data was scanned using the space–time permutation test.
9032,"Up to 24 clusters (P <0.01) were identified, occurring in all months except March."
9033,The greatest number of clusters (n =6) were identified in April.
9034,"The most likely cluster was identified in western Sydney, where 36 cases of CPV were reported from a postcode in February."
9035,"Although the project is still in its infancy, already new information on disease distribution has been produced."
9036,Disease information generated could facilitate targeted control and prevention programs.
9037, The objective of this study is to evaluate the passive protective efficiency of immunoglobulin in yolk (IgY) specific against human enterovirus type 71 (EV71).
9038,"The antibody was raised by intramuscular immunization to 10 White Leghorn hens, with inactivated human EV71 serving as the antigen."
9039,The titer and specificity of the antibody were analyzed from purified IgY in the egg yolks of immunized hens.
9040,Results indicate that the titer of IgY specific against EV71 increased from the third week after the first immunization.
9041,"The content of total IgY was 190±26mg/yolk, with an average concentration of specific IgY of 6.34±3.38mg/yolk in the eggs from 3 to 18wk after immunization."
9042,"The results of the neutralization effect of specific IgY in EV71-challenged mice demonstrate that the EV71-specific IgY, either by intraperitoneal injection or oral administration, was able to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality in EV71 infected mice pups."
9043, Human rabies was first recorded in ancient China in about 556 BC and is still one of the major public-health problems in China.
9044,"From 1950 to 2015, 130,494 human rabies cases were reported in Mainland China with an average of 1977 cases per year."
9045,It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites.
9046,"The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained recently on studying the transmission of rabies in China."
9047,"We first construct a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and use the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010."
9048,"Then we modify the basic model by including both domestic and stray dogs and apply the model to simulate the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China."
9049,"To study the seasonality of rabies, in Section 4 we further propose a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates and employ the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010."
9050,"To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Section 5 we add diffusion to the dog population in the basic SEIR model to obtain a reaction–diffusion equation model and determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium."
9051,"Finally, in order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Section 6 we propose a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and use the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively."
9052,Some discussions are provided in Section 7.
9053,Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that shares a considerable degree of homology with dengue virus (DENV).
9054,"Here, we examined longitudinal antibody response against ZIKV during natural infection in 2 convalescent individuals."
9055,"By decomposing the antibody recognition into DI/DII and DIII of the E glycoprotein, we showed their development in humans followed a spatiotemporal hierarchy."
9056,Plasma binding to DI/DII appeared to peak and wane during early infection with extensive cross-reactivity with DI/DII of DENV.
9057,"Binding to DIII, however, peaked early but persisted months into the infection without detectable cross-reactivity with DIII of DENV."
9058,A clear trend of increase in DIII-specific neutralizing activity was observed over the course of infection.
9059,"mAbs isolated during early infection are largely DI/DII specific, weakly neutralizing, and highly cross-reactive with DENV, while those from later infection are more diverse in recognition, potently neutralizing, and ZIKV specific."
9060,The most potent neutralizing mAb targeting the DIII provided 100% protection in mice from lethal ZIKV infection and could therefore serve as a promising candidate for antibody-based therapy and prevention.
9061,The dynamic features unveiled here will assist us to better understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and inform rational design of vaccines.
9062,"Animal viruses of economic importance: Genetic variation, persistence, and prospects for their control"
9063,"Due to the enormous capacity of Staphylococcus aureus to acquire antibiotic resistance, it becomes imperative to develop vaccines for decreasing the risk of its life-threatening infections."
9064,Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a conserved and major component of S. aureus cell wall.
9065,"However, it has not been used as a vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen."
9066,"In this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide, named MAP27, which comprised four copies of a peptide that mimics the epitope of PGN."
9067,"After immunization with MAP27 five times and boosting with heat-inactivated bacterium one time, anti-MAP27 serum bound directly to S. aureus or PGN."
9068,Immunization with MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of BALB/c mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-challenge.
9069,"The percentage of IFN-γ(+)CD3(+) T cells and IL-17(+)CD4(+) T cells in spleen, as well as the levels of IFN-γ, IL-17A/F and CCL3 in spleen and lung, significantly increased in the MAP27-immunized mice after infection."
9070,"Moreover, in vitro incubation of heat-inactivated S. aureus with splenocytes isolated from MAP27-immunized mice stimulated the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A/F."
9071,"Our findings demonstrated that MAP27, as a thymus-dependent antigen, is efficient at eliciting T cell-mediated responses to protect mice from S. aureus infection."
9072,This study sheds light on a possible strategy to design vaccines against S. aureus.
9073," Recombinant severe acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV) variants lacking the group specific genes 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b (rSARS-CoV-Δ[6–9b]), the structural gene E (rSARS-CoV-ΔE), and a combination of both sets of genes (rSARS-CoV-Δ[E,6–9b]) have been generated."
9074,"All these viruses were rescued in monkey (Vero E6) cells and were also infectious for human (Huh-7, Huh7.5.1 and CaCo-2) cell lines and for transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), indicating that none of these proteins is essential for the viral cycle."
9075,"Furthermore, in Vero E6 cells, all the viruses showed the formation of particles with the same morphology as the wt virus, indicating that these proteins do not have a high impact in the final morphology of the virions."
9076,"Nevertheless, in the absence of E protein, release of virus particles efficacy was reduced."
9077,"Viruses lacking E protein grew about 100-fold lower than the wt virus in lungs of Tg infected mice but did not grow in the brains of the same animals, in contrast to the rSARS-CoV-Δ[6–9b] virus, which grew almost as well as the wt in both tissues."
9078,"Viruses lacking E protein were highly attenuated in the highly sensitive hACE-2 Tg mice, in contrast to the minimal rSARS-CoV-Δ[6–9b] and wt viruses."
9079,"These data indicate that E gene might be a virulence factor influencing replication level, tissue tropism and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, suggesting that ΔE attenuated viruses are promising vaccine candidates."
9080,The 2015 emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas brought new attention to this previously obscure virus.
9081,Experimental model systems have been instrumental in rapidly advancing our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis.
9082,"Here, Lazear looks back on the events leading to the development of the ZIKV mouse model reported in Cell Host & Microbe."
9083," A new disease, the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged at the beginning of 2003 and rapidly spread throughout the world."
9084,Although the disease had disappeared in June 2003 its re-emergence cannot be excluded.
9085,The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV may take years.
9086,"Therefore, the availability of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV may be crucial for the control of future SARS outbreaks."
9087,"In this review, experimental and clinical data about potential anti-SARS drugs is summarised and discussed."
9088,Animal model studies will be needed to help to determine which interventions warrant controlled clinical testing.
9089,ABSTRACT Crossbred calves (n=350; average BW 240±1kg) were obtained from regional livestock auctions.
9090,"Within each set (block, n=4), calves were stratified by BW and arrival sex into 1 of 8, 0.42-ha pens (10 to 12 calves per pen)."
9091,"Pens were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatments consisting of supplemental Zn (360mg/d), Mn (200mg/d), and Cu (125mg/d) from inorganic (zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, and copper sulfate; n=2 pens per block), organic (zinc amino acid complex, manganese amino acid complex, and copper amino acid complex; Availa-4, Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie, MN; n=3 pens per block), and hydroxy (IntelliBond Z, IntelliBond C, and IntelliBond M; Micronutrients, Indianapolis, IN; n=3 pens per block) sources."
9092,During the 42- to 45-d backgrounding period calves had ad libitum access to bermudagrass hay and were fed corn and dried distillers grain–based supplements that served as carrier for the treatments.
9093,"After removal of data for chronic (n=6) and deceased (n=1) calves, trace-mineral source had no effect on final or intermediate BW (P=0.86) or ADG (P≥0.24)."
9094,"With all data included in the analysis, dietary treatments had no effect on the number treated once (P=0.93), twice (P=0.71), or 3 times (P=0.53) for bovine respiratory disease or on the number of calves classified as chronic (P=0.55)."
9095,"Based on these results, trace-mineral source had no effect on total BW gain, ADG, or morbidity during the receiving phase in shipping-stressed cattle."
9096,Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an Alphavirus that causes chronic and incapacitating arthralgia in humans.
9097,"Although patient cohort studies have shown the production of CHIKV specific antibodies, the fine specificity of the antibody response against CHIKV is not completely defined."
9098,The macaque model of CHIKV infection was established due to limitations of clinical specimens.
9099,"More importantly, its close relation to humans will allow the study of chronic infection and further identify important CHIKV targets."
9100,"In this study, serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques collected at different time-points post infection were used to characterize the antibody production pattern and kinetics."
9101,"Results revealed that anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing and the E2 glycoprotein, Capsid, nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins were targets of the anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques."
9102,"Furthermore, linear B-cell epitopes recognized by these anti-CHIKV antibodies were identified, and mapped to their structural localization."
9103,This characterizes the specificity of anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques and further demonstrates the importance of the different regions in CHIKV-encoded proteins in the adaptive immune response.
9104,"Information from this study provides critical knowledge that will aid in the understanding of CHIKV infection and immunity, vaccine design, and pre-clinical efficacy studies."
9105,Animal Health Ireland has produced clear guidelines for the control of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) infection in Irish cattle herds.
9106,In the course of developing these guidelines it was clear that a framework for regional and/or national BVD control would be required to increase the uptake of BVD control at farm level and reduce the overall prevalence of the disease.
9107,"This paper assessed the economic impact of BVD, epidemiological aspects of the disease to its control, models of BVD control, international experiences of BVD control programmes."
9108,The technical knowledge and test technology exists to eradicate BVD.
9109,"Indeed, many countries have successfully and others are embarking on control of the disease."
9110,The identification and prompt elimination of PI cattle will form the basis of any control programme.
9111,The trade of such animals must be curtailed.
9112,Pregnant and potentially pregnant carrying PI foetuses pose a significant threat.
9113,"International experience indicates systematic, well coordinated programmes have the most success, while voluntary programmes can make good initial progress but ultimately fail."
9114,"The farming community must buy into any proposed programme, and without their support, failure is likely."
9115,"To buy into the programme and create such a demand for BVD control, farmers must first be well informed."
9116,It is likely that stemming economic loss and improving productivity will be the primary motivator at individual farm level.
9117, The Global Virus Network (GVN) was established in 2011 to strengthen research and responses to emerging viral causes of human disease and to prepare against new viral pandemics.
9118,There are now 52 GVN Centers of Excellence and 9 Affiliate laboratories in 32 countries.
9119,"The 11th International GVN meeting was held from June 9–11, 2019 in Barcelona, Spain and was jointly organized with the Spanish Society of Virology."
9120,A common theme throughout the meeting was globalization and climate change.
9121,"This report highlights the recent accomplishments of GVN researchers in several important areas of medical virology, including severe virus epidemics, anticipation and preparedness for changing disease dynamics, host-pathogen interactions, zoonotic virus infections, ethical preparedness for epidemics and pandemics, one health and antivirals."
9122,Genome organization and structural aspects of the SARS-related virus
9123," Using an established nonhuman primate model for H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus infection in humans, we have been able to demonstrate the prophylactic mitigation of the pulmonary damage characteristic of human fatal cases from primary influenza virus pneumonia with a low dose oral formulation of a commercially available parenteral natural human interferon alpha (Alferon N Injection®)."
9124,At the highest oral dose (62.5IU/kg body weight) used there was a marked reduction in the alveolar inflammatory response with minor evidence of alveolar and interstitial edema in contrast to the hemorrhage and inflammatory response observed in the alveoli of control animals.
9125,The mitigation of severe damage to the lower pulmonary airway was observed without a parallel reduction in viral titers.
9126,Clinical trial data will be necessary to establish its prophylactic human efficacy for highly pathogenic influenza viruses.
9127,"A novel lineage C betacoronavirus, originally named human coronavirus EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC) and recently renamed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), that is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5, which we discovered in 2007 from bats in Hong Kong, has recently emerged in the Middle East to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like infection in humans."
9128,"The first laboratory-confirmed case, which involved a 60-year-old man from Bisha, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), who died of rapidly progressive community-acquired pneumonia and acute renal failure, was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on September 23, 2012."
9129,"Since then, a total of 70 cases, including 39 fatalities, have been reported in the Middle East and Europe."
9130,"Recent clusters involving epidemiologically-linked household contacts and hospital contacts in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa strongly suggested possible human-to-human transmission."
9131,"Clinical and laboratory research data generated in the past few months have provided new insights into the possible animal reservoirs, transmissibility, and virulence of MERS-CoV, and the optimal laboratory diagnostic options and potential antiviral targets for MERS-CoV-associated infection."
9132,Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flaviviridae family that has been known to circulate for decades causing mild febrile illness.
9133,The more recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health.
9134,New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired.
9135,In this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZIKV cDNA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZIKV in vivo.
9136,A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice.
9137,Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice.
9138,The rZIKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice.
9139,"Interestingly, infectious rZIKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZIKV cDNA in the absence of transfection reagent."
9140,"Further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDNA clone encoding an attenuated rZIKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZIKV challenge."
9141,This novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems.
9142,"Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future."
9143,This chapter provides a brief summary of issues surrounding the utilization of nonhuman primates in biomedical research.
9144,"Although a relatively small proportion of the total number of animals utilized in biomedical research, nonhuman primates occupy a unique position as the species most closely related to humans, and thus have the potential to provide highly relevant information regarding human health issues."
9145,"Nonhuman primates are utilized across a wide diversity of research topics and examples are provided including infectious disease, neuroscience, and genomics."
9146,"Pertinent information relating to ethical issues, species selection, housing, and specific pathogen-free status are provided as an overview of relevant issues associated with selection of nonhuman primate models."
9147,Selected references are provided as a reference for more comprehensive information relating to these topics.
9148,"In this era of continued emergence of zoonotic virus infections, the rapid development of rodent models represents a critical barrier to public health preparedness, including the testing of antivirus therapy and vaccines."
9149,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was recently identified as the causative agent of a severe pneumonia.
9150,"Given the ability of coronavirus to rapidly adapt to new hosts, a major public health concern is that MERS-CoV will further adapt to replication in humans, triggering a pandemic."
9151,"No small-animal model for this infection is currently available, but studies suggest that virus entry factors can confer virus susceptibility."
9152,"Here, we show that mice were sensitized to MERS-CoV infection by prior transduction with adenoviral vectors expressing the human host-cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4."
9153,Mice developed a pneumonia characterized by extensive inflammatory-cell infiltration with virus clearance occurring 6–8 d after infection.
9154,Clinical disease and histopathological changes were more severe in the absence of type-I IFN signaling whereas the T-cell response was required for virus clearance.
9155,"Using these mice, we demonstrated the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention (poly I:C) and a potential vaccine [Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles expressing MERS-CoV spike protein]."
9156,We also found little protective cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV.
9157,Our results demonstrate that this system will be useful for MERS-CoV studies and for the rapid development of relevant animal models for emerging respiratory viral infections.
9158,Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRVs) cause mild respiratory disease of cattle.
9159,"In this study, a near full-length genome sequence of a virus named RS3X (formerly classified as bovine rhinovirus type 1), isolated from infected cattle from the UK in the 1960s, was obtained and analyzed."
9160,"Compared to other closely related Aphthoviruses, major differences were detected in the leader protease (L(pro)), P1, 2B, and 3A proteins."
9161,Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RS3X was a member of the species bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV).
9162,"Using different codon-based and branch-site selection models for Aphthoviruses, including BRAV RS3X and foot-and-mouth disease virus, we observed no clear evidence for genomic regions undergoing positive selection."
9163,"However, within each of the BRV species, multiple sites under positive selection were detected."
9164,"The results also suggest that the probability (determined by Recombination Detection Program) for recombination events between BRVs and other Aphthoviruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus was not significant."
9165,"In contrast, within BRVs, the probability of recombination increases."
9166,The data reported here provide genetic information to assist in the identification of diagnostic signatures and research tools for BRAV.
9167,Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans.
9168,"However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations."
9169,This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders.
9170,"In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses."
9171,"For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species."
9172,"We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also these emerging coronaviral diseases."
9173,Numerous viruses are able to cause respiratory tract infections.
9174,"With the availability of new molecular techniques, the number of pathogens detected in specimens from the human respiratory tract has increased."
9175,Some of these viral infections have the potential to lead to severe systemic disease.
9176,Other viruses are limited to playing a role in the pathogenesis of the common cold syndrome.
9177,This chapter focuses on the viral pathogens that are linked to common cold.
9178,It is not the intention to comprehensively review all the viruses that are able to cause respiratory tract infections—this would go beyond the scope of this book.
9179,"The list of viruses that are briefly reviewed here includes rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus."
9180,Bocavirus is discussed as one example of a newly identified pathogen with a less established role in the etiology and pathogenesis of common cold.
9181,Influenza virus does not cause what is defined as common cold.
9182,"However, influenza viruses are associated with respiratory disease and the clinical picture of mild influenza and common cold frequently overlaps."
9183,"Therefore, influenza virus has been included in this chapter."
9184,It is important to note that a number of viruses are frequently co-detected with other viruses in humans with respiratory diseases.
9185,"Therefore, the viral etiology and the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of common cold is complex, and numberous questions remain to be answered."
9186, Associations between heifer calf management and mortality were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983.
9187,"At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year."
9188,The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated.
9189,"At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices."
9190,Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer.
9191,Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies.
9192,"Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens."
9193,A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality.
9194,"At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying."
9195,"However, several interactions entered the statistical models, and the effects of those management practices were not all straightforward."
9196,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an ideal example for developing One Health concepts.
9197,Dromedary camels are the principal reservoir for the virus.
9198,"Infected camels shed the virus in body secretions, particularly nasal discharges."
9199,MERS-CoV has the potential to remain active in the environment for some time under optimum conditions of temperature and humidity.
9200,This shedding sustains the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camels is considered a major risk factor for human infection.
9201,Reducing virus shedding from camels will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection.
9202,"Our main objective is to highlight the potential aspects of reducing virus shedding from camels to the environment, thereby reducing the possibility of human infection."
9203,"We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV."
9204," During pathogenesis, viruses come in contact with the microbiota that colonizes the mucosal sites they infect."
9205,The intestinal microbiota has emerged as a critical factor in intestinal viral susceptibility.
9206,"While the interaction of virus-intestinal commensal bacteria can lead to enhanced or decreased viral infection capacity, several scientific studies support the use of probiotics as antiviral therapies."
9207,"Thus, probiotics and the modulation of the intestinal microbiota are envisaged as therapeutic strategies in the prevention and treatment of viral infection."
9208,Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly described paramyxovirus that is an important cause of acute respiratory tract disease.
9209,"We undertook to develop a small animal model of hMPV infection, pathogenesis, and protection."
9210,"Hamsters, guinea pigs, cotton rats, and nine inbred strains of mice were inoculated intranasally with hMPV."
9211,"The animals were sacrificed, and nasal and lung tissue virus yields were determined by plaque titration."
9212,None of the animals exhibited respiratory symptoms.
9213,The quantity of virus present in the nasal tissue ranged from 4.6 × 10(2) PFU/gram tissue (C3H mice) to greater than 10(5) PFU/gram (hamster).
9214,"The amount of virus in the lungs was considerably less than in nasal tissue in each species tested, ranging from undetectable (<5 PFU/g; guinea pigs) to 1.8 × 10(5) PFU/gram (cotton rat)."
9215,The peak virus titer in cotton rat lungs occurred on day 4 postinfection.
9216,hMPV-infected cotton rat lungs examined on day 4 postinfection exhibited histopathological changes consisting of peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates.
9217,Immunohistochemical staining detected virus only at the luminal surfaces of respiratory epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract.
9218,hMPV-infected cotton rats mounted virus-neutralizing antibody responses and were partially protected against virus shedding and lung pathology on subsequent rechallenge with hMPV.
9219,Viral antigen was undetectable in the lungs on challenge of previously infected animals.
9220,This study demonstrates that the cotton rat is a permissive small animal model of hMPV infection that exhibits lung histopathology associated with infection and that primary infection protected animals against subsequent infection.
9221,This model will allow further in vivo studies of hMPV pathogenesis and evaluation of vaccine candidates.
9222,: Peyer’s patches (PPs) can be considered as the immune site of the intestine.
9223,"Within PPs, Dendritic cells (DCs) can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium, and process it and then present to lymphocytes, which effectively antigen produces an immune response."
9224,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease."
9225,The interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) has been reported.
9226,"However, little is known about the interaction between inactivated PEDV and DCs in porcine PPs."
9227,"RESULTS: In this study, for the first time we investigated the role of DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration inactivated PEDV."
9228,"Firstly, a method to isolate DCs from porcine PPs was established, in which the purity of SWC3a(+)/MHC-II(+) DCs was more than 90%."
9229,"Our findings clearly indicate that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also secreted cytokines (IL-1, IL-4)."
9230,"Furthermore, the number of DCs and IgA(+) cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated PEDV."
9231,CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that oral administration of inactivated PEDV activate DCs in porcine Peyer’s patches and inactivated PEDV may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity.
9232,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was characterized by high mortality rates in the elderly.
9233,"The molecular mechanisms that govern enhanced susceptibility of elderly populations are not known, and robust animal models are needed that recapitulate the increased pathogenic phenotype noted with increasing age."
9234,"Using synthetic biology and reverse genetics, we describe the construction of a panel of isogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains bearing variant spike glycoproteins that are representative of zoonotic strains found in palm civets and raccoon dogs, as well as isolates spanning the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS-CoV epidemic."
9235,The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sensitivities to neutralization with antibodies.
9236,"The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains."
9237,"All viruses replicated efficiently, but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals."
9238,"In contrast, severe clinical disease, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, alveolitis, and death were noted in 12-month-old mice inoculated with the palm civet HC/SZ/61/03 strain or early-human-phase GZ02 variants but not with related middle- and late-phase epidemic or raccoon dog strains."
9239,This panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing zoonotic and human epidemic spike glycoproteins will provide heterologous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoonotic reintroductions as well as provide the appropriate model system for elucidating the complex virus-host interactions that contribute to more-severe and fatal SARS-CoV disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly.
9240,"In the present study, we have generated a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) named Sal-06 by using the crude outer membrane protein preparation of Salmonella enteric subsp."
9241,enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain as antigen.
9242,"Sal-06mAb belonging to IgG1 isotype demonstrated broad cross-reactivity to standard and isolated strains of genus Salmonella and others such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis."
9243,Cross-reactivity across several bacterial genera indicated that the epitopes reactive to Sal-06mAb are conserved among these members.
9244,Neutralizing effects of Sal-06mAb on Salmonella growth and survival was evaluated in vitro using bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity with and without complement and bacterial invasion inhibition assay.
9245,Sal-06mAb demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain which is both time and concentration (of mAb) dependent.
9246,It was also found that the bacterial growth inhibition was complement independent.
9247,"When the bacterial cells were preincubated with Sal-06mAb, it reduced the adherence and invasion of bacterial cells into A549 epithelial cell line."
9248,"This was confirmed by CFU count analysis, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy."
9249,Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging confirmed the antimicrobial effects of Sal-06mAb on S. typhimurium ATCC 14028.
9250,The development of broadly reactive and cross protective Sal-06mAb opens new possibilities for immunotherapy of sepsis caused by Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae members.
9251, Coronaviruses are a hot research topic because they can cause severe diseases in humans and animals.
9252,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belonging to gamma-coronaviruses, causes a highly infectious respiratory viral disease and can result in catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide."
9253,"Unfortunately, the genetic basis of the host immune responses against IBV is poorly understood."
9254,"In the present study, the antibody levels against IBV post-immunization were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 511 individuals from a commercial chicken (Gallus gallus) population."
9255,"A genome-wide association study using 43,211 single nucleotide polymorphism markers was performed to identify the major loci affecting the immune response against IBV."
9256,This study detected 20 significant (P <1.16×10−6) effect single nucleotide polymorphisms for the antibody level against IBV.
9257,"These single nucleotide polymorphisms were distributed on five chicken chromosomes (GGA), involving GGA1, GGA3, GGA5, GGA8, and GGA9."
9258,"The genes in the 1-Mb windows surrounding each single nucleotide polymorphism with significant effect for the antibody level against IBV were associated with many biological processes or pathways related to immunity, such as the defense response and mTOR signaling pathway."
9259,A genomic region containing a cluster of 13 beta-defensin (GAL1–13) and interleukin-17F genes on GGA3 probably plays an important role in the immune response against IBV.
9260,"In addition, the major loci significantly associated with the antibody level against IBV on GGA1 and GGA5 could explain about 12% and 13% of the phenotypic variation, respectively."
9261,"This study suggested that the chicken genome has several important loci affecting the immune response against IBV, and increases our knowledge of how to control outbreaks of infectious bronchitis."
9262," Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a highly contagious Paramyxovirus that infects most children by age two, generating an estimated 75,000–125,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. annually."
9263,"hRSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants and children under 1year of age, with significant mortality among high-risk groups."
9264,"A regulatory agency-approved vaccine is not available, and existing prophylaxis and therapies are limited to use in high-risk pediatric patients; thus additional therapies are sorely needed."
9265,"Here, we identify a series of benzimidazole analogs that inhibit hRSV infection in vitro with high potency, using a previously-reported high-throughput screening assay."
9266,"The lead compound, SRI 29365 (1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3-yl]methyl-1H-benzimidazole), has an EC50 of 66μM and a selectivity >50."
9267,We identified additional compounds with varying potencies by testing commercially-available chemical analogs.
9268,Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRI 29365 effectively inhibits viral replication only if present during the early stages of viral infection.
9269,We isolated a virus with resistance to SRI 29365 and identified mutations in the transmembrane domain of the viral G protein genomic sequence that suggested that the compound inhibits G-protein mediated attachment of hRSV to cells.
9270,Additional experiments with multiple cell types indicated that SRI 29365 antiviral activity correlates with the binding of cell surface heparin by full-length G protein.
9271,"Lastly, SRI 29365 did not reduce hRSV titers or morbidity/mortality in efficacy studies using a cotton rat model."
9272,"Although SRI 29365 and analogs inhibit hRSV replication in vitro, this work suggests that the G-protein may not be a valid drug target in vivo."
9273,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide and leads to serious pathological sequelae in the upper genital tract (UGT) including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility."
9274,Several components of the host immune responses have been shown to contribute to the UGT pathology following genital chlamydial infection.
9275,We have shown recently that CD8(+) T cells induce the chlamydial UGT pathology via the production of TNF-α.
9276,"However, those studies did not determine whether the pathology is mediated by bystander or antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells."
9277,"In this study, we compared chlamydial clearance and UGT pathology in OT-1 transgenic mice and the corresponding C57BL/6J wild type mice following primary intravaginal C. muridarum infection."
9278,All CD8(+) T cells in the OT-1 mice respond only to the Ova 257–264 peptide and are incapable of responding to other antigenic epitopes including those of Chlamydia.
9279,OT-1 mice displayed vaginal chlamydial clearance comparable to the wild type animals.
9280,"However, both oviduct and uterine horn pathology were minimal in the OT-1 mice compared to the high degree of pathology observed in the wild type animals."
9281,"These results strongly suggest that Chlamydia-specific, not bystander, CD8(+) T cells mediate the UGT pathological sequelae following genital chlamydial infection."
9282,"Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that are distributed worldwide."
9283,"They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), many of which seriously endanger human health and well-being."
9284,"Only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses harbor nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), which performs multiple functions in inhibiting antiviral host responses."
9285,"The role of the C terminus of betacoronavirus nsp1 in virulence has been characterized, but the location of the alphacoronavirus nsp1 region that is important for virulence remains unclear."
9286,"Here, using TGEV nsp1 as a model to explore the function of this protein in alphacoronaviruses, we demonstrate that alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibits host gene expression."
9287,"Solving the crystal structure of full-length TGEV at 1.85-Å resolution and conducting several biochemical analyses, we observed that a specific motif (amino acids 91–95) of alphacoronavirus nsp1 is a conserved region that inhibits host protein synthesis."
9288,"Using a reverse-genetics system based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology to construct a recombinant TGEV in which this specific nsp1 motif was altered, we found that this mutation does not affect virus replication in cell culture but significantly reduces TGEV pathogenicity in pigs."
9289,"Taken together, our findings suggest that alphacoronavirus nsp1 is an essential virulence determinant, providing a potential paradigm for the development of a new attenuated vaccine based on modified nsp1."
9290," RLadyBug is an S4 package for the simulation, visualization and estimation of stochastic epidemic models in R. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference can be performed to estimate the parameters in a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, which is a stochastic model for describing a single outbreak of an infectious disease."
9291,"The package is thus one step towards statistical software supporting parameter estimation, calculation of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for transmission models."
9292,"Due to a dramatic increase in life expectancy, the number of individuals aged 65 and older is rapidly rising."
9293,This presents considerable challenges to our health care system since advanced age is associated with a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases due to immune senescence.
9294,"However, the mechanisms underlying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely understood."
9295,Advancement in our comprehension of mechanisms of immune senescence and development of interventions to improve health span requires animal models that closely recapitulate the physiological changes that occur with aging in humans.
9296,"Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are invaluable preclinical models to study the underlying causal mechanism of pathogenesis due to their outbred nature, high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans, and their susceptibility to human pathogens."
9297,"In this chapter, we review NHP models available for biogerontology research, advantages and challenges they present, and advances they facilitated."
9298,"Furthermore, we emphasize the utility of NHPs in characterizing immune senescence, evaluating interventions to reverse aging of the immune system, and development of vaccine strategies that are better suited for this vulnerable population."
9299,Bacterial super-infections contribute to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and other respiratory virus infections.
9300,There are robust animal model data but only limited clinical information on the effectiveness of licensed antiviral agents for the treatment of bacterial complications of influenza.
9301,The association of secondary bacterial pathogens with fatal pneumonia during the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic highlights the need for new development in this area.
9302,Basic and clinical research into viral-bacterial interactions over the last decade has revealed several mechanisms that underlie this synergism.
9303,"By applying these insights to antiviral drug development, the potential exists to improve outcomes by means other than direct inhibition of the virus."
9304,Human Monoclonal Antibodies Against HIV and Emerging Viruses
9305,The domestic or European ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has been domesticated for thousands of years.
9306,"Ferrets have been used for hunting and fur production, as pets, and as models in biomedical research."
9307,"Despite the relatively small numbers used in the laboratory, ferrets have some unique applications including study of human influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus."
9308,"They have served as models for peptic ulcer disease, carotenoid metabolism, cystic fibrosis, and drug emesis screening, among others."
9309,"Most research ferrets are males, due to estrus-related health problems in females."
9310,They may be housed conventionally and are easy to care for when their biology and behavior are understood.
9311,"Due to the small number of ferret suppliers, animals are often shipped long distances, requiring air transport and intermediate handlers."
9312,"It is important to minimize shipment stress, especially with weanling and pregnant animals."
9313,Additional expertise is required for success with pregnant and whelping ferrets and for rearing of neonates.
9314,"The animals have specific dietary requirements, and proper nutrition is key."
9315,"Successful housing requires knowledge of ferret behaviors including social behavior, eating habits, a general inquisitive nature, and a species-typical need to burrow and hide."
9316,Regular handling is necessary to maintain well-being.
9317,"A ferret health care program consists of physical examination, immunization, clinical pathology, and a working knowledge of common ferret diseases."
9318,"Various research methodologies have been described, from basic procedures such as blood collection to major invasive survival surgery."
9319,Ferrets have a distinct niche in biomedical research and are hardy animals that thrive well in the laboratory.
9320,Is Virology Dead?
9321,The infection of epithelia] swine testicle and intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-1) cell lines by adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) has been studied in vitro by using an Ad5-luciferase recombinant containing the firefly luciferase gene as a reporter.
9322,"Porcine cell lines supported Ad5 replication, showing virus titers, kinetics of virus production, and luciferase expression levels similar to those obtained in human 293 cells, which constitutively express the 5'-end 11% of the Ad5 genome."
9323,The tropism of Ad5-based vectors in swine and its ability to induce an efficient immune response against heterologous antigens expressed by foreign genes inserted in these vectors has been determined.
9324,Ad5 vectors replicate and express heterologous antigens in porcine lungs and mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes.
9325,"Significant levels of heterologous antigen expression were also demonstrated in the small intestine (jejunum and ileum), but Ad5 replication in this organ was very poor, suggesting that Ad vectors undergo an abortive replication in the porcine small intestine."
9326,The tissues infected by Ad5 were dependent on the inoculation route.
9327,"The oronasal route appeared to be best for inoculation of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue infection, while the intraperitoneal route was best for gut-associated lymphoid tissue infection."
9328,"Epithelial cells of bronchioles, macrophages, type II pneumocytes, and follicular dendritic cells were identified as targets for Ad5, while epithelial cells of the intestine were not infected by Ad5."
9329,"Viruses with a deletion from 79.5 to 84.8 map units in the E3 region, with or without heterologous inserted genes, replicated to lower levels in porcine tissues than did wild-type Ad5."
9330,"It was also shown that an Ad5 recombinant expressing the four antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) spike protein induced in swine immune responses which neutralized TGEV infectivity."
9331,"In addition, porcine serum from Ad-TGEV-immune animals provide passive protection when mixed with fully virulent TGEV and orally administered to highly susceptible newborn piglets."
9332,These results taken together indicate that swine may be a good animal model for human Ad5 lung infection to aid in the evaluation of candidate adenovirus vaccines and that Ad5 may be suitable as a recombinant viral vaccine or for other applications in swine.
9333,Neonatal calves possess a very immature and naïve immune system and are reliant on the intake of maternal colostrum for passive transfer of immunoglobulins.
9334,Variation in colostrum management of beef and dairy calves is thought to affect early immune development.
9335,"Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine changes in gene expression and investigate molecular pathways involved in the immune-competence development of neonatal Holstein dairy calves and naturally suckled beef calves using next generation RNA-sequencing during the first week of life."
9336,Jugular whole blood samples were collected from Holstein (H) dairy calves (n = 8) artificially fed 5% B.W.
9337,"colostrum, and from beef calves which were the progenies of Charolais-Limousin (CL; n = 7) and Limousin-Friesian beef suckler cows (LF; n = 7), for subsequent RNA isolation."
9338,"In dairy calves, there was a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression possibly due to the stress of separation from the dam."
9339,"LF calves exhibited early signs of humoral immune development with observed increases in the expression genes coding for Ig receptors, which was not evident in the other breeds by 7 days of age."
9340,"Immune and health related DEGs identified as upregulated in beef calves are prospective contender genes for the classification of biomarkers for immune-competence development, and will contribute towards a greater understanding of the development of an immune response in neonatal calves."
9341,Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract.
9342,"The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds."
9343,"Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates."
9344,"To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed."
9345,"Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model."
9346,Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli.
9347,These organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines.
9348,"Additionally, the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals."
9349,"No commercial vaccine is available but various effective antivirals have been identified, some with potential for human treatment."
9350,"These morphological airway cultures are also well suited for the identification of antivirals, evaluation of compound toxicity and viral inhibition."
9351,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new, highly contagious, viral disease, emerged in China late in 2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries and regions causing in excess of 774 deaths and 8098 infections worldwide."
9352,"In the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, therapy or vaccine, isolation of individuals diagnosed with SARS and quarantine of individuals feared exposed to SARS virus were used to control the spread of infection."
9353,"We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing using a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS-related deaths in the first three regions but not in Beijing until mid-April, when China started to report data more accurately."
9354,The results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the latter is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks with or without quarantine.
9355,An optimal isolation programme entails timely implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical threshold value.
9356,"Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above are associated with the incidence of new community outbreaks or nosocomial infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region."
9357,Allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub-optimal isolation and quarantine together.
9358,A community-wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry.
9359, The aim of the present study was to carry out molecular epidemiological investigation on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K99 and Salmonella spp.
9360,in diarrheic neonatal calves.
9361,Fecal samples were obtained from 220 diarrheic calves at 9 farms related to four governorates in central and northern Egypt.
9362,E. coli and Salmonella spp.
9363,isolates were examined for E. coli K99 and Salmonella spp.
9364,using PCR.
9365,"ETEC K99 was recovered from 20 (10.36 %) out of 193 isolates, whereas Salmonella spp."
9366,was recovered from nine calves (4.09%).
9367,Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with both infections.
9368,"ETEC K99 was significantly affected by age (P <0.01; OR: 1.812; CI 95%: 0.566–1.769), colostrum feeding practice (P <0.01; OR: 5.525; CI 95%: 2.025–15.076), rotavirus infection (P <0.001; OR: 2.220; CI 95%: 0.273–1.251), vaccination of pregnant dams with combined vaccine against rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli (K99) (P <0.001; OR: 4.753; CI 95%: 2.124–10.641), and vitamin E and selenium administration to the pregnant dam (P <0.01; OR: 3.933; CI 95%: 0.703–1.248)."
9369,Infection with Salmonella spp.
9370,"was found to be significantly affected by the animal age (P <0.05; OR: 0.376; CI 95%: 0.511–1.369), Hygiene (P <0.05; OR: 0.628; CI 95%: 1.729–5.612), and region (P <0."
9371,01; OR: 0.970; CI 95%: 0.841–1.624).
9372,"The results of the present study indicate the importance of PCR as rapid, effective and reliable tool for screening of ETEC and Salmonella spp."
9373,when confronted with cases of undifferentiated calf diarrhea.
9374,"Moreover, identification of the risk factors associated with the spreading of bacteria causing diarrhea may be helpful for construction of suitable methods for prevention and control."
9375,"Coronaviruses comprise a large group of emergent human and animal pathogens, including the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains that cause significant morbidity and mortality in infected individuals, especially the elderly."
9376,"As emergent viruses may cause episodic outbreaks of disease over time, human samples are limited."
9377,Systems biology and genetic technologies maximize opportunities for identifying critical host and viral genetic factors that regulate susceptibility and virus-induced disease severity.
9378,"These approaches provide discovery platforms that highlight and allow targeted confirmation of critical targets for prophylactics and therapeutics, especially critical in an outbreak setting."
9379,"Although poorly understood, it has long been recognized that host regulation of virus-associated disease severity is multigenic."
9380,The advent of systems genetic and biology resources provides new opportunities for deconvoluting the complex genetic interactions and expression networks that regulate pathogenic or protective host response patterns following virus infection.
9381,"Using SARS-CoV as a model, dynamic transcriptional network changes and disease-associated phenotypes have been identified in different genetic backgrounds, leading to the promise of population-wide discovery of the underpinnings of Coronavirus pathogenesis."
9382,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with abnormal inflammatory response and airflow limitation.
9383,"Acute exacerbation involves increased inflammatory burden leading to worsening respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea and sputum production."
9384,Some COPD patients have frequent exacerbations (two or more exacerbations per year).
9385,A substantial proportion of COPD patients may remain stable without exacerbation.
9386,Bacterial and viral infections are the most common causative factors that breach airway stability and lead to exacerbation.
9387,"The increasing prevalence of exacerbation is associated with deteriorating lung function, hospitalization, and risk of death."
9388,"In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of airway inflammation in COPD and discuss how bacterial or viral infection, temperature, air pollution, eosinophilic inflammation, and concomitant chronic diseases increase airway inflammation and the risk of exacerbation."
9389, Respiratory immunization is an attractive way to generate systemic and mucosal protective memory responses that are required for preventing mucosally transmitted infections.
9390,"However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms for controlling memory T cell responses remain incompletely understood."
9391,"In this study, we investigated the role of respiratory macrophage (MΦ) in regulating CD4 T cell responses to recombinant adenovirus-based (rAd) vaccines."
9392,We demonstrated that rAd intranasal (i.n.)
9393,vaccination induced migration and accumulation of respiratory MΦ and circulatory monocytes in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung parenchyma.
9394,"Under the influence of respiratory MΦ CD4 T cells exhibited slow proliferation kinetics and an increased tendency of generating central memory, as opposed to effector memory, CD4 T cell responses in vitro and in vivo."
9395,"Correspondingly, depletion of MΦ using clodronate-containing liposome prior to i.n."
9396,"immunization significantly enhanced CD4 T cell proliferation and increased the frequency of CD4 memory T cells in the airway lumen, demonstrating that MΦ initially serve as a negative regulator in limiting generation of mucosal tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells."
9397,"However, clodronate-containing liposome delivery following i.n."
9398,"immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of memory CD4 T cells in the airway lumen and spleen, indicating that respiratory MΦ and potentially circulating monocytes are critically required for maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells."
9399,"Collectively, our data demonstrate that rAd-induced mucosal CD4 T memory responses are regulated by respiratory MΦ and/or monocytes at multiple stages."
9400,: There is a continued need for strategies to prevent influenza.
9401,"While cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has an extensive antimicrobial spectrum, its ability to affect respiratory viruses has not been studied in detail."
9402,"OBJECTIVES: Here, we evaluate the ability of CPC to disrupt influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo."
9403,METHODS: The virucidal activity of CPC was evaluated against susceptible and oseltamivir- resistant strains of influenza viruses.
9404,The effective virucidal concentration (EC) of CPC was determined using a hemagglutination assay and tissue culture infective dose assay.
9405,The effect of CPC on viral envelope morphology and ultrastructure was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
9406,The ability of influenza virus to develop resistance was evaluated after multiple passaging in sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC.
9407,"Finally, the efficacy of CPC in formulation to prevent and treat influenza infection was evaluated using the PR8 murine influenza model."
9408,"RESULTS: The virucidal effect of CPC occurred within 10 minutes, with mean EC(50) and EC(2log) ranging between 5 to 20 μg/mL, for most strains of influenza tested regardless of type and resistance to oseltamivir."
9409,Examinations using TEM showed that CPC disrupted the integrity of the viral envelope and its morphology.
9410,Influenza viruses demonstrated no resistance to CPC despite prolonged exposure.
9411,Treated mice exhibited significantly increased survival and maintained body weight compared to untreated mice.
9412,CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial agent CPC possesses virucidal activity against susceptible and resistant strains of influenza virus by targeting and disrupting the viral envelope.
9413,Substantial virucidal activity is seen even at very low concentrations of CPC without development of resistance.
9414,"Moreover, CPC in formulation reduces influenza-associated mortality and morbidity in vivo."
9415, Occurrence of influenza pandemics is a worldwide phenomenon and a significant cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the globe.
9416,It is due to mutations in the influenza virus genetic material creating antigenic drift of pathogenic viral proteins resulting in emergence of new influenza virus strains.
9417,"Therefore, the vaccines available for prevention of influenza offer no protection against influenza pandemics caused by new virus strains."
9418,"Moreover, the existing drugs used to combat influenza may be ineffective to treat influenza pandemics due to the emergence of drug resistance in the pandemic virus strain."
9419,"Therefore, a working strategy must be developed to combat influenza pandemics."
9420,In this review we have addressed this problem and reviewed the published studies on ascorbic acid in the common cold and influenza and laboratory studies on the effect of ascorbic acid on influenza virus.
9421,We have also correlated the clinical and laboratory studies and developed a hypothesis to prevent influenza pandemics.
9422, The origins and evolutionary history of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remain an issue of uncertainty and debate.
9423,"Based on evolutionary analyses of coronavirus DNA sequences, encompassing an approximately 13kb stretch of the SARS-TOR2 genome, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV has a recombinant history with lineages of types I and III coronavirus."
9424,"We identified a minimum of five recombinant regions ranging from 83 to 863bp in length and including the polymerase, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp14."
9425,"Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of viral host jumping events, concomitant with the reassortment of bird and mammalian coronaviruses, a scenario analogous to earlier outbreaks of influenzae."
9426, An acute and often severe respiratory illness emerged in southern China in late 2002 and rapidly spread to different areas of the Far East as well as several countries around the globe.
9427,"When the outbreak of this apparently novel infectious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) came to an end in July 2003, it had caused over 8000 probable cases worldwide and more than 700 deaths."
9428,"Starting in March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) organised an unprecedented international effort by leading laboratories working together to find the causative agent."
9429,"Little more than one week later, three research groups from this WHO-coordinated network simultaneously found evidence of a hitherto unknown coronavirus in SARS patients, using different approaches."
9430,"After Koch’s postulates had been fulfilled, WHO officially declared on 16 April 2003 that this virus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS."
9431,"Ever since, progress around SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been swift."
9432,"Within weeks of the first isolate being obtained, its complete genome was sequenced."
9433,Diagnostic tests based on the detection of SARS-CoV RNA were developed and made available freely and widely; nevertheless the SARS case definition still remains based on clinical and epidemiological criteria.
9434,"The agent’s environmental stability, methods suitable for inactivation and disinfection, and potential antiviral compounds have been studied, and development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics is ongoing."
9435,"Despite its grave consequences in humanitarian, political and economic terms, SARS may serve as an example of how much can be achieved through a well-coordinated international approach, combining the latest technological advances of molecular virology with more “traditional” techniques carried out to an excellent standard."
9436,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pulmonary infection with ∼35% mortality.
9437,The potential for a future pandemic originating from animal reservoirs or health care-associated events is a major public health concern.
9438,There are no vaccines or therapeutic agents currently available for MERS-CoV.
9439,"Using a probe-based single B cell cloning strategy, we have identified and characterized multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specifically binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S1 (non-RBD) regions from a convalescent MERS-CoV-infected patient and from immunized rhesus macaques."
9440,RBD-specific MAbs tended to have greater neutralizing potency than non-RBD S1-specific MAbs.
9441,"Six RBD-specific and five S1-specific MAbs could be sorted into four RBD and three non-RBD distinct binding patterns, based on competition assays, mapping neutralization escape variants, and structural analysis."
9442,We determined cocrystal structures for two MAbs targeting the RBD from different angles and show they can bind the RBD only in the “out” position.
9443,"We then showed that selected RBD-specific, non-RBD S1-specific, and S2-specific MAbs given prophylactically prevented MERS-CoV replication in lungs and protected mice from lethal challenge."
9444,"Importantly, combining RBD- and non-RBD MAbs delayed the emergence of escape mutations in a cell-based virus escape assay."
9445,These studies identify MAbs targeting different antigenic sites on S that will be useful for defining mechanisms of MERS-CoV neutralization and for developing more effective interventions to prevent or treat MERS-CoV infections.
9446,IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes a highly lethal respiratory infection for which no vaccines or antiviral therapeutic options are currently available.
9447,"Based on continuing exposure from established reservoirs in dromedary camels and bats, transmission of MERS-CoV into humans and future outbreaks are expected."
9448,"Using structurally defined probes for the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S), the target for neutralizing antibodies, single B cells were sorted from a convalescent human and immunized nonhuman primates (NHPs)."
9449,MAbs produced from paired immunoglobulin gene sequences were mapped to multiple epitopes within and outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and protected against lethal MERS infection in a murine model following passive immunization.
9450,"Importantly, combining MAbs targeting distinct epitopes prevented viral neutralization escape from RBD-directed MAbs."
9451,These data suggest that antibody responses to multiple domains on CoV spike protein may improve immunity and will guide future vaccine and therapeutic development efforts.
9452,The aim of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation.
9453,We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation.
9454,We include a discussion of needed breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the lab.
9455,"In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms."
9456,The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies.
9457,"In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling."
9458,"A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today’s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread."
9459,"Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues."
9460,The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East since 2012 has caused more than 900 human infections with ∼40% mortality to date.
9461,Animal models are needed for studying pathogenesis and for development of preventive and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection.
9462,Nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques and marmosets) are expensive models of limited availability.
9463,"Although a mouse lung infection model has been described using adenovirus vectors expressing human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), it is believed that a transgenic mouse model is needed for MERS-CoV research."
9464,We have developed this transgenic mouse model as indicated in this study.
9465,"We show that transgenic mice globally expressing hCD26/DPP4 were fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection, resulting in relentless weight loss and death within days postinfection."
9466,"High infectious virus titers were recovered primarily from the lungs and brains of mice at 2 and 4 days postinfection, respectively, whereas viral RNAs were also detected in the heart, spleen, and intestine, indicating a disseminating viral infection."
9467,"Infected Tg(+) mice developed a progressive pneumonia, characterized by extensive inflammatory infiltration."
9468,"In contrast, an inconsistent mild perivascular cuffing was the only pathological change associated with the infected brains."
9469,"Moreover, infected Tg(+) mice were able to activate genes encoding for many antiviral and inflammatory mediators within the lungs and brains, coinciding with the high levels of viral replication."
9470,This new and unique transgenic mouse model will be useful for furthering knowledge of MERS pathogenesis and for the development of vaccine and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
9471,IMPORTANCE Small and economical animal models are required for the controlled and extensive studies needed for elucidating pathogenesis and development of vaccines and antivirals against MERS.
9472,"Mice are the most desirable small-animal species for this purpose because of availability and the existence of a thorough knowledge base, particularly of genetics and immunology."
9473,"The standard small animals, mice, hamsters, and ferrets, all lack the functional MERS-CoV receptor and are not susceptible to infection."
9474,"So, initial studies were done with nonhuman primates, expensive models of limited availability."
9475,A mouse lung infection model was described where a mouse adenovirus was used to transfect lung cells for receptor expression.
9476,"Nevertheless, all generally agree that a transgenic mouse model expressing the DPP4 receptor is needed for MERS-CoV research."
9477,We have developed this transgenic mouse model as indicated in this study.
9478,This new and unique transgenic mouse model will be useful for furthering MERS research.
9479,  This chapter focuses on non-HIV antiviral agents.
9480,The development of antiviral agents to treat non-HIV infections is largely focused on therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis infections B and C. Nucleoside analog continue to be the mainstay of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutics.
9481,"The first small molecule inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the NS3 protease inhibitor BILN-2061, entered phase 2 clinical trials, producing a striking reduction in viral load in treated individuals."
9482,The development of the HCV replicon system and its application to screening for antiviral agents provided tangible benefit with the disclosure of mechanistically and structurally diverse HCV inhibitors.
9483,"Adefovir dipivoxil has been approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of HBV, providing a second small molecule antiviral to add to lamivudine (3TC) and the injectable protein IFNα as the only approved agents for treating HBV infection."
9484,"The chapter also provides details of the inhibitors of hepatitis B and C virus, the inhibitors of simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus, the inhibitors of respiratory viruses and the inhibitors of West Nile virus and Papilloma virus."
9485,Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus that infects the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
9486,"The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals, including cattle, rodents, and dogs."
9487,"In these nonnatural hosts, PRV always causes a severe acute and lethal neuropathy called the “mad itch,” which is uncommon in swine."
9488,"Thus far, the pathophysiological and immunological processes leading to the development of the neuropathic itch and the death of the animal are unclear."
9489,"Using a footpad inoculation model, we established that mice inoculated with PRV-Becker (virulent strain) develop a severe pruritus in the foot and become moribund at 82 h postinoculation (hpi)."
9490,We found necrosis and inflammation with a massive neutrophil infiltration only in the footpad and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) by hematoxylin and eosin staining.
9491,"PRV load was detected in the foot, PNS, and central nervous system tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR."
9492,Infected mice had elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) and chemokines (Gro-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1).
9493,Significant IL-6 and G-CSF levels were detected in several tissues at 82 hpi.
9494,High plasma levels of C-reactive protein confirmed the acute inflammatory response to PRV-Becker infection.
9495,"Moreover, mice inoculated with PRV-Bartha (attenuated, live vaccine strain) did not develop pruritus at 82 hpi."
9496,"PRV-Bartha also replicated in the PNS, and the infection spread further in the brain than PRV-Becker."
9497,PRV-Bartha infection did not induce the specific and lethal systemic inflammatory response seen with PRV-Becker.
9498,"Overall, we demonstrated the importance of inflammation in the clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice and provide new insights into the process of PRV-induced neuroinflammation."
9499,IMPORTANCE Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to human pathogens such as herpes simplex virus 1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).
9500,"The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals."
9501,"In susceptible animals other than pigs, PRV infection always causes a characteristic lethal pruritus known as the “mad itch.” The role of the immune response in the clinical outcome of PRV infection is still poorly understood."
9502,"Here, we show that a systemic host inflammatory response is responsible for the severe pruritus and acute death of mice infected with virulent PRV-Becker but not mice infected with attenuated strain PRV-Bartha."
9503,"In addition, we identified IL-6 and G-CSF as two main cytokines that play crucial roles in the regulation of this process."
9504,Our findings give new insights into neuroinflammatory diseases and strengthen further the similarities between VZV and PRV infections at the level of innate immunity.
9505," Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012, and it continues to threaten human health worldwide."
9506,"No MERS vaccines are licensed for human use, reinforcing the urgency to develop safe and efficacious vaccines to prevent MERS."
9507,"MERS-CoV spike protein forms a trimer, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) serves as a vaccine target."
9508,"Nevertheless, the protective efficacy of RBD in its native trimeric form has never been evaluated."
9509,"In this study, a trimeric protein, RBD-Fd, was generated by fusing RBD with foldon trimerization motif."
9510,"It bound strongly to the receptor of MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and elicited robust RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, maintaining long-term neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection."
9511,RBD-Fd potently protected hDPP4 transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge.
9512,"These results suggest that MERS-CoV RBD in its trimeric form maintains native conformation and induces protective neutralizing antibodies, making it a candidate for further therapeutic development."
9513,"Recently, two coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have emerged to cause unusually severe respiratory disease in humans."
9514,"Currently, there is a lack of effective antiviral treatment options or vaccine available."
9515,"Given the severity of these outbreaks, and the possibility of additional zoonotic coronaviruses emerging in the near future, the exploration of different treatment strategies is necessary."
9516,"Disease resilience is the ability of a given host to tolerate an infection, and to return to a state of health."
9517,"This review focuses on exploring various host resilience mechanisms that could be exploited for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses that cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome."
9518, Surveillance for zoonotic diseases among wildlife is a research and public health challenge.
9519,The inherent limitations posed by the requisite human–animal interactions are often undefined and underappreciated.
9520,"The national surveillance system for animal rabies in the United States was examined as a model system; reporting of animal rabies is legally mandated, each case of rabies is laboratory confirmed, and data have been consistently collected for more than 50 years."
9521,Factors influencing the monthly counts of animal rabies tests reported during 1992–2001 were assessed by univariate and multivariable regression methods.
9522,The suitability of passively collected surveillance data for determining the presence or absence of the raccoon-associated variant of rabies within states and within individual counties was assessed by determining critical threshold values from the regression analyses.
9523,"The size of the human population and total expenditures within a county accounted for 72% and 67%, respectively, of the variance in testing."
9524,"The annual median number of rabies tests performed was seven for counties without rabies, 22 for counties with non-raccoon rabies, and 34 for counties with raccoon rabies."
9525,Active surveillance may be required in locales with sparse human populations when a high degree of confidence in the status of rabies is required.
9526, We have always wanted to save the world from the scourges of virus infection by developing better drugs and vaccines.
9527,"But fully understanding the intricacies of virus–host interactions, the first step in achieving this goal, requires the ability to view the process on a grand scale."
9528,"The advent of high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry, provided the first opportunities to obtain such a view."
9529,"Here, we describe our efforts to use these tools to focus on the changes in cellular gene expression and protein abundance that occur in response to virus infection."
9530,"By examining these changes in a comprehensive manner, we have been able to discover exciting new insights into innate immunity, interferon and cytokine signaling, and the strategies used by viruses to overcome these cellular defenses."
9531,Functional genomics may yet save the world from killer viruses.
9532, The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus caused severe disease and heavy economic losses before apparently coming under complete control.
9533,"Our understanding of the forces driving seasonal disappearance and recurrence of infectious diseases remains fragmentary, thus limiting any predictions about whether, or when, SARS will recur."
9534,"It is true that most established respiratory pathogens of human beings recur in wintertime, but a new appreciation for the high burden of disease in tropical areas reinforces questions about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity."
9535,Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute.
9536,Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza have recurred in unpredictable patterns.
9537,"Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with a unique ability to establish persistent infections in a minority of infected animals."
9538,"Because SARS coronavirus RNA can be detected in the stool of some individuals for at least 9 weeks, recurrence of SARS from persistently shedding human or animal reservoirs is biologically plausible."
9539," In 2012 in Jordan, infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused the first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
9540,MERS-CoV sequences have since been found in a bat and the virus appears to be enzootic among dromedary camels across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa.
9541,The majority of human cases have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
9542,"In humans, the etiologic agent, MERS-CoV, has been detected in severe, mild and influenza-like illness and in those without any obvious signs or symptoms of disease."
9543,"MERS is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death among more than a third of those infected."
9544,Severe disease is usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of MERS.
9545,"Compared to SARS, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, is more often observed as severe disease in patients with underlying illnesses and is more often fatal."
9546,"MERS-CoV has a broader tropism than SARS-CoV, rapidly triggers cellular damage, employs a different receptor and induces a delayed proinflammatory response in cells."
9547,"Most human cases have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, with a fifth of virus detections reported among healthcare workers."
9548,"This review sets out what is currently known about MERS and the MERS-CoV, summarises the new phenomenon of crowd-sourced epidemiology and lists some of the many questions that remain unanswered, nearly three years after the first reported case."
9549,Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by infection with BVD virus (BVDV) and can result in economic losses within the livestock industry.
9550,"In Japan, the test and culling policy is a basic control measure, and implementation of an adequate vaccination program is recommended as a national policy."
9551,"In addition, optional control measures, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) testing as a mass screening method, are used in several provinces, but their efficacy has not been completely assessed."
9552,"We evaluated these control measures using the scenario tree model of BVD in Japan, developed in the previous study."
9553,"The model outputs indicated that compulsory testing of all introduced cattle, rather than only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, was cost effective and reduced the risk of BVDV introduction due to animal movement and that BTM testing could effectively monitor most part of the cattle population."
9554,"Vaccination coverage and BVDV prevalence among introduced cattle could also affect the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of targeted cattle, particularly under low vaccination coverage or high BVDV prevalence."
9555,"However, even with the implementation of a highly effective monitoring scheme for many years, BVD risk could not be eliminated; it instead converged at a very low level (0.02%)."
9556,"Disease models with a cost-effective output could be a powerful tool in developing a control scheme for chronic animal diseases, including BVD, with the consent of relevant stakeholders."
9557,Preexisting antibodies may enhance viral infections.
9558,"In dengue, nonneutralizing antibodies raised by natural infection with one of four dengue viruses (DENVs) may enhance infection with a different virus by a process we term “intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement” (iADE)."
9559,"In addition, nonprotective antibodies raised by formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles virus vaccines have led to enhanced disease during breakthrough infections."
9560,"Infections under iADE conditions not only facilitate the process of viral entry into monocytes and macrophages but also modify innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral mechanisms, suppressing type 1 interferon (IFN) production and resulting in enhanced DENV replication."
9561,The suppression observed in vitro has been documented in patients with severe (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]) but not in patient with mild (dengue fever [DF]) secondary dengue virus infections.
9562,Important veterinary viral infections also may exhibit iADE.
9563,"It is thought that use of formalin deconforms viral epitopes of RSV, resulting in poor Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation; suboptimal maturation of dendritic cells with reduced production of activation factors CD40, CD80, and CD86; decreased germinal center formation in lymph nodes; and the production of nonprotective antibodies."
9564,"These antibodies fail to neutralize RSV, allowing replication with secondary stimulation of RSV-primed Th2 cells producing more low-avidity antibody, resulting in immune complexes deposited into affected tissue."
9565,"However, when formalin-inactivated RSV was administered with a TLR agonist to mice, they were protected against wild-type virus challenge."
9566,Safe and effective vaccines against RSV/measles virus and dengue virus may benefit from a better understanding of how innate immune responses can promote production of protective antibodies.
9567,Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa Fever and is responsible for several hundred thousand infections and thousands of deaths annually in West Africa.
9568,LASV and the non-pathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) are both rodent-borne African arenaviruses.
9569,"A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge and appears to be more attenuated than MOPV."
9570,To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML29.
9571,PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29.
9572,"Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles."
9573,Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays.
9574,"Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA."
9575,"LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways."
9576,These genes could eventually serve as biomarkers to predict disease outcomes.
9577,"The remarkable differential expression of thrombomodulin, a key regulator of inflammation and coagulation, suggests its involvement with vascular abnormalities and mortality in Lassa fever disease."
9578,Recent years have seen extremely fast development of new viral nanovaccines and diagnostic agents using nanostructures prepared by biological and chemical synthesis.
9579,"We used spherical gold nanoparticles (average diameter, 15 nm) as a platform for the antigen for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)."
9580,The literature data demonstrate that immunization of animals with the TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles (GNPs) not only activates antigen-presenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells.
9581,"The contents of γ-IFN, IL-1β, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were found to be higher than those in intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone."
9582,"The increased concentration of IL-1β in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated."
9583,The increased concentration of IL-6 indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity.
9584,"Immunization with the TGEV antigen conjugated to GNPs as a carrier activates the respiratory activity of lymphoid cells and peritoneal macrophages, which is directly related to their transforming activity and to the activation of antibody generation."
9585,"Furthermore, the use of this conjugate allows marked improvement of the structure of the animals’ immune organs and restores the morphological–functional state of these organs."
9586,"The microanatomical changes (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and, consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction."
9587,The degradative processes observed in the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack.
9588,These results can be used to develop vaccines against this infection by employing TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles as a carrier.
9589, Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is generally benign in humans.
9590,"However, an emergent strain of ZIKV has become widespread, causing severe pre- and post-natal neurological defects."
9591,There is now an urgent need for prophylactic and therapeutic agents.
9592,"To address this, we investigated six human monoclonal antibodies with ZIKV epitope specificity and neutralizing activity in mouse models of ZIKV infection and microcephaly."
9593,"A single intraperitoneal injection of these antibodies conveyed distinct levels of adult and in utero protection from ZIKV infection, which closely mirrored their respective in vitro neutralizing activities."
9594,"One antibody, ZK2B10, showed the most potent neutralization activity, completely protected uninfected mice, and markedly reduced tissue pathology in infected mice."
9595,"Thus, ZK2B10 is a promising candidate for the development of antibody-based interventions and informs the rational design of ZIKV vaccine."
9596,The outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and the subsequent identification of its animal origin study have heightened the world's awareness of animal-borne or zoonotic pathogens.
9597,"In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds."
9598,"Even the ‘well-known’ reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus."
9599,"Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively)."
9600,"Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease."
9601,Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control.
9602,"A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety."
9603,"All of these pathogens occur in Southeast Asia, including China, with severe consequences; therefore, we discuss the issues in this article by addressing the situation of the zoonotic threat in China."
9604,"Many of the viral pathogens that cause infectious diseases in humans have a highly restricted species tropism, making the study of their pathogenesis and the development of clinical therapies difficult."
9605,The improvement of humanized mouse models over the past 30 years has greatly facilitated researchers’ abilities to study host responses to viral infections in a cost effective and ethical manner.
9606,"From HIV to hepatotropic viruses to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, humanized mice have led to the identification of factors crucial to the viral life cycle, served as an outlet for testing candidate therapies, and improved our abilities to analyze human immune responses to infection."
9607,"In tackling both new and old viruses as they emerge, humanized mice will continue to be an indispensable tool."
9608, Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection.
9609,The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies.
9610,"Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results."
9611,"In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus."
9612,"After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined."
9613,"Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa."
9614,All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150–250ng per 109 CFU).
9615,"However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG)."
9616,Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge.
9617,Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
9618,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance, has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1600 people, resulting in almost 600 deaths."
9619,"The high case fatality rate, growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined epidemiology of this novel pathogen have created an urgent need for effective public health countermeasures, including safe and effective treatment strategies."
9620,"Despite the relatively few numbers of cases to date, research and development of MERS-CoV therapeutic candidates is advancing quickly."
9621,This review surveys the landscape of these efforts and assesses their potential for use in affected populations.
9622,"The Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has emerged as a global public health concern."
9623,"Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against other flaviviruses could modulate immune responses to ZIKV infection by antibody-dependent enhancement, highlighting the importance of understanding the immunogenicity of the ZIKV envelope protein."
9624,"In this study, we identified a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope protein from a very large phage-display naive antibody library."
9625,"These germline-like antibodies, sharing 98%–100% hoLogy with their corresponding germline IGHV genes, bound ZIKV DIII specifically with high affinities."
9626,"One mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the currently circulating ZIKV strains and showed a synergistic effect with another mAb, m302, in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection."
9627,"Interestingly, epitope mapping and competitive binding studies suggest that m301 and m302 bind adjacent regions of the DIII C–C′ loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope that is intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation."
9628,This study extended our understanding of antigenic epitopes of ZIKV antibodies and has direct implications for the design of ZIKV vaccines.
9629, Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most important cause of clinical disease and death in feedlot cattle.
9630,Respiratory viral infections are key components in predisposing cattle to the development of this disease.
9631,"To quantify the contribution of four viruses commonly associated with BRD, a case-control study was conducted nested within the National Bovine Respiratory Disease Initiative project population in Australian feedlot cattle."
9632,"Effects of exposure to Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), and to combinations of these viruses, were investigated."
9633,"Based on weighted seroprevalences at induction (when animals were enrolled and initial samples collected), the percentages of the project population estimated to be seropositive were 24% for BoHV-1, 69% for BVDV-1, 89% for BRSV and 91% for BPIV-3."
9634,"For each of the four viruses, seropositivity at induction was associated with reduced risk of BRD (OR: 0.6–0.9), and seroincrease from induction to second blood sampling (35–60 days after induction) was associated with increased risk of BRD (OR: 1.3–1.5)."
9635,"Compared to animals that were seropositive for all four viruses at induction, animals were at progressively increased risk with increasing number of viruses for which they were seronegative; those seronegative for all four viruses were at greatest risk (OR: 2.4)."
9636,Animals that seroincreased for one or more viruses from induction to second blood sampling were at increased risk (OR: 1.4–2.1) of BRD compared to animals that did not seroincrease for any viruses.
9637,Collectively these results confirm that prior exposure to these viruses is protective while exposure at or after feedlot entry increases the risk of development of BRD in feedlots.
9638,"However, the modest increases in risk associated with seroincrease for each virus separately, and the progressive increases in risk with multiple viral exposures highlights the importance of concurrent infections in the aetiology of the BRD complex."
9639,"These findings indicate that, while efficacious vaccines could aid in the control of BRD, vaccination against one of these viruses would not have large effects on population BRD incidence but vaccination against multiple viruses would be expected to result in greater reductions in incidence."
9640,"The findings also confirm the multifactorial nature of BRD development, and indicate that multifaceted approaches in addition to efficacious vaccines against viruses will be required for substantial reductions in BRD incidence."
9641, Human rhinoviruses (HRV) represent the single most important etiological agents of the common cold and are the most frequent cause of acute respiratory infections in humans.
9642,Currently the performance of available animal models for immunization studies using HRV challenge is very limited.
9643,The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a well-recognized model for the study of human respiratory viral infections.
9644,"In this work we show that, without requiring any genetic modification of either the host or the virus, intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV16 resulted in measurable isolation of infective virus, lower respiratory tract pathology, mucus production, and expression of interferon-activated genes."
9645,Intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 generated robust protective immunity that correlated with high serum levels of neutralizing antibodies.
9646,"In addition, cotton rats treated prophylactically with hyperimmune anti-HRV16 serum were protected against HRV16 intranasal challenge."
9647,"Finally, protection by immunization was efficiently transferred from mothers to newborn animals resulting in a substantial reduction of infectious virus loads in the lung following intranasal challenge."
9648,"Overall, our results demonstrate that the cotton rat provides valuable additional model development options for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against rhinovirus infection."
9649,This overview is an update of the unit originally published in 2004.
9650,"While the basic tenants of immunotoxicity have not changed in the past 10 years, several publications have explored the application of immunotoxicological data to the risk assessment process."
9651,"Therefore, the goal of this unit is still to highlight relationships between xenobiotic-induced immunosuppression and risk of clinical diseases progression."
9652,"In immunotoxicology, this may require development of models to equate moderate changes in markers of immune functions to potential changes in incidence or severity of infectious diseases."
9653,"For most xenobiotics, exposure levels and disease incidence data are rarely available and safe exposure levels must be estimated based on observations from experimental models or human biomarker studies."
9654,"Thus, it is important to establish a scientifically sound framework that allows accurate and quantitative interpretation of experimental or biomarker data in the risk assessment process."
9655,"Human respiratory syncytial virus is an important cause of severe respiratory disease in young children, the elderly, and in immunocompromised adults."
9656,"Similarly, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves."
9657,"Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics."
9658,In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal.
9659,Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract.
9660,Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells.
9661,"Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells."
9662,"The number of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection."
9663,"Human respiratory syncytial virus is an important cause of severe respiratory disease in young children, the elderly, and in immunocompromised adults."
9664,"Similarly, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves."
9665,"Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics."
9666,In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal.
9667,Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract.
9668,Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells.
9669,"Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells."
9670,"The number of both CD4(+) and CD8+ T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection."
9671,"Emerging infections have an enormous impact on human health, food supply, economics, and the environment."
9672,"Animals, and wild animals in particular, are considered to be the source of more than 70% of all emerging infections in humans."
9673,"Two zoonotic influenza viruses that successfully spread from animals to humans are highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, originating from poultry, and pandemic H1N1 influenza (pH1N1) virus, thought to originate from domestic swine."
9674,"In this review, we discuss our research on the host species barrier for these viruses, concentrating on three questions: how does HPAI H5N1 virus transmit from birds to humans; what are the within-host dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus and pH1N1 virus in humans and other mammals; and what determines transmission of influenza viruses among humans."
9675,"To contain and eradicate zoonotic influenza viruses requires not only strategic virus surveillance of both animal and human populations, but also a better understanding of the hurdles that such a virus needs to jump over in order to cross the species barrier and cause a human pandemic."
9676,Advances in these two areas will allow us to better predict the risk of emergence of zoonotic influenza viruses in the human population.
9677,Background.
9678,"Epidemiological studies suggest that, following infection with influenza virus, there is a short period during which a host experiences a lower susceptibility to infection with other influenza viruses."
9679,This viral interference appears to be independent of any antigenic similarities between the viruses.
9680,We used the ferret model of human influenza to systematically investigate viral interference.
9681,Methods.
9682,"Ferrets were first infected then challenged 1–14 days later with pairs of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses circulating in 2009 and 2010."
9683,Results.
9684,Viral interference was observed when the interval between initiation of primary infection and subsequent challenge was <1 week.
9685,This effect was virus specific and occurred between antigenically related and unrelated viruses.
9686,Coinfections occurred when 1 or 3 days separated infections.
9687,Ongoing shedding from the primary virus infection was associated with viral interference after the secondary challenge.
9688,Conclusions.
9689,The interval between infections and the sequential combination of viruses were important determinants of viral interference.
9690,"The influenza viruses in this study appear to have an ordered hierarchy according to their ability to block or delay infection, which may contribute to the dominance of different viruses often seen in an influenza season."
9691,H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 HPAI) virus causes elevated mortality compared with seasonal influenza viruses like H1N1 pandemic influenza (H1N1 pdm) virus.
9692,We identified a mechanism associated with the severe symptoms seen with H5N1 HPAI virus infection.
9693,"H5N1 HPAI virus infection induced a decrease of dendritic cell number in the splenic extrafollicular T-cell zone and impaired formation of the outer layers of B-cell follicles, resulting in insufficient levels of antibody production after infection."
9694,"However, in animals vaccinated with a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the H5 hemagglutinin, infection with H5N1 HPAI virus induced parafollicular dendritic cell accumulation and efficient antibody production."
9695,These results indicate that a recombinant vaccinia encoding H5 hemagglutinin gene does not impair dendritic cell recruitment and can be a useful vaccine candidate.
9696,Viral attachment to the host cell is critical for tissue and species specificity of virus infections.
9697,"Recently, pattern of viral attachment (PVA) in human respiratory tract was determined for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtype H5N1."
9698,"However, PVA of human influenza viruses and other avian influenza viruses in either humans or experimental animals is unknown."
9699,"Therefore, we compared PVA of two human influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and two low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (H5N9 and H6N1) with that of H5N1 virus in respiratory tract tissues of humans, mice, ferrets, cynomolgus macaques, cats, and pigs by virus histochemistry."
9700,We found that human influenza viruses attached more strongly to human trachea and bronchi than H5N1 virus and attached to different cell types than H5N1 virus.
9701,These differences correspond to primary diagnoses of tracheobronchitis for human influenza viruses and diffuse alveolar damage for H5N1 virus.
9702,"The PVA of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in human respiratory tract resembled that of H5N1 virus, demonstrating that other properties determine its pathogenicity for humans."
9703,"The PVA in human respiratory tract most closely mirrored that in ferrets and pigs for human influenza viruses and that in ferrets, pigs, and cats for avian influenza viruses."
9704, Influenza A H7N9 virus has demonstrated considerable pandemic potential in China ever since early spring 2013.
9705,"Until now, there have been no specific medicines to treat influenza A H7N9 virus infected patients."
9706,Development of a safe and effective H7N9 therapeutic preparation is urgently needed.
9707,"To this end, we prepared and evaluated the pepsin-digested F(ab′)2 fragments of serum IgGs from the horses inoculated with a inactivated influenza A H7N9 whole virus antigens."
9708,"The protective effects of the F(ab′)2 fragments against H7N9 virus infection were determined in cultured MDCK cells by cytopathic effect (CPE) and evaluated in a BALB/c mouse model by observing death, weight loss and viral load."
9709,"The in vitro results showed that the F(ab′)2 fragments had an HI titer of 1:2048 and a neutralization titer of 1: 31,623."
9710,The in vivo assays suggested that 600U of the preparations could efficiently protect BALB/c mice from a lethal dose of A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) infection even when administered two days post infection.
9711,"Thus, this highly purified preparation should be a potential candidate for treating severe patients suffering from influenza A H7N9."
9712,Various fluorodeoxyribonucleosides were evaluated for their antiviral activities against influenza virus infections in vitro and in vivo.
9713,Among the most potent inhibitors was 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine (2'-FdC).
9714,"It inhibited various strains of low and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses, pandemic H1N1 viruses, an oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 virus, and seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2, H1N1, influenza B) in MDCK cells, with the 90% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.13 µM to 4.6 µM, as determined by a virus yield reduction assay."
9715,2'-FdC was then tested for efficacy in BALB/c mice infected with a lethal dose of highly pathogenic influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus.
9716,2’FdC (60 mg/kg/d) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.)
9717,twice a day beginning 24 h after virus exposure significantly promoted survival (80% survival) of infected mice (p=0.0001).
9718,Equally efficacious were the treatment regimens in which mice were treated with 2'-FdC at 30 or 60 mg/kg/day (bid × 8) beginning 24 h before virus exposure.
9719,"At these doses, 70–80% of the mice were protected from death due to virus infection (p=0.0005, p=0.0001; respectively)."
9720,"The lungs harvested from treated mice at day four of the infection displayed little surface pathology or histopathology, lung weights were lower, and the 60 mg/kg dose reduced lung virus titers, although not significantly compared to the placebo controls."
9721,All doses were well tolerated in uninfected mice.
9722,2'-FdC could also be administered as late as 72 h post virus exposure and still significantly protect 60% mice from the lethal effects of the H5N1 virus infection (p=0.019).
9723,"Other fluorodeoxyribonucleosides tested in the H5N1 mouse model, 2’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine and 2'-deoxy-2', 2'-difluorocytidine, were very toxic at higher doses and not inhibitory at lower doses."
9724,"Finally, 2'-FdC, which was active in the H5N1 mouse model, was also active in a pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection model in mice."
9725,"When given at 30 mg/kg/d (bid × 5) beginning 24 h before virus exposure), 2’-FdC also significantly enhanced survival of H1N1-infected mice (50%, p=0.038) similar to the results obtained in the H5N1 infection model using a similar dosing regimen (50%, p<0.05)."
9726,"Given the demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of avian influenza virus replication, 2’FdC may qualify as a lead compound for the development of agents treating influenza virus infections."
9727,"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and other neurotropic virus infections result in degeneration of each component of the neuron: apoptosis of the cell body, axonal (Wallerian) degeneration, and dendritic and synaptic pathology."
9728,"In general, axonal degeneration is detrimental for hosts."
9729,"However, axonal degeneration can be beneficial in the case of infection with neurotropic viruses that spread in the CNS using axonal transport."
9730,"C57BL/Wld(S) (Wld(S), Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) mice are protected from axonal degeneration."
9731,"Wld(S) mice infected with the neurovirulent GDVII strain of TMEV are more resistant to virus infection than wild-type mice, suggesting that axonal preservation contributes to the resistance."
9732,"By contrast, infection with the less virulent Daniels strain of TMEV results in high levels of virus propagation in the CNS, suggesting that prolonged survival of axons in Wld(S) mice favors virus spread."
9733,"Thus, axonal degeneration might be a beneficial self-destruct mechanism that limits the spread of neurotropic viruses, in the case of less virulent virus infection."
9734,"We hypothesize that neurons use ‘built-in’ self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site."
9735,Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication.
9736,Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus.
9737,Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses.
9738,"Thus, the balance between neurodegeneration and virus propagation may be taken into account in the future design of neuroprotective therapy."
9739,"An adenovirus 5 vector encoding for mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 (mDEF201) was evaluated for efficacy against lethal cowpox (Brighton strain) and vaccinia (WR strain) virus respiratory and systemic infections in mice."
9740,"Two routes of mDEF201 administration were used, nasal sinus (5-µl) and pulmonary (50-µl), to compare differences in efficacy, since the preferred treatment of humans would be in a relatively small volume delivered intranasally."
9741,"Lower respiratory infections (LRI), upper respiratory infections (URI), and systemic infections were induced by 50-µl intranasal, 10-µl intranasal, and 100-µl intraperitoneal virus challenges, respectively."
9742,mDEF201 treatments were given prophylactically either 24 h (short term) or 56d (long-term) prior to virus challenge.
9743,Single nasal sinus treatments of 10(6) and 10(7) PFU/mouse of mDEF201 protected all mice from vaccinia-induced LRI mortality (comparable to published studies with pulmonary delivered mDEF201).
9744,Systemic vaccinia infections responded significantly better to nasal sinus delivered mDEF201 than to pulmonary treatments.
9745,"Cowpox LRI infections responded to 10(7) mDEF201 treatments, but a 10(6) dose was only weakly protective."
9746,Cowpox URI infections were equally treatable by nasal sinus and pulmonary delivered mDEF201 at 10(7) PFU/mouse.
9747,"Dose-responsive prophylaxis with mDEF201, given one time only 56 d prior to initiating a vaccinia virus LRI infection, was 100% protective from 10(5) to 10(7) PFU/mouse."
9748,"Improvements in lung hemorrhage score and lung weight were evident, as were decreases in liver, lung, and spleen virus titers."
9749,"Thus, mDEF201 was able to treat different vaccinia and cowpox virus infections using both nasal sinus and pulmonary treatment regimens, supporting its development for humans."
9750,Epidemic and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human populations worldwide.
9751,Iridoid glycosides are principal bioactive components from the Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis fruit that exhibit antiviral activity against several strains of IAV.
9752,"In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of Fructus Gardeniae iridoid glycoside extracts (IGEs) against IAV by cytopathogenic effect(CPE), MTT and a plaque formation assay in vitro and examined the reduction in the pulmonary index (PI), restoration of body weight, reduction in mortality and increases in survival time in vivo."
9753,"As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response."
9754,"To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFNβ, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells."
9755,"The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection."
9756,These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response.
9757,"Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner."
9758,Dengue virus is a major human pathogen responsible for 400 million infections yearly.
9759,"As with other RNA viruses, daunting challenges to antiviral design exist due to the high error rates of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis."
9760,"Indeed, treatment of dengue virus infection with a nucleoside analog resulted in the expected genetic selection of resistant viruses in tissue culture and in mice."
9761,"However, when the function of the oligomeric core protein was inhibited, no detectable selection of drug resistance in tissue culture or in mice was detected, despite the presence of drug-resistant variants in the population."
9762,Suppressed selection of drug-resistant virus correlated with cooligomerization of the targeted drug-susceptible and drug-resistant core proteins.
9763,"The concept of “dominant drug targets,” in which inhibition of oligomeric viral assemblages leads to the formation of drug-susceptible chimeras, can therefore be used to prevent the outgrowth of drug resistance during dengue virus infection."
9764,"The study of virus disease emergence, whether it can be predicted and how it might be prevented, has become a major research topic in biomedicine."
9765,"Here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans."
9766,"Although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family-scale phylogenetic trees, these data have little predictive power to reveal the short-term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross-species transmission and emergence."
9767,Truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts.
9768,"We present such a view, suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework, which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful."
9769,"Despite this framework, we conclude that a more practical solution to preventing and containing the successful emergence of new diseases entails ongoing virological surveillance at the human–animal interface and regions of ecological disturbance."
9770,Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an essential pathway in cell cycle control.
9771,Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway during viral infection has been reported.
9772,"In this study, we examined the effect of modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling during influenza virus infection."
9773,The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by Wnt3a increased influenza virus mRNA and virus production in in vitro in mouse lung epithelial E10 cells and mRNA expresson of influenza virus genes in vivo in the lungs of mice infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34.
9774,"However, the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by iCRT14 reduced virus titer and viral gene expression in human lung epithelial A549 cells and viral replication in primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells infected with different influenza virus strains."
9775,Knockdown of β-catenin also reduced viral protein expression and virus production.
9776,iCRT14 acts at the early stage of virus replication.
9777,"Treatment with iCRT14 inhibited the expression of the viral genes (vRNA, cRNA and mRNA) evaluated in this study."
9778,"The intraperitoneal administration of iCRT14 reduced viral load, improved clinical signs, and partially protected mice from influenza virus infection."
9779,H5N1 avian influenza is a highly fatal infectious disease that could cause a potentially devastating pandemic if the H5N1 virus mutates into a form that spreads efficiently among humans.
9780,Recent findings have led to a basic understanding of cell and organ histopathology caused by the H5N1 virus.
9781,Here we review the pathology of H5N1 avian influenza reported in postmortem and clinical studies and discuss the key pathogenetic mechanisms.
9782,"Specifically, the virus infects isolated pulmonary epithelial cells and causes diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhage in the lungs of infected patients."
9783,"In addition, the virus may infect other organs, including the trachea, the intestines, and the brain, and it may penetrate the placental barrier and infect the fetus."
9784,Dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines is likely to be one of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza.
9785,We also review the various molecular determinants of increased pathogenicity that have been identified in recent years and the role of avian and human influenza virus receptors in relation to the transmissibility of the H5N1 virus.
9786,"A comprehensive appreciation of H5N1 influenza pathogenetic mechanisms should aid in the design of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this emerging disease."
9787,We detected influenza D virus in 18 nasal swab samples from cattle in Ireland that were clinically diagnosed with respiratory disease.
9788,Specimens were obtained from archived samples received for routine diagnosis during 2014–2016.
9789,Sequencing showed that viruses from Ireland clustered with virus sequences obtained in Europe within the D/swine/OK/1334/2011 clade.
9790,Influenza A viruses are amongst the most challenging viruses that threaten both human and animal health.
9791,Influenza A viruses are unique in many ways.
9792,"Firstly, they are unique in the diversity of host species that they infect."
9793,"This includes waterfowl (the original reservoir), terrestrial and aquatic poultry, swine, humans, horses, dog, cats, whales, seals and several other mammalian species."
9794,"Secondly, they are unique in their capacity to evolve and adapt, following crossing the species barrier, in order to replicate and spread to other individuals within the new species."
9795,"Finally, they are unique in the frequency of inter-species transmission events that occur."
9796,"Indeed, the consequences of novel influenza virus strain in an immunologically naïve population can be devastating."
9797,The problems that influenza A viruses present for human and animal health are numerous.
9798,"For example, influenza A viruses in humans represent a major economic and disease burden, whilst the poultry industry has suffered colossal damage due to repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses."
9799,This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of influenza A viruses by shedding light on interspecies virus transmission and summarising the current knowledge regarding how influenza viruses can adapt to a new host.
9800,CHAPTER 1 Overview of Viruses and Virus Infection
9801,"Humans may be infected by different influenza A viruses—seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic—which differ in presentation from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe and sometimes fatal pneumonia with extra-respiratory spread."
9802,Differences in spatial and temporal dynamics of these infections are poorly understood.
9803,"Therefore, we inoculated ferrets with seasonal H3N2, pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus and performed detailed virological and pathological analyses at time points from 0.5 to 14 days post inoculation (dpi), as well as describing clinical signs and hematological parameters."
9804,H3N2 infection was restricted to the nose and peaked at 1 dpi.
9805,"pH1N1 infection also peaked at 1 dpi, but occurred at similar levels throughout the respiratory tract."
9806,"H5N1 infection occurred predominantly in the alveoli, where it peaked for a longer period, from 1 to 3 dpi."
9807,"The associated lesions followed the same spatial distribution as virus infection, but their severity peaked between 1 and 6 days later."
9808,Neutrophil and monocyte counts in peripheral blood correlated with inflammatory cell influx in the alveoli.
9809,"Of the different parameters used to measure lower respiratory tract disease, relative lung weight and affected lung tissue allowed the best quantitative distinction between the virus groups."
9810,"There was extra-respiratory spread to more tissues—including the central nervous system—for H5N1 infection than for pH1N1 infection, and to none for H3N2 infection."
9811,"This study shows that seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic influenza viruses differ strongly in the spatial and temporal dynamics of infection in the respiratory tract and extra-respiratory tissues of ferrets."
9812,Many new and emerging RNA and DNA viruses are zoonotic or have zoonotic origins in an animal reservoir that is usually mammalian and sometimes avian.
9813,Not all zoonotic viruses are transmissible (directly or by an arthropod vector) between human hosts.
9814,Virus genome sequence data provide the best evidence of transmission.
9815,"Of human transmissible virus, 37 species have so far been restricted to self-limiting outbreaks."
9816,These viruses are priorities for surveillance because relatively minor changes in their epidemiologies can potentially lead to major changes in the threat they pose to public health.
9817,"On the basis of comparisons across all recognized human viruses, we consider the characteristics of these priority viruses and assess the likelihood that they will further emerge in human populations."
9818,We also assess the likelihood that a virus that can infect humans but is not capable of transmission (directly or by a vector) between human hosts can acquire that capability.
9819, Phenothiazine and derivatives were tested for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication.
9820,Phenothiazine slightly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in a neutral red (NR) uptake assay.
9821,"Adding a propylamino group to give promazine reduced virus yields (VYR assay) with an EC90 =8.3±2.8μM, but without selectivity."
9822,Various substitutions in the basic phenothiazine structure did not promote efficacy.
9823,Phenazine ethosulfate was the most potent compound by VYR assay (EC90 =6.1±4.3μM).
9824,All compounds were toxic (IC50 =6.6–74.5μM) except for phenoxathiin (IC50 =858±208μM) and 10-(alpha-diethylamino-propionyl) phenothiazine·HCl (IC50 =195±71.2μM).
9825,"Consequently, none were selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication (SI values <1–3.3μM)."
9826,These data portended the poor efficacy of promazine in a SARS-CoV mouse lung replication model.
9827,"Intraperitoneal treatment with promazine using a prophylactic (−4h)/therapeutic regimen of 1, 10, or 50mg/(kgday) did not reduce virus lung titers at day 3, yet prolonged virus replication to 14 days."
9828,Similar therapeutic promazine doses were not efficacious.
9829,"Thus, promazine did not affect SARS-CoV replication in vitro or in vivo, nor were any other phenothiazines efficacious in reducing virus replication."
9830,"Therefore, treating SARS infections with compounds like promazine is not warranted."
9831,"Viruses may be regarded as dynamic nucleoprotein assemblies capable of assisted multiplication within cells, and of propagation between cells and organisms."
9832,"Infectious virus particles (virions) assembled in a host cell are dynamic, generally metastable particles: They are robust enough to protect the viral genome outside the cell, but are also poised to undergo structural changes and execute mechanochemical actions required for infection of other cells."
9833,"This chapter provides an introduction to the structural and physical biology of viruses by including: (i) an elementary overview on virions and the structural basis of virus function; (ii) a concise summary on basic techniques used in structural or physical virology; (iii) brief structure-based general descriptions of the different stages in the virus cycle, especially those in which virions and/or their components are involved."
9834,These contents may facilitate a better understanding of the specialized subjects treated in the rest of the book.
9835,This chapter is also intended as a “road map” to help interconnect and integrate in a single picture the different topics described in depth in the 21 monographic chapters in this book.
9836,"  Defective interfering (DI) particles are subgenomic deletion mutants generated from the infectious virus genomes, generally by replicase errors."
9837,"DI particles and related satellite genomes of the plant RNA viruses are generated by a wide variety of animal, plant, and fungal viruses."
9838,The ubiquity of DI viruses was first clearly recognized by Huang and Baltimore.
9839,"They proposed and defined the term “DI particle” to include defective viruses containing only some portion of the infectious virus genome, requiring homologous parental virus as a helper for the replication, containing virus structural proteins and antigens, and exhibiting the capacity to replicate preferentially at the expense of infectious helper virus in cells infected by both."
9840,"Satellite RNAs of plants are small RNAs that usually share little or no homology with their helper viruses, although some do exhibit some sequence homology with their helper viruses, and thus resemble DI particles in at least a portion of their genomes."
9841,"Depending on the leaving sites and resumption sites, DI particles can be produced that are simple internal deletions of the virus genome, simple deletions with a new terminus, or complex or bizarre genomes with multiple rearrangements of the virus segments."
9842,DI viruses and defective viruses generally are widespread in nature.
9843,Laboratory studies show that they can sometimes exert powerful disease-modulating effects (either attenuation or intensification of symptoms).
9844,"Their role in nature remains largely unexplored, despite the recent suggestive evidence for their importance in a number of systems."
9845," Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) is a small plant monomeric lectin, 8.7kDa in size, with an N-acetylglucosamine specificity that inhibits viruses from Nidovirales in vitro."
9846,"In the current study, we first examined the efficacy of UDA on the replication of different SARS-CoV strains in Vero 76 cells."
9847,UDA inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner and reduced virus yields of the Urbani strain by 90% at 1.1±0.4μg/ml in Vero 76 cells.
9848,"Then, UDA was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model."
9849,"BALB/c mice were infected with two LD50 (575PFU) of virus for 4h before the mice were treated intraperitoneally with UDA at 20, 10, 5 or 0mg/kg/day for 4 days."
9850,"Treatment with UDA at 5mg/kg significantly protected the mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (p <0.001), but did not significantly reduce virus lung titers."
9851,All virus-infected mice receiving UDA treatments were also significantly protected against weight loss (p <0.001).
9852,UDA also effectively reduced lung pathology scores.
9853,"At day 6 after virus exposure, all groups of mice receiving UDA had much lower lung weights than did the placebo-treated mice."
9854,"Thus, our data suggest that UDA treatment of SARS infection in mice leads to a substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death and weight loss."
9855,"Furthermore, the mode of action of UDA in vitro was further investigated using live SARS-CoV Urbani strain virus and retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S)."
9856,"UDA specifically inhibited the replication of live SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus when added just before, but not after, adsorption."
9857,"These data suggested that UDA likely inhibits SARS-CoV infection by targeting early stages of the replication cycle, namely, adsorption or penetration."
9858,"In addition, we demonstrated that UDA neutralizes the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein."
9859,"Finally, the target molecule for the inhibition of virus replication was partially characterized."
9860,"When UDA was exposed to N-acetylglucosamine and then UDA was added to cells just prior to adsorption, UDA did not inhibit the virus infection."
9861,"These data support the conclusion that UDA might bind to N-acetylglucosamine-like residues present on the glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, thereby preventing virus attachment to cells."
9862, Some viruses have the ability to modulate the development of autoimmune diseases.
9863,"Virus infections have long been associated with the exacerbation of autoimmune disease, however, there is also evidence that viruses can actually protect against autoimmune disease."
9864,Several experimental models have been developed to investigate how some virus infections can prime for and trigger autoimmunity whereas others ameliorate the pathway leading to clinical disease.
9865,"It is possible that the type I interferons, via interleukin 12, provide the link between viruses and autoimmunity."
9866,"An adenovirus 5 vector encoding for mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 (mDEF201) was evaluated for efficacy against lethal vaccinia virus (WR strain) respiratory infections in mice."
9867,mDEF201 was administered as a single intranasal treatment either prophylactically or therapeutically at doses of 10(6) to 10(8) plaque forming units/mouse.
9868,"When the prophylactic treatment was given at 56 days prior to infection, it protected 90% of animals from death (100% protection for treatments given between 1–49 days pre-infection), with minimal weight loss occurring during infection."
9869,"Surviving animals re-challenged with virus 22 days after the primary infection were protected from death, indicating that mDEF201 did not compromise the immune response against the initial infection."
9870,"Post-exposure therapy was given between 6–24 h after vaccinia virus exposure and protection was afforded by a 10(8) dose of mDEF201 given at 24 h, whereas a 10(7) dose was effective up to 12 h. Comparisons were made of the ability of mDEF201, given either 28 or 1 day prior to infection, to inhibit tissue virus titers and lung infection parameters."
9871,"Lung, liver, and spleen virus titers were inhibited to nearly the same extent by either treatment, as were lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores (indicators of pneumonitis)."
9872,"Lung virus titers were significantly (>100-fold) lower than in the placebo group, and the other infection parameters in mDEF201 treated mice were nearly at baseline."
9873,"In contrast, viral titers and lung infection parameters were high in the placebo group on day 5 of the infection."
9874,These results demonstrate the long-acting prophylactic and treatment capacity of mDEF201 to combat vaccinia virus infections.
9875,"Plant viruses can emerge into crops from wild plant hosts, or conversely from domestic (crop) plants into wild hosts."
9876,"Changes in ecosystems, including loss of biodiversity and increases in managed croplands, can impact the emergence of plant virus disease."
9877,"Although data are limited, in general the loss of biodiversity is thought to contribute to disease emergence."
9878,"More in-depth studies have been done for human viruses, but studies with plant viruses suggest similar patterns, and indicate that simplification of ecosystems through increased human management may increase the emergence of viral diseases in crops."
9879," Porcine enterovirus 3 replicated in explants of fœtal pig intestine, as was shown using photosensitization with neutral red to distinguish between inoculum and progeny virus."
9880,Progeny virus titres reached 105–106/ml with 2–4 days' incubation.
9881,"Human coronavirus 229E, an enveloped, RNA-containing virus, causes respiratory illness in man and is serologically related to murine coronavirus JHM, which causes acute and chronic demyelination in rodents."
9882,229E displays a species-specific host range restriction whose genetic basis was studied in human-mouse hybrids.
9883,"229E replicated in human WI-38 cells but not in three mouse cell lines tested (RAG, LM/TK(−), and A9)."
9884,"Human coronavirus sensitivity (HCVS) was expressed as a dominant phenotype in hybrids, indicating that mouse cells do not actively suppress 229E replication."
9885,"HCVS segregated concordantly with the human chromosome 15 enzyme markers mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) and the muscle form of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), and analysis of hybrids containing an X/15 translocation [t(X;15)(p11;q11)] localized HCVS to the q11 → qter region of chromosome 15."
9886,"HCVS might code for a specific surface receptor, allowing 229E to be absorbed to and received within the host cell."
9887,"Although a very wide range of viral diseases exists in vertebrates, certain generalizations can be made regarding pathogenetic pathways on the molecular level."
9888,The presentation will focus on interactions of virions and their components with target cells.
9889,"Using coronaviruses as examples the changes in virulence have been traced back to single mutational events; recombination, however, is likely to be an alternative mechanism by which virus-host interactions (e.g."
9890,"the cell-, organ- or animal species-spectrum) can dramatically change."
9891,Receptor molecules are essential for the early interactions during infection and some ot these have been identified.
9892,"Events in the target cell and the host organism are discussed, and wherever possible, aspects of virus evolution and cooperation between infectious agents are highlighted."
9893,Emerging virus diseases are a major threat to human and veterinary public health.
9894,"With new examples occurring approximately one each year, the majority are viruses originating from an animal host."
9895,"Of the many factors responsible, changes to local ecosystems that perturb the balance between pathogen and principal host species is one of the major drivers, together with increasing urbanization of mankind and changes in human behavior."
9896,Many emerging viruses have RNA genomes and as such are capable of rapid mutation and selection of new variants in the face of environmental changes in host numbers and available target species.
9897,This review summarizes recent work on aspects of virus emergence and the current understanding of the molecular and immunological basis whereby viruses may cross between species and become established in new ecological niches.
9898,"Emergence is hard to predict, although mathematical modeling and spatial epidemiology have done much to improve the prediction of where emergence may occur."
9899,"However, much needs to be done to ensure adequate surveillance is maintained of animal species known to present the greatest risk thus increasing general alertness among physicians, veterinarians and those responsible for formulating public health policy."
9900,RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered process by which dsRNA is able to silence specific gene functions.
9901,"Although initially described in plants, nematodes and Drosophila, the process is currently considered to be an evolutionarily conserved process that is present in the entire eukaryotic kingdom in which its original function was as a defense mechanism against viruses and foreign nucleic acids."
9902,"Similarly to the silencing of genes by RNAi, viral functions can be also silenced by the same mechanism, through the introduction of specific dsRNA molecules into cells, where they are targeted to essential genes or directly to the viral genome in case RNA viruses, thus arresting viral replication."
9903,"Since the pioneering work of Elbashir and coworkers, who identified RNAi activity in mammalian cells, many publications have described the inhibition of viruses belonging to most if not all viral families, by targeting and silencing diverse viral genes as well as cell genes that are essential for virus replication."
9904,"Moreover, virus expression vectors were developed and used as vehicles with which to deliver siRNAs into cells."
9905,"This review will describe the use of RNAi to inhibit virus replication directly, as well as through the silencing of the appropriate cell functions."
9906,"Fatal human respiratory disease associated with the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic H5N1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology, including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate."
9907,"Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses."
9908,"Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics."
9909,"Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the HP H5N1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages, revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infections."
9910,"These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection."
9911,"In addition, primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung tissue."
9912,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission from dromedaries to humans has resulted in major outbreaks in the Middle East.
9913,"Although some other livestock animal species have been shown to be susceptible to MERS-CoV, it is not fully understood why the spread of the virus in these animal species has not been observed in the field."
9914,"In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV."
9915,"In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation."
9916,"However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose."
9917,"Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits."
9918,"Our data indicate that despite relatively high viral RNA levels produced, low levels of infectious virus are excreted in the upper respiratory tract of rabbits as compared to dromedary camels, thus resulting in a lack of viral transmission."
9919,Viruses have the capacity to induce alterations and degenerations of neurons by different direct and indirect mechanisms.
9920,"In the review, we have focused on some examples that may provide new avenues for treatment or altering the course of infections, i.e., antibodies to fusogenic virus membrane proteins, drugs that interfere with lipid metabolism, calcium channel blockers, immunoregulatory molecules, and, and inhibitors of excitotoxic amino acids."
9921,"Owing to their selectivity in attack on regions of nervous tissue, governed by viral factors and by routes of invasion, viral receptors or metabolic machineries of infected cells, certain viral infections show similarities in distribution of their resulting lesions in the nervous system to that of the common human neurodegenerative diseases (namely, motor neurons disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease)."
9922,"However, it should be emphasized that no infectious agent has as yet provided a complete animal model for any of these diseases, nor has any infectious agent been linked to them from observations on clinical or postomortem materials."
9923, Common marmosets are highly susceptible to several viral pathogens that exist as latent or subclinical infections in their natural reservoir hosts but cause severe disease or death when interspecies transmission occurs.
9924,"Examples of such viruses in marmosets are herpes simplex virus infections, parainfluenza virus 1 infections, and measles acquired from humans, Saimiriine herpesvirus 1 infection after transmission from squirrel monkeys, and infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus originating from mice."
9925,Other relevant viral infections causing spontaneous disease in common marmoset colonies include cowpox virus infections and paramyxovirus saguinus infections.
9926,Callitrichine herpesvirus 3 is a newly recognized lymphocryptovirus that is associated with the development of intestinal lymphoproliferative disease in common marmosets.
9927,"Most viral pathogens causing disease in common marmosets are potential zoonotic agents, and protective measures should be implemented when handling these small New World monkeys."
9928,"Avian influenza viruses sporadically cross the species barrier to mammals, including humans, in which they may cause epidemic disease."
9929,Recently such an epidemic occurred due to the emergence of avian influenza virus of the subtype H10N7 (Seal/H10N7) in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina).
9930,This epidemic caused high mortality in seals along the north-west coast of Europe and represented a potential risk for human health.
9931,"To characterize the spectrum of lesions and to identify the target cells and viral distribution, findings in 16 harbor seals spontaneously infected with Seal/H10N7 are described."
9932,The seals had respiratory tract inflammation extending from the nasal cavity to bronchi associated with intralesional virus antigen in respiratory epithelial cells.
9933,Virus infection was restricted to the respiratory tract.
9934,The fatal outcome of the viral infection in seals was most likely caused by secondary bacterial infections.
9935,"To investigate the pathogenic potential of H10N7 infection for humans, we inoculated the seal virus intratracheally into six ferrets and performed pathological and virological analyses at 3 and 7 days post inoculation."
9936,"These experimentally inoculated ferrets displayed mild clinical signs, virus excretion from the pharynx and respiratory tract inflammation extending from bronchi to alveoli that was associated with virus antigen expression exclusively in the respiratory epithelium."
9937,Virus was isolated only from the respiratory tract.
9938,"In conclusion, Seal/H10N7 infection in naturally infected harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets shows that respiratory epithelial cells are the permissive cells for viral replication."
9939,Fatal outcome in seals was caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia similar to that in fatal human cases during influenza pandemics.
9940,Productive infection of ferrets indicates that seal/H10N7 may possess a zoonotic potential.
9941,This outbreak of LPAI from wild birds to seals demonstrates the risk of such occasions for mammals and thus humans.
9942,Pangolins are endangered animals in urgent need of protection.
9943,Identifying and cataloguing the viruses carried by pangolins is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential pathogens and help with conservation.
9944,This study provides insight into viral communities of Malayan Pangolins (Manis javanica) as well as the molecular epidemiology of dominant pathogenic viruses between Malayan Pangolin and other hosts.
9945,"A total of 62,508 de novo assembled contigs were constructed, and a BLAST search revealed 3600 ones (≥300 nt) were related to viral sequences, of which 68 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses, while dominant viruses were the Sendai virus and Coronavirus."
9946,"This is the first report on the viral diversity of pangolins, expanding our understanding of the virome in endangered species, and providing insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into other mammals."
9947,  This chapter discusses the newer modifications of immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) methods in both plant and animal virology.
9948,ISEM methods presented in the chapter include all the techniques where the “solid phase principle” is essential in a way similar to other solid phase immunoassays.
9949,These methods include (1) the antibody-coated grid technique (AB-CGT); (2) the protein A-coated grid technique (PA-CGT); (3) the protein A-coated bacteria technique (PA-CBT); and (4) the antigen-coated grid technique (AG-CGT).
9950,"In all ISEM methods, one of the components of the system is adsorbed to a solid phase."
9951,"In AG-CGT, PA-CGT, and AB-CGT, one of the reagents is adsorbed to an electron microscopic grid, while in PA-CBT protein A is naturally present on the surface of a bacterium that serves as a solid support."
9952,"In ISEM methods, the viruses can be statistically evaluated and numerically expressed as number of virions per unit of area, and can, therefore, be statistically evaluated."
9953,"Thus, these methods optimize the results of a test by quantifying the effects of the quality of the supporting grid, the time of adsorption, the pH, the presence of salts, and the type of staining."
9954,"The ISEM also permits a detailed study of antigenic variations in the same genus of virus, and thus would visually pinpoint the type or strain differences."
9955,"Recently, we and others obtained experimental evidence that highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5 can acquire the ability to transmit via aerosols between ferrets."
9956,"Upon submission of manuscripts describing the results of these studies, the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity was consulted and recommended that the main conclusions of the work be published but without the experimental details and mutation data that would enable replication of the experiments."
9957,"Over the past few months, these events have led to intense discussions."
9958,Should this type of experiment be conducted?
9959,"If so, under what conditions?"
9960,Do the scientific and public health benefits of the work and its publication outweigh the potential risks?
9961,"In February 2012, public health and influenza experts discussed these issues during a World Health Organization–organized technical consultation."
9962,This perspective article reviews the current state of the field and the recommendations made during the meeting.
9963," Hiltonol®, (Poly IC:LC), a potent immunomodulator, is a synthetic, double-stranded polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly IC) stabilized with Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose (LC)."
9964,Hiltonol® was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model.
9965,"Hiltonol® at 5, 1, 0.5 or 0.25 mg/kg/day by intranasal (i.n.)"
9966,route resulted in significant survival benefit when administered at selected times 24 h prior to challenge with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
9967,The infected BALB/c mice receiving the Hiltonol® treatments were also significantly effective in protecting mice against weight loss due to infection (p < 0.001).
9968,"Groups of 20 mice were dosed with Hiltonol® at 2.5 or 0.75 mg/kg by intranasal instillation 7, 14, and 21 days before virus exposure and a second dose was given 24 h later, prophylactic Hiltonol® treatments (2.5 mg/kg/day) were completely protective in preventing death, and in causing significant reduction in lung hemorrhage scores, lung weights and lung virus titers."
9969,Hiltonol® was also effective as a therapeutic when give up to 8 h post virus exposure; 100% of the-infected mice were protected against death when Hiltonol® was administered at 5 mg/kg/day 8 h after infection.
9970,Our data suggest that Hiltonol® treatment of SARS-CoV infection in mice leads to substantial prophylactic and therapeutic effects and could be used for treatment of other virus disease such as those caused by MERS-CoV a related coronavirus.
9971,These properties might be therapeutically advantageous if Hiltonol® is considered for possible clinical use.
9972,"Viral infections of laboratory mice have considerable impact on research results, and prevention of such infections is therefore of crucial importance."
9973,"This chapter covers infections of mice with the following viruses: herpesviruses, mousepox virus, murine adenoviruses, polyomaviruses, parvoviruses, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mammalian orthoreovirus serotype 3, murine hepatitis virus, murine norovirus, murine pneumonia virus, murine rotavirus, Sendai virus, and Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus."
9974,"For each virus, there is a description of the agent, epizootiology, clinical symptoms, pathology, methods of diagnosis and control, and its impact on research."
9975,PA-X is a novel discovered accessory protein encoded by the PA mRNA.
9976,Our previous study demonstrated that PA-X decreases the virulence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 in mice.
9977,"However, the underlying mechanism of virulence attenuation associated with PA-X is still unknown."
9978,"In this study, we compared two PA-X-deficient mutant viruses and the parental virus in terms of induction of pathology and manipulation of host response in the mouse lung, stimulation of cell death and PA nuclear accumulation."
9979,We first found that down-regulated PA-X expression markedly aggravated the acute lung injury of the infected mice early on day 1 post-infection (p.i.).
9980,"We then determined that loss of PA-X expression induced higher levels of cytokines, chemokines and complement-derived peptides (C3a and C5a) in the lung, especially at early time point’s p.i."
9981,"In addition, in vitro assays showed that the PA-X-deficient viruses enhanced cell death and increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian cells."
9982,"Moreover, we also found that PA nuclear accumulation of the PA-X-null viruses accelerated in MDCK cells."
9983,"These results demonstrate that PA-X decreases the level of complement components, ROS, cell death and inflammatory response, which may together contribute to the alleviated lung injury and the attenuation of the virulence of H5N1 virus in mice."
9984,"There have been many attempts to isolate infectious agents from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and many viruses have been incriminated at one time or another over the past few decades."
9985,"However, in every case further research has disproved the original claim."
9986,"Thus, we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of three patients with MS and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
9987,"The patients yielding the isolates from their CSF possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood, in contrast to several other virus-free patients with chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases studied at the same time."
9988,The virus could not be isolated from 27 patients who were not suffering from chronic disease of the CNS.
9989,"The agent has not yet been adequately characterized, but it deserves further attention because it seems to be a hitherto unknown virus, difficult to isolate and difficult to work with in the laboratory."
9990,Its isolation from the four patients mentioned above (and subsequently in several other MS patients) warrants further investigation of its potential role in MS and other progressive diseases of the CNS.
9991," This chapter describes methods for growing, purifying, counting, and characterizing viruses."
9992,It also provides general principles of diagnostic virology.
9993,"As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses require cell in which to replicate."
9994,The cells must express appropriate receptors and other proteins required by the virus.
9995,Cultured cells are often used to study basic steps in virus replication.
9996,Viruses can be purified away from cellular proteins and organelles using centrifugation techniques.
9997,"Most viruses cannot be seen using standard light microscopes, but are often imaged using electron microscopy."
9998,Methods that combine image collection and computationally demanding image processing can provide incredible details about virus architecture.
9999,Another common way to visualize viruses is to use fluorescent tags or dyes.
10000,"Although these techniques do not show detailed virus structures, they can be used to follow the progress of a virus through a cell and can provide a direct window into protein–protein interactions required for virus replication."
10001,A more indirect method to detect viruses is to look for virally induced changes to cell morphology.
10002,A variety of basic biochemical techniques are useful for analyzing viral proteins and nucleic acids.
10003,"As the viral genomes are relatively simple, they can be manipulated/mutated to study the function of virtually any viral protein."
10004,Powerful genetic techniques can also be used to generate “designer” cells or organisms.
10005,There are a variety of methods for quantitating viruses.
10006,Infectivity assays measure the ability of a virus to productively infect a cell.
10007,Techniques that identify specific viral proteins or genomes provide ways to rapidly identify viruses.
10008,"Some of these assays can be used at the bedside, or in the field."
10009,"Powerful and inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies are being used to identify new viruses, many of which could not be found by other methods."
10010,The challenge is to understand how or if these viruses impact their hosts.
10011," Because of the conflicting data concerning the SARS-CoV inhibitory efficacy of ribavirin, an inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase inhibitor, studies were done to evaluate the efficacy of ribavirin and other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR), mizoribine, and mycophenolic acid) in preventing viral replication in the lungs of BALB/c mice, a replication model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (Subbarao, K., McAuliffe, J., Vogel, L., Fahle, G., Fischer, S., Tatti, K., Packard, M., Shieh, W.J., Zaki, S., Murphy, B., 2004."
10012,Prior infection and passive transfer of neutralizing antibody prevent replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the respiratory tract of mice.
10013,J. Virol.
10014,"78, 3572–3577)."
10015,Ribavirin given at 75mg/kg 4h prior to virus exposure and then given twice daily for 3 days beginning at day 0 was found to increase virus lung titers and extend the length of time that virus could be detected in the lungs of mice.
10016,Other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors administered near maximum tolerated doses using the same dosing regimen as for ribavirin were found to slightly enhance virus replication in the lungs.
10017,"In addition, ribavirin treatment seemed also to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 4 days after cessation of treatment, although after 3 days of treatment ribavirin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production in infected mice, significantly reducing the levels of the cytokines IL-1α, interleukin-5 (IL-5), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)."
10018,These findings suggest that ribavirin may actually contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV by prolonging and/or enhancing viral replication in the lungs.
10019,"By not inhibiting viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, ribavirin treatment may have provided a continual source of stimulation for the inflammatory response thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection."
10020,Our data do not support the use of ribavirin or other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors for treating SARS infections in humans.
10021,  This chapter reviews two of the most widely studied animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease.
10022,These are Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus and murine hepatitis virus.
10023,Both viruses produce acute inflammatory encephalitis that is followed by chronic central-nervous-system (CNS) demyelinating disease.
10024,The clinical and pathologic correlates of virus-induced demyelination are largely immune mediated.
10025,"Furthermore, several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of myelin damage and neurologic deficits, and each of the proposed mechanisms may play a role in disease progression depending on the genetic constitution of the infected animal."
10026,The induction of demyelinating disease by virus may be directly relevant to human MS. Several viruses are known to cause demyelination in humans and viral infection is an epidemiologic factor that is consistently associated with clinical exacerbation of MS.
10027,"It is suggested that viral infection may be a cause of MS, although no specific virus has been identified as a causative agent."
10028,Mouse hepatitis virus causes a chronic demyelinating disease in C57BL/6 mice.
10029,"While early studies suggested demyelination is due to direct cytolytic effects of virus on oligodendrocytes, there is increasing evidence for the involvement of the immune system in the mechanism of demyelination."
10030,In this study we have asked whether demyelination can occur in the absence of functional MHC class I expression and CD8+ T cells.
10031,We infected transgenic mice lacking expression of β 2 microglobulin (β 2M−/− mice) with MHV-A59.
10032,"In β 2M−/− mice, virus was much more lethal than in either of the parental strains used to produce the mice; furthermore, while clearance from the CNS did occur in β 2M−/− mice, it was slower than in C57BL/6 mice."
10033,This is consistent with the importance of CD8+ cells in viral clearance.
10034,"Because of the increased sensitivity of the β 2M−/− mice to infection, only low levels of virus could be used to evaluate chronic disease."
10035,"Even at these low levels, demyelination did occur in some animals."
10036,"To compare infection in β 2M−/− and C57BL/6 mice we used a higher dose of an attenuated variant of MHV-A59, C12."
10037,"The attenuated variant induced less demyelination in C57BL/6 mice compared to wild type A59, but the levels observed were not significantly different from those seen in β 2M−/− mice."
10038,"Thus, MHV-induced demyelination can occur in some animals in the absence of MHC class I and CD8+ cells."
10039,"Closing the gap: the challenges in converging theoretical, computational, experimental and real-life studies in virus evolution"
10040,"Surveillance and monitoring of viral pathogens circulating in humans and wildlife, together with the identification of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), are critical for the prediction of future disease outbreaks and epidemics at an early stage."
10041,It is advisable to sample a broad range of vertebrates and invertebrates at different temporospatial levels on a regular basis to detect possible candidate viruses at their natural source.
10042,"However, virus surveillance systems can be expensive, costly in terms of finances and resources and inadequate for sampling sufficient numbers of different host species over space and time."
10043,"Recent publications have presented the concept of a new virus surveillance system, coining the terms “flying biological syringes”, “xenosurveillance” and “vector-enabled metagenomics”."
10044,"According to these novel and promising surveillance approaches, viral metagenomics on engorged mosquitoes might reflect the viral diversity of numerous mammals, birds and humans, combined in the mosquitoes’ blood meal during feeding on the host."
10045,"In this review article, we summarize the literature on vector-enabled metagenomics (VEM) techniques and its application in disease surveillance in humans."
10046,"Furthermore, we highlight the combination of VEM and “invertebrate-derived DNA” (iDNA) analysis to identify the host DNA within the mosquito midgut."
10047,"Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to treat individuals infected with new and re-emerging viruses, or with viruses that have developed resistance to antiviral therapies."
10048,"Mammalian natural host defense peptides (mNHP) are short, usually cationic, peptides that have direct antimicrobial activity, and which in some instances activate cell-mediated antiviral immune responses."
10049,"Although mNHP have potent activity in vitro, efficacy trials in vivo of exogenously provided mNHP have been largely disappointing, and no mNHP are currently licensed for human use."
10050,"Mastoparan is an invertebrate host defense peptide that penetrates lipid bilayers, and we reasoned that a mastoparan analog might interact with the lipid component of virus membranes and thereby reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses."
10051,"Our objective was to determine whether mastoparan-derived peptide MP7-NH(2) could inactivate viruses of multiple types, and whether it could stimulate cell-mediated antiviral activity."
10052,We found that MP7-NH(2) potently inactivated a range of enveloped viruses.
10053,"Consistent with our proposed mechanism of action, MP7-NH(2) was not efficacious against a non-enveloped virus."
10054,"Pre-treatment of cells with MP7-NH(2) did not reduce the amount of virus recovered after infection, which suggested that the primary mechanism of action in vitro was direct inactivation of virus by MP7-NH(2)."
10055,These results demonstrate for the first time that a mastoparan derivative has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and suggest that further investigation of the antiviral properties of mastoparan peptides in vivo is warranted.
10056, Experimental evolution permits exploring the effect of controlled environmental variables in virus evolution.
10057,Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field.

10062,Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses.
10063,The possibilities of using experimental evolution to understand virus behavior are still largely unexploited.
10064,"To support their replication, viruses take advantage of numerous cellular factors and processes."
10065,"Recent large-scale screens have identified hundreds of such factors, yet little is known about how viruses exploit any of these."
10066,"Influenza virus infection post-translationally activates P58(IPK), a cellular inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated eIF2α kinase, PKR."
10067,"Here, we report that infection of P58(IPK) knockout mice with influenza virus resulted in increased lung pathology, immune cell apoptosis, PKR activation, and mortality."
10068,"Analysis of lung transcriptional profiles, including those induced by the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus, revealed increased expression of genes associated with the cell death, immune, and inflammatory responses."
10069,These experiments represent the first use of a mammalian infection model to demonstrate the role of P58(IPK) in the antiviral response.
10070,"Our results suggest that P58(IPK) represents a new class of molecule, a cellular inhibitor of the host defense (CIHD), as P58(IPK) is activated during virus infection to inhibit virus-induced apoptosis and inflammation to prolong host survival, even while prolonging viral replication."
10071, Intracerebral inoculation of weanling Lewis rats with measles virus led to the development of subacute measles encephalomyelitis (SAME) 4–8 weeks after infection.
10072,The disease is characterized pathologically by an intense inflammatory infiltration within both the white and grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS) without apparent demyelination.
10073,Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP).
10074,MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population.
10075,They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer.
10076,The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE.
10077,A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME.
10078,These results indicate that autoimmune reactions to brain antigen can arise during measles virus infection which may contribute to the pathogenesis of measles virus-associated encephalomyelitis.
10079, Experimental evolution permits exploring the effect of controlled environmental variables in virus evolution.
10080,Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field.

10087,The cure effect of a virus model with both cell-to-cell transmission and cell-to-virus transmission is studied.
10088,"By the method of next generation matrix, the basic reproduction number is obtained."
10089,The locally asymptotic stability of the virus-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium is considered by investigating the characteristic equation of the model.
10090,"The globally asymptotic stability of the virus-free equilibrium is proved by constructing suitable Lyapunov function, and the sufficient condition for the globally asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is obtained by constructing suitable Lyapunov function and using LaSalle invariance principal."
10091, Background: Respiratory viral infection is known clinically to promote sensitization to antigen inhalation and the development of asthma.
10092,Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether influenza type A virus infection enhances inhalation sensitization and increases airway responsiveness in mice.
10093,Methods: Mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with influenza A viruses (strains: H1 N1 and H3 N2 ) or PBS.
10094,Animals were exposed to aerosols of ovalbumin on day 3.
10095,"Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with ovalbumin aerosols; 24 hours later, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined."
10096,Results: Neither influenza A virus (H1 N1 nor H3 N2 ) alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone caused changes in AR or IgE.
10097,"However, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with either influenza A virus increased AR and levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE."
10098,"On BALF-cell analysis, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A increased the number of lymphocytes but not the number of eosinophils."
10099,No difference in AR or IgE levels was observed between the 2 strains of influenza A viruses.
10100,"Immmunostaining of BALF cells showed an increase in T cells, especially CD8+ cells, with ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A."
10101,Conclusion: Infection by influenza A virus enhances sensitization to inhaled antigens and airway responsiveness in mice by means of mechanisms including CD8+ cells and antigen-specific IgE.

10103,Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are a natural byproduct of influenza A virus (IAV) replication.
10104,"DIPs interfere with the propagation and spread of infectious standard virus (STV), reduce virus yields by competing for viral and cellular resources, and induce antiviral responses."
10105,These properties open exciting possibilities for the development of DIP-based antivirals.
10106,"Exploring options for cell culture-based DIP production, we have established a fully continuous cultivation process, where one bioreactor is used to grow cells that are fed to two bioreactors operated in parallel for virus production."
10107,This system allows head-to-head comparisons of STV and DIP replication dynamics over extended time periods.
10108,"Cultivations were performed at two residence times (RT, 22 and 36 h) using MDCK suspension cells grown in a fully defined medium."
10109,"For infection, we used a virus seed generated by reverse genetics containing STVs and a known DIP carrying a deletion in segment 1 (delS1(1))."
10110,"Four days post infection, DIPs achieved maximum concentrations of 7.0·10(9) virions/mL and 8.4·10(9) virions/mL for RTs of 22 and 36 h, respectively."
10111,"Furthermore, oscillations in virus titers with two to three maxima were found for DIP accumulation at 36 and 22 h RT, respectively."
10112,"To complement the study, a basic mathematical model using simple kinetics and a reasonable number of parameters to describe DIP-propagation in continuous cultures was established."
10113,"Upon fitting the model individually to each of the two data sets, oscillations in the viral dynamics and the cell population dynamics were described well."
10114,Modeling suggests that both STV inactivation and virus degradation have to be taken into account to achieve good agreement of simulations and experimental data for longer RTs.
10115,"Together, the high DIP titers obtained, and the successful simulation of the experimental data showed that the combination of continuous bioreactors and mathematical models can enable studies regarding DIP dynamics over extended time periods and allow large scale manufacturing of DIP-based antivirals."
10116,"The emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in commercial swine in North America and growing concerns about the potential for the introduction of African swine fever (ASF) from China, the European Union, or other affected regions has put a spotlight on the possible role of contaminated feed and feed ingredients in the introduction and transmission of viral swine pathogens."
10117,This paper systematically reviews the scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States.
10118,"The purpose of this review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant scientific knowledge, published through March 2018, and to identify information gaps and research needs, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to policy makers, the swine industry, and the scientific community."
10119,"A total of 26 documents were selected for the final review process, which included experimental studies, case reports, epidemiological investigations, and scientific opinion, among others."
10120,"The review found that the scientific literature has addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, but the current body of scientific knowledge lacks conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed, particularly for imported commodities, and further investigation into the epidemiology of virus transmission via feed to swine under field conditions through natural feeding behavior is warranted."
10121,"Additional studies of how imported ingredients of commercial swine feed are sourced, processed, transported and, thus, contaminated prior to importation into the United States are needed."
10122,"Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and subsequent virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research."
10123, Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) have a wide range of geographic distribution and have been isolated from humans and various animals.
10124,"This study describes the isolation, molecular characterization and analysis of pathogenicity of MRV variant B/03 from wild short-nosed fruit bats."
10125,Negative stain electron microscopy illustrated that the B/03 strain is a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with a diameter of 70nm.
10126,Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) migration patterns showed that the B/03 viral genome contains 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement.
10127,The isolate belongs to MRV serotype 1 based on S1 gene nucleotide sequence data.
10128,BALB/c mice experimentally infected with B/03 virus by intranasal inoculation developed severe respiratory distress with tissue damage and inflammation.
10129,"Lastly, B/03 virus has an increased transmission risk between bats and humans or animals."

10131,"Viruses have been found to induce inflammatory demyelinating lesions in central nervous system (CNS) tissue of both animal and man, either by natural infections or after vaccination(1,2)."
10132,"At least two different pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed for these changes, a cytopathic viral infection of oligodendroglia cells with subsequent cell death, and a host immune reaction against virus and brain antigens."
10133,We now report the occurrence of cell-mediated immune reactions against basic myelin proteins in the course of coronavirus infections in Lewis rats.
10134,Infection of rats with the murine coronavirus JHM leads to demyelinating encephalomyelitis developing several weeks to months post-infection(3–7).
10135,"Lymphocytes from these diseased Lewis rats can be restimulated with basic myelin protein (BMP) and adoptive transfer of these cells leads to lesions resembling those of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in recipients, which can be accompanied by a mild clinical disease."
10136,This model demonstrates that a virus infection in CNS tissue is capable of initiating an autoimmune response which may be of pathogenic importance.
10137,Haunted with and hunting for viruses
10138,Several viruses cause pulmonary infections due to their shared tropism with cells of the respiratory tract.
10139,These respiratory problems due to viral infection become a public health concern due to rapid transmission through air/aerosols or via direct-indirect contact with infected persons.
10140,"In addition, the cross-species transmission causes alterations to viral genetic makeup thereby increasing the risk of emergence of pathogens with new and more potent infectivity."
10141,"With the introduction of effective nucleic acid-based technologies, post translational gene silencing (PTGS) is being increasingly used to silence viral gene targets and has shown promising approach towards management of many viral infections."
10142,"Since several host factors are also utilized by these viruses during various stages of infection, silencing these host factors can also serve as promising therapeutic tool."
10143,"Several nucleic acid-based technologies such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), and ribozymes have been studied and used against management of respiratory viruses."
10144,These therapeutic nucleic acids can be efficiently delivered through the airways.
10145,"Studies have also shown efficacy of gene therapy in clinical trials against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as models of respiratory diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles and influenza."
10146,"In this review, we have summarized some of the recent advancements made in the area of nucleic acid based therapeutics and highlighted the emerging roles of nucleic acids in the management of some of the severe respiratory viral infections."
10147,We have also focused on the methods of their delivery and associated challenges.
10148,Semen banking: consideration on viral contamination in the era of new emerging viral infection
10149,"The genus Orthopoxvirus contains several species of related viruses, including the causative agent of smallpox (Variola virus)."
10150,"In addition to smallpox, several other members of the genus are capable of causing human infection, including monkeypox, cowpox, and other zoonotic rodent-borne poxviruses."
10151,"Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification."
10152,We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes.
10153,The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system.
10154,"We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits."
10155,The assay is sensitive at the stochastic limit of PCR and detected virus in blood containing approximately six plaque-forming units per milliliter from a rabbitpox virus-infected rabbit.
10156," For transmission of a virus to occur, a virus must enter a host through a portal of entry, replicate or disseminate within the host, and be transmitted to a new host through a portal of exit."
10157,"Unless delivered directly into bodily tissues through a bite or needle, most viruses interact with the epithelium at the site of entry."
10158,"Localized infections replicate at the initial site of infection, while systemic infections spread to additional areas of the body."
10159,Viruses are shed into the environment most often through the same route they entered the body.
10160,The stability of virions within the environment is dependent upon virion and environmental factors.
10161,Epidemiology is the study of how diseases are transmitted through a population.
10162,Epidemiologists perform descriptive or analytic studies to characterize the chain of viral infection throughout a population and design control measures to interrupt it.
10163,We analyzed the virulence of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A viruses in vivo and in vitro.
10164,"Selected viruses isolated in 2009, 2010, 2014, and 2015 were assessed using an aerosol-mediated high-dose infection model for pigs as well as air-liquid interface cultures of differentiated airway epithelial cells."
10165,"Using a dyspnea score, rectal temperature, lung lesions, and viral load in the lung as parameters, the strains from 2014–2015 were significantly less virulent than the strains isolated in 2009–2010."
10166,"In vitro, the viruses from 2009–2010 also differed from the 2014–2015 viruses by increased release of infectious virus, a more pronounced loss of ciliated cells, and a reduced thickness of the epithelial cell layer."
10167,Our in vivo and in vitro results reveal an evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses toward lower virulence.
10168,Our in vitro culture system can be used to predict the virulence of influenza viruses.
10169,H9N2 viruses are the most widespread influenza viruses in poultry in Asia.
10170,We evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian H9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture.
10171,H9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of H9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung.
10172,This may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase (NA) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid (Sia) rather than carbon-3-linked Sia.
10173,"The modified cleavage of N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by NA in H9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics, and recombinant H9N2 viruses with amino acids (38KQ) deleted in the NA stalk, and changing the amino acid at position 431 from Proline-to-Lysine."
10174,"Using recombinant H9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret, we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures."
10175,The existing risk assessment models for H9N2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract.
10176,The inclusion of the human ex vivo cultures would further strengthen the future risk-assessment strategies.
10177, Respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV in humans are often accompanied by mild and self-limiting hepatitis.
10178,"As a respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to hepatitis, but the mechanism remains unclear."
10179,"This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of hepatitis by establishing a model for infected mice for three different subtypes of respiratory IAVs (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N2)."
10180,"Histological analysis was performed, and results showed increase serum aminotransferase (ALT and AST) levels and evident liver injury on days 3 and 7, especially on day 5 post infection."
10181,Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results indicated a wide distribution of IAV's positive signals in the liver of infected mice.
10182,Real-time PCR results further revealed a similar viral titer to IHC that presented a remarkedly positive correlation with histology injury.
10183,All these data showed that the mouse model suitably contributed valuable information about the mechanism underlying the occurrence of hepatitis induced by respiratory influenza virus.
10184,"A new influenza virus, genus D, isolated in US pigs and cattle, has also been circulating in cattle in France."
10185,"It was first identified there in 2011, and an increase was detected in 2014."
10186,"The virus genome in France is 94%–99% identical to its US counterpart, which suggests intercontinental spillover."
10187," Objective HSV-2 infection has increased significantly in recent years, which is closely associated with cervical cancer and HIV infection."
10188,The lack of success in vaccine development and the emergence of drug resistance to commonly used drugs emphasize the urgent need for alternative antivirals against HSV-2 infection.
10189,Arbidol (ARB) has been demonstrated to be a broad spectrum antiviral drug that exhibits immunomodulatory properties that affect the HSV-2 life cycle.
10190,This study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of ARB against HSV-2 in vivo and in vitro to further explore the clinical application of ARB.
10191,Methods The efficacy of ARB on HSV-2 infection in vitro was examined by CPE and MTT assays.
10192,"A vaginitis model was established to monitor changes in histopathology and inflammatory cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and TGF-β) expression by H&E staining and ELISA, respectively, and the efficacy of ARB was evaluated accordingly."
10193,"Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of the vaginitis animals."
10194,"Considering the balance of efficacy and pharmacokinetics, ARB ointment was strictly prepared to observe formulation efficacy differences compared to the oral dosing form."
10195,"Results The results showed that, in vitro, the TC50 and IC50 of ARB were 32.32 μg/mL and 4.77 μg/mL (SI = 6.82), respectively, indicating that ARB presents effective activity against HSV-2 in a dose-dependent manner."
10196,The results of the time-course assay suggested that 25 μg/mL ARB affected the late stage of HSV-2 replication.
10197,"However, ARB did not inhibit viral attachment or cell penetration."
10198,"The in vivo results showed that ARB ointment can improve the survival rate, prolong the survival time and reduce the reproductive tract injury in mice infected with HSV-2, regulate cytokine expression; and balance the CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral blood to participate in the regulation of immune response."
10199,Conclusion ARB showed anti-HSV-2 activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and played a role in inhibiting the late replication cycle of the virus.
10200,"The vaginitis model was successfully established, according to immunomodulation outcomes, responded better to ARB in ointment form than in oral form."
10201,: Experimental animal data show that protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is feasible.
10202,"For an effective immune prophylaxis in humans, broad coverage of different strains of SARS-CoV and control of potential neutralization escape variants will be required."
10203,"Combinations of virus-neutralizing, noncompeting mAbs may have these properties."
10204,METHODS AND FINDINGS: Human mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets.
10205,"We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus."
10206,In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318–510) harboring this mutation was abolished.
10207,We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS patient for antibodies complementary to CR3014.
10208,"A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3."
10209,No escape variants could be generated with CR3022.
10210,The mixture of both mAbs showed neutralization of SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain.
10211,"Dose reduction indices of 4.5 and 20.5 were observed for CR3014 and CR3022, respectively, at 100% neutralization."
10212,"Because enhancement of SARS-CoV infection by subneutralizing antibody concentrations is of concern, we show here that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS-CoV into a productive one."
10213,CONCLUSIONS: The combination of two noncompeting human mAbs CR3014 and CR3022 potentially controls immune escape and extends the breadth of protection.
10214,"At the same time, synergy between CR3014 and CR3022 may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection."
10215, This paper presents a quantitative assessment model for the risk of entry of zoonotic bat-borne viruses into the European Union (EU).
10216,"The model considers four routes of introduction: human travel, legal trade of products, live animal imports and illegal import of bushmeat and was applied to five virus outbreak scenarios."
10217,"Two scenarios were considered for Zaire ebolavirus (wEBOV, cEBOV) and other scenarios for Hendra virus, Marburg virus (MARV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
10218,The use of the same framework and generic data sources for all EU Member States (MS) allows for a relative comparison of the probability of virus introduction and of the importance of the routes of introduction among MSs.
10219,"According to the model wEBOV posed the highest risk of an introduction event within the EU, followed by MARV and MERS-CoV."
10220,"However, the main route of introduction differed, with wEBOV and MERS-CoV most likely through human travel and MARV through legal trade of foodstuffs."
10221,"The relative risks to EU MSs as entry points also varied between outbreak scenarios, highlighting the heterogeneity in global trade and travel to the EU MSs."
10222,"The model has the capability to allow for a continual updating of the risk estimate using new data as, and when, it becomes available."
10223,"The model provides an horizon scanning tool for use when available data are limited and, therefore, the absolute risk estimates often have high uncertainty."
10224,"Sensitivity analysis suggested virus prevalence in bats has a large influence on the results; a 90% reduction in prevalence reduced the risk of introduction considerably and resulted in the relative ranking of MARV falling below that for MERS-CoV, due to this parameter disproportionately affecting the risk of introduction from the trade route over human travel."
10225, The influenza A virus is notoriously known for its ability to cause recurrent epidemics and global pandemics.
10226,"Antiviral therapy is effective when treatment is initiated within 48h of symptom onset, and delaying treatment beyond this time frame is associated with decreased efficacy."
10227,Research on anti-inflammatory therapy to ameliorate influenza-induced inflammation is currently underway and seems important to the impact on the clinical outcome.
10228,Both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed.
10229,Current methods for evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs rely mostly on transformed cells and animals.
10230,Transformed cell models are distantly related to physiological and pathological conditions.
10231,"Although animals are the best choices for preclinical drug testing, they are not time- or cost-efficient."
10232,"In this study, we established an ex vivo model using mouse lung slices to evaluate both antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents against influenza virus infection."
10233,Both influenza virus PR8 (H1N1) and A/Human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2) can replicate efficiently in mouse lung slices and trigger significant cytokine and chemokine responses.
10234,"The induction of selected cytokines and chemokines were found to have a positive correlation between ex vivo and in vivo experiments, suggesting that the ex vivo cultured lung slices may closely resemble the lung functionally in an in vivo configuration when challenged by influenza virus."
10235,"Furthermore, a set of agents with known antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory activities were tested to validate the ex vivo model."
10236,"Our results suggested that mouse lung slices provide a robust, convenient and cost-efficient model for the assessment of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents against influenza virus infection in one assay."
10237,This ex vivo model may predict the efficacy of drug candidates’ antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities in vivo.
10238,Environmental survival and microbicide inactivation of coronaviruses
10239,"While coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 1."
10240,Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold.
10241,"This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers."
10242,By the use of a modified ionizer device we describe effective prevention of airborne transmitted influenza A (strain Panama 99) virus infection between animals and inactivation of virus (>97%).
10243,Active ionizer prevented 100% (4/4) of guinea pigs from infection.
10244,"Moreover, the device effectively captured airborne transmitted calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus, with recovery rates up to 21% after 40 min in a 19 m(3) room."
10245,"The ionizer generates negative ions, rendering airborne particles/aerosol droplets negatively charged and electrostatically attracts them to a positively charged collector plate."
10246,Trapped viruses are then identified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR.
10247,The device enables unique possibilities for rapid and simple removal of virus from air and offers possibilities to simultaneously identify and prevent airborne transmission of viruses.
10248," P/V gene substitutions convert the non-cytopathic paramyxovirus Simian Virus 5 (SV5), which is a poor inducer of host cell responses in human tissue culture cells, into a mutant (P/V-CPI−) that induces high levels of apoptosis, interferon (IFN)-beta, and proinflammatory cytokines."
10249,"However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined."
10250,"Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses."
10251,"In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses."
10252,"Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable."
10253,"In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI− viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis."
10254,"Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI− mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues."
10255,"There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI−, but not with WT rSV5."
10256,"Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system."
10257,We present a model for the effect of P/V gene substitutions on SV5 growth and immune responses in vivo.
10258, Viral myocarditis has been suggested as an etiology for cardiomyopathy in several mammalian species.
10259,"Myocarditis and idiopathic cardiomyopathy have been reported in the domestic cat, although a viral etiology has not been demonstrated."
10260,"Because of the continuing interest in the potential relationship between viral myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, we evaluated hearts from cats with spontaneous, idiopathic cardiomyopathy for viral genomic material within myocytes by polymerase chain reaction, and for the presence of myocarditis by light microscopy."
10261,Thirty-one (31) formalin-fixed hearts from domestic cats who died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy were randomly selected from pathology archives.
10262,Seventeen (17) formalin-fixed hearts from healthy cats were similarly selected as normal controls.
10263,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate myocardial tissue for the presence of viral genome from feline panleukopenia virus, herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus."
10264,Hearts were examined using light microscopy for histologic evidence of myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria.
10265,Panleukopenia virus was identified by PCR in 10 of 31 cats with cardiomyopathy but in none of the controls.
10266,"Neither cardiomyopathic or control cats tested positive by PCR for herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus."
10267,Myocarditis was detected by histologic examination in 18 of 31 cardiomyopathic cats and in none of 17 control cats.
10268,"Myocarditis and or feline panleukopenia virus genome was detected in felines with idiopathic hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, suggesting a possible role of viral infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in this species."
10269," A series of pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives T-705 (favipiravir), T-1105 and T-1106 were discovered to be candidate antiviral drugs."
10270,"These compounds have demonstrated good activity in treating viral infections in laboratory animals caused by various RNA viruses, including influenza virus, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)."
10271,"Treatment has in some cases been effective when initiated up to 5–7 days after virus infection, when the animals already showed signs of illness."
10272,"Studies on the mechanism of action of T-705 have shown that this compound is converted to the ribofuranosyltriphosphate derivative by host enzymes, and this metabolite selectively inhibits the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase without cytotoxicity to mammalian cells."
10273,"Interestingly, these compounds do not inhibit host DNA and RNA synthesis and inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity."
10274,"From in vivo studies using several animal models, the pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives were found to be effective in protecting animals from death, reducing viral burden, and limiting disease manifestations, even when treatment was initiated after virus inoculation."
10275,"Importantly, T-705 imparts its beneficial antiviral effects without significant toxicity to the host."
10276,"Prompt development of these compounds is expected to provide effective countermeasures against pandemic influenza virus and several bioweapon threats, all of which are of great global public health concern given the current paucity of highly effective broad-spectrum drugs."
10277, Isoflavones and their related flavonoid compounds exert antiviral properties in vitro and in vivo against a wide range of viruses.
10278,"Genistein is, by far, the most studied soy isoflavone in this regard, and it has been shown to inhibit the infectivity of enveloped or nonenveloped viruses, as well as single-stranded or double-stranded RNA or DNA viruses."
10279,"At concentrations ranging from physiological to supraphysiological (3.7–370 μM), flavonoids, including genistein, have been shown to reduce the infectivity of a variety of viruses affecting humans and animals, including adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and rotavirus."
10280,"Although the biological properties of the flavonoids are well studied, the mechanisms of action underlying their antiviral properties have not been fully elucidated."
10281,Current results suggest a combination of effects on both the virus and the host cell.
10282,"Isoflavones have been reported to affect virus binding, entry, replication, viral protein translation and formation of certain virus envelope glycoprotein complexes."
10283,"Isoflavones also affect a variety of host cell signaling processes, including induction of gene transcription factors and secretion of cytokines."
10284,"The efficacy of isoflavones and related flavonoids in virus infectivity in in vitro bioassays is dependent on the dose, frequency of administration and combination of isoflavones used."
10285,"Despite promising in vitro results, there is lack of data confirming the in vivo efficacy of soy isoflavones."
10286,"Thus, investigations using appropriate in vivo virus infectivity models to examine pharmacological and especially physiological doses of flavonoids are warranted."
10287,"On average, more than two new species of human virus are reported every year."
10288,We constructed the cumulative species discovery curve for human viruses going back to 1901.
10289,We fitted a statistical model to these data; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete.
10290,We generated a 95% credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38–562.
10291,We extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10–40 new species to be discovered by 2020.
10292,"Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning."
10293,"More systematic virus discovery programmes, covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses, should be considered."
10294,The mechanisms responsible for virulence of influenza viruses in humans remain poorly understood.
10295,A prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
10296,Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or reassortants of human influenza virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection.
10297,"However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), were largely limited to this group."
10298,Extrapulmonary pathology may thus contribute to the morbidities induced by H5N1 viruses.
10299,Bats are known to harbor multiple paramyxoviruses.
10300,"Despite the creation of two new genera, Aquaparamyxovirus and Ferlavirus, to accommodate this increasing diversity, several recently isolated or characterized viruses remain unclassified beyond the subfamily level."
10301,"In the present study, among 985 bats belonging to 6 species sampled in the Belinga caves of Gabon, RNA of an unclassified paramyxovirus (Belinga bat virus, BelPV) was discovered in 14 African sheath-tailed bats (Coleura afra), one of which exhibited several hemorrhagic lesions at necropsy, and viral sequence was obtained in two animals."
10302,"Phylogenetically, BelPV is related to J virus and Beilong virus (BeiPV), two other unclassified paramyxoviruses isolated from rodents."
10303,"In the diseased BelPV-infected C. afra individual, high viral load was detected in the heart, and the lesions were consistent with those reported in wild rodents and mice experimentally infected by J virus."
10304,"BelPV was not detected in other tested bat species sharing the same roosting sites and living in very close proximity with C. afra in the two caves sampled, suggesting that this virus may be host-specific for C. afra."
10305,The mode of transmission of this paramyxovirus in bat populations remains to be discovered.
10306, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be a threat to human health in the Middle East.
10307,"Development of countermeasures is ongoing; however, an animal model that faithfully recapitulates human disease has yet to be defined."
10308,A recent study indicated that inoculation of common marmosets resulted in inconsistent lethality.
10309,Based on these data we sought to compare two isolates of MERS-CoV.
10310,"We followed disease progression in common marmosets after intratracheal exposure with: MERS-CoV-EMC/2012, MERS-CoV-Jordan-n3/2012, media, or inactivated virus."
10311,"Our data suggest that common marmosets developed a mild to moderate non-lethal respiratory disease, which was quantifiable by computed tomography (CT), with limited other clinical signs."
10312,"Based on CT data, clinical data, and virological data, MERS-CoV inoculation of common marmosets results in mild to moderate clinical signs of disease that are likely due to manipulations of the marmoset rather than as a result of robust viral replication."
10313," Infection of adherent cell monolayers using a liquid inoculum represents an established method to reliably and quantitatively study virus infection, but poorly recapitulates the exposure and infection of cells in the respiratory tract that occurs during infection with aerosolized pathogens."
10314,"To better simulate natural infection in vitro, we adapted a system that generates viral aerosols similar to those exhaled by infected humans to the inoculation of epithelial cell monolayers."
10315,"Procedures for cellular infection and calculation of exposure dose were developed and tested using viruses characterized by distinct transmission and pathogenicity phenotypes: an HPAI H5N1, an LPAI H7N9, and a seasonal H3N2 virus."
10316,"While all three aerosolized viruses were highly infectious in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (Calu-3) cultured submerged in media, differences between the viruses were observed in primary human alveolar epithelial cells and in Calu-3 cells cultured at air-liquid interface."
10317,"This system provides a novel enhancement to traditional in vitro experiments, particularly those focused on the early stages of infection."
10318,: To investigate the effects and immunological mechanisms of the traditional Chinese medicine Xinjiaxiangruyin on controlling influenza virus (FM1 strain) infection in mice housed in a hygrothermal environment.
10319,"METHODS: Mice were housed in normal and hygrothermal environments, and intranasally infected with influenza virus (FM1)."
10320,A high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint of Xinjiaxiangruyin was used to provide an analytical method for quality control.
10321,"Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure messenger RNA expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in the lungs."
10322,"Western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 proteins."
10323,Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th17/T-regulatory cells.
10324,RESULTS: Xinjiaxiangruyin effectively alleviated lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice in hot and humid environments.
10325,Guizhimahuanggebantang significantly reduced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice.
10326,"The expression of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in lung tissue of WT mice in the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05)."
10327,"In WT mice exposed to the hot and humid environment, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in the XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group."
10328,"The expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in lung tissue of WT mice exposed to the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than those in the model group."
10329,"In WT mice exposed to hot and humid environments, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group."
10330,"CONCLUSION: Guizhimahuanggebantang demonstrated a satisfactory therapeutic effect on mice infected with the influenza A virus (FM1 strain) in a normal environment, and Xinjiaxiangruyin demonstrated a clear therapeutic effect in damp and hot environments and may play a protective role against influenza through downregulation of the TLR7 signal pathway."
10331,Paleovirology is the study of ancient viruses.
10332,"The existence of a paleovirus can sometimes be detected by virtue of its accidental insertion into the germline of different animal species, which allows one to date when the virus actually existed."
10333,"However, the ancient and the modern often connect, as modern viruses have unexpected origins that can be traced to ancient infections."
10334,"The genomes of two species of mongooses and an egg-laying mammal called an echidna show that a virus currently present in poultry, the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), is actually of ancient exotic mammalian origin."
10335,REV apparently spread to poultry through a circuitous route involving the isolation of malaria parasites from a pheasant from Borneo housed at the Bronx Zoo that was contaminated with REV.
10336,Repeated passage of this virus in poultry adapted the virus to its new host.
10337,"At some point, the virus got inserted into another virus, called fowlpox virus, which has spread back into the wild."
10338,"Although REV may still exist somewhere in a mammalian host, its modern form links an 8 million-year-old infection of the ancestor of a mongoose to a virus that now is circulating in wild birds through malaria studies in the mid-20(th) century."
10339,These lessons of ancient and modern viruses have implications for modern human pandemics from viral reservoirs and for human interventions that may come with unintended consequences.
10340,"We conducted a cross-sectional study in live bird markets (LBMs) in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, to estimate the prevalence of avian influenza A(H5) and A(H9) viruses in different types of poultry and environmental areas by using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression models."
10341,We detected these viruses in nearly all LBMs.
10342,"Prevalence of A(H5) virus was higher in waterfowl than in chickens, whereas prevalence of A(H9) virus was higher in chickens than in waterfowl and, among chicken types, in industrial broilers than in cross-breeds and indigenous breeds."
10343,LBMs with >1 wholesaler were more frequently contaminated by A(H5) virus than retail-only LBMs.
10344,Prevalence of A(H9) virus in poultry and level of environmental contamination were also higher in LBMs with >1 wholesaler.
10345,We found a high level of circulation of both avian influenza viruses in surveyed LBMs.
10346,"Prevalence was influenced by type of poultry, environmental site, and trading."
10347, Acute cough is a major symptom of viral respiratory tract infection and causes excessive morbidity in human populations across the world.
10348,A wide variety of viruses play a role in the development of cough after acute infection and all of these manifest a similar clinical picture across different age groups.
10349,Despite the large disease burden surprisingly little is known about the mechanism of acute cough following viral infection.
10350,"Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that increased production of neuropeptides and leukotrienes mediate cough after viral infection, along with altered expression of neural receptors."
10351,Increased airway mucus production is also likely to play a significant role.
10352,This work is reviewed in this article.
10353,Following the recent development of a mouse model for rhinovirus infection and the establishment of experimental models of rhinovirus challenge in human subjects with both asthma and COPD the field is expanding to translate in vitro research into clinical studies and hopefully eventually into clinical practice.
10354,Developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus induced cough may lead to more specific and effective therapies.
10355,: Junín virus (JUNV) and several other Clade B New World arenaviruses cause human disease ranging from mild febrile illness to severe viral hemorrhagic fever (HF).
10356,"These viruses pose a significant threat to national security and safe and effective therapies are limited outside of Argentina, where immune plasma is the standard of care for treating JUNV infection in cases of Argentine HF."
10357,"METHODS: An in vitro screen of the Chemtura library identified several compounds with activity against Tacaribe virus (TCRV), a Clade B arenavirus closely related to JUNV."
10358,"Of these compounds, D746, a phenolic dibenzylsulfide, was further pursued for additional in vitro studies and evaluated in the AG129 mouse TCRV infection model."
10359,RESULTS: D746 was found to act during an early to intermediate stage of the TCRV replication cycle and micromolar range activity was confirmed by virus yield reduction assays with both TCRV and JUNV.
10360,"Although intraperitoneal twice daily treatment regimens were found to be highly effective when started 2 hours prior to TCRV challenge in AG129 mice, post-exposure treatment initiated 3 days after infection was not efficacious."
10361,"Interestingly, despite the pre-exposure treatment success, D746 did not reduce serum or tissue virus titers during the acute infection."
10362,"Moreover, D746 elicited ascites fluid accumulation in mice during, as well as independent of, infection."
10363,CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that D746 may be altering the host response to TCRV infection in AG129 mice in a way that limits pathogenesis and thereby protects mice from otherwise lethal infection in the absence of measurable reductions in viral burden.
10364,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype often cause severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure in humans, with reported case fatality rates of more than 60%."
10365,"To develop a clinical antibody therapy, we generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) ch61 that showed strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in mouse and nonhuman primate models of H5N1 HPAI virus infections."
10366,"Passive immunization with MAb ch61 one day before or after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus completely protected mice, and partial protection was achieved when mice were treated 3 days after the challenge."
10367,"In a cynomolgus macaque model, reduced viral loads and partial protection against lethal infection were observed in macaques treated with MAb ch61 intravenously one and three days after challenge."
10368,Protective effects were also noted in macaques under immunosuppression.
10369,"Though mutant viruses escaping from neutralization by MAb ch61 were recovered from macaques treated with this MAb alone, combined treatment with MAb ch61 and peramivir reduced the emergence of escape mutants."
10370,Our results indicate that antibody therapy might be beneficial in reducing viral loads and delaying disease progression during H5N1 HPAI virus infection in clinical cases and combined treatment with other antiviral compounds should improve the protective effects of antibody therapy against H5N1 HPAI virus infection.
10371,Viral infections pose a potential threat to the health of laboratory and zoological colonies of nonhuman primates as well as the personnel involved in their care.
10372,This chapter discusses those viral diseases of importance to nonhuman primates and their caregivers by taxonomic family to which the causative agent is classified.
10373,"A doctrine of comparative virology is that infection of the immunocompetent, appropriate host often is associated with minimal disease, whereas infection of the inadvertent susceptible host can have devastating consequences."
10374,The likelihood of such transmission is increased when changes in the environment place different species in close proximity.
10375,"Similarly, transmission of viral agents from nonprimate host to primate host may result in severe disease."
10376,Perhaps of equal importance is the realization that experimental manipulations may inadvertently expose animals to unrecognized pathogens with lethal consequences.
10377,"For instance, a number of minimally pathogenic viruses may cause severe disease in animals immunosuppressed from pharmacologic manipulation or immunodeficient from concurrent infection with viruses that target the immune system."
10378,Numerous examples of each of these scenarios are documented within this chapter.
10379,"Nowadays, the metagenomic approach has been a very important tool in the discovery of new viruses in environmental and biological samples."
10380,Here we discuss how these discoveries may help to elucidate the etiology of diseases and the criteria necessary to establish a causal association between a virus and a disease.
10381,Genetically resistant G3H mice routinely yielded macrophages that were resistant when grown in 90% horse serum.
10382,"These mice also routinely yielded macrophages that were susceptible to the same virus, MHV (PRI), in vitro after the mice had been treated with three intraperitoneal doses, of hydrocortisone."
10383,"Dexamethasone and prednisolone when similarly administered also increased the susceptibility of C3H macrophages taken from the treated animal, but progesterone and testosterone did not."
10384,"In addition, spleen cells from mice treated with cortisone made the resistant C3H macrophages 100 times more susceptible in vitro."
10385,Increased in vitro susceptibility induced in this way by hydrocortisone was reversed by exposure to supernatant fluid removed from cultures of concanavalin A-treated spleen cells.
10386, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly lethal emerging disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV.
10387,New lethal animal models for SARS were needed to facilitate antiviral research.
10388,We adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice.
10389,It had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues.
10390,"Strain v2163 increased IL-1α, IL-6, MIP-1α, MCP-1, and RANTES in mice, and high IL-6 expression correlated with mortality."
10391,"The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation."
10392,In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication.
10393,"In v2163-infected mice, Ampligen™ was fully protective, stinging nettle lectin (UDA) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and EP128533 was inactive."
10394,"Ribavirin, UDA, and Ampligen™ decreased IL-6 expression."
10395,Strain v2163 provided a valuable model for anti-SARS research.
10396,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the SurePure Turbulator ultraviolet-C (UV-C, 254 nm wavelength) irradiation equipment on inactivation of different enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in commercially collected liquid animal plasma."
10397,"Specifically, Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Swine influenza virus (SIV) as enveloped viruses and Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Senecavirus A (SVA) as non-enveloped viruses, were inoculated in bovine or porcine plasma and subjected to different UV-C irradiation doses (0, 750, 1500, 3000, 6000 and 9000 J/L) using an UV-C device developed for opaque liquid working under turbulent flow."
10398,"The enveloped viruses tested were inactivated at < 3000 J/L of UV-C, being the dose needed to inactivate 4 log TCID(50) (4D) of 1612 J/L for PRV,1004 J/L for PRRSV, 1953 J/L for PEDV, 1639 J/L for SIV, 1641 J/L for CSFV and 1943 J/L for BVDV."
10399,"The non-enveloped viruses tended to have higher 4D values: 2161 J/L for PPV, 3223 J/L for SVA and 3708 J/L for SVDV."
10400,"Because the initial viral concentration was <4.0 Log for PCV-2, it was not possible to calculate the 4D value for this virus."
10401,"In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the SurePure Turbulator UV-C treatment system is capable of inactivating significant levels of swine viruses inoculated in commercially collected porcine or bovine plasma."
10402,It was concluded that irradiation with UV-C can provide an additional redundant biosafety feature in the manufacturing process of spray-dried animal plasma.
10403,"Compared to classical epidemiologic methods, genomics can be used to precisely monitor virus evolution and transmission in real time across large, diverse populations."
10404,Integration of pathogen genomics with data about host genetics and global transcriptional responses to infection allows for comprehensive studies of population-level responses to infection and provides novel methods for predicting clinical outcomes.
10405,"As genomic technologies become more accessible, these methods will redefine how emerging viruses are studied and outbreaks are contained."
10406,Here we review the existing and emerging genomic technologies that are enabling systems epidemiology and systems virology and making it possible to respond rapidly to emerging viruses such as Zika.
10407,: Small mammals such as bats and rodents have been increasingly recognized as reservoirs of novel potentially zoonotic pathogens.
10408,"However, few in vitro model systems to date allow assessment of zoonotic viruses in a relevant host context."
10409,The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a New World rodent species that has a long-standing history as an experimental animal model due to its unique susceptibility to human viruses.
10410,"Furthermore, wild cotton rats are associated with a large variety of known or potentially zoonotic pathogens."
10411,METHODS: A method for the isolation and culture of airway epithelial cell lines recently developed for bats was applied for the generation of rodent airway and renal epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat.
10412,Continuous cell lines were characterized for their epithelial properties as well as for their interferon competence.
10413,"Susceptibility to members of zoonotic Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Flaviviridae, in particular Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was tested."
10414,"Furthermore, novel arthropod-derived viruses belonging to the families Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae were tested."
10415,"RESULTS: We successfully established airway and kidney epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat, and characterized their epithelial properties."
10416,Cells were shown to be interferon-competent.
10417,"Viral infection assays showed high-titre viral replication of RVFV, VSV, WNV, and TBEV, as well as production of infectious virus particles."
10418,"No viral replication was observed for novel arthropod-derived members of the Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae families in these cell lines."
10419,"CONCLUSION: In the current study, we showed that newly established cell lines from the cotton rat can serve as host-specific in vitro models for viral infection experiments."
10420,"These cell lines may also serve as novel tools for virus isolation, as well as for the investigation of virus-host interactions in a relevant host species."
10421,"Experimental studies were conducted to evaluate two species of cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus and Sigmodon fulviventer, as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."
10422,"Blood and turbinate wash samples, and lung tissue were collected from each animal at different time points after SARS coronavirus (CoV) infection for determining the growth curve of virus, if any, by the standard infectivity assay in Vero E6 cells."
10423,"In addition, sections of the lung, liver, spleen, and kidney were taken and used for histology analysis."
10424,"All animals were observed daily for signs of illness, and in some experiments, animals were weighed on the day when they were sacrificed."
10425,"The results indicated that the cotton rat species, S. hispidus and S. fulviventer, were not a useful model for either SARS-CoV infection or disease."
10426,"This observation was supported by the absence of any signs of illness, the failure to consistently demonstrate virus in the blood and tissues, and the absent of any notable histopathology."
10427,"However, infected animals were capable of producing neuralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, suggesting the serocon-version did occur."
10428,Further studies are warranted to consider other animal species in efforts to find better animal models for the evaluation of SARS-CoV vaccines and antiviral drugs.
10429,Key Words: Cotton rats—SARS—Model animal.
10430," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that first emerged in Guangdong province, China, in November, 2002."
10431,A novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with SARS.
10432,"The detection of the virus in these patients, its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia, and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model fulfilled Koch's postulates for implicating this coronavirus as the causal agent of SARS."
10433,The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the virus's identification.
10434,"The rapid progress in the aetiology, the development of laboratory diagnostic tests, and the defining of routes of viral transmission were facilitated through a unique WHO-coordinated virtual network of laboratories, which shared information on a real-time basis through daily teleconferences."
10435,"Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS coronavirus is of animal origin, that its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region, and that live-animal markets in southern China may have provided the animal-human interphase that allowed this precursor virus to adapt to human-human transmission."
10436,These findings underscore the potential for the re-emergence of SARS and the need for laboratory tests for early diagnosis.
10437,"However, the low viral load in the respiratory tract makes early diagnosis of SARS a diagnostic challenge, although improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods continue to be made."
10438,Influenza A virus (IAV) causes seasonal epidemics of respiratory illness that can cause mild to severe illness and potentially death.
10439,"Antiviral drugs are an important countermeasure against IAV; however, drug resistance has developed, thus new therapeutic approaches are being sought."
10440,"Previously, we demonstrated the antiviral activity of a novel nuclear export inhibitor drug, verdinexor, to reduce influenza replication in vitro and pulmonary virus burden in mice."
10441,"In this study, in vivo efficacy of verdinexor was further evaluated in two animal models or influenza virus infection, mice and ferrets."
10442,"In mice, verdinexor was efficacious to limit virus shedding, reduce pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and moderate leukocyte infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space."
10443,"Similarly, verdinexor-treated ferrets had reduced lung pathology, virus burden, and inflammatory cytokine expression in the nasal wash exudate."
10444,"These findings support the anti-viral efficacy of verdinexor, and warrant its development as a novel antiviral therapeutic for influenza infection."
10445,The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) endomembrane is a central site for protein synthesis.
10446,"Perturbation of ER homeostasis can result in an accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER lumen, causing ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR)."
10447,"In humans, ER stress and UPR are closely associated with a vast number of diseases, including viral diseases."
10448,"In plants, two arms that govern the UPR signaling network have been described: one that contains two ER membrane–associated transcription factors (bZIP17 and bZIP28) and the other that encompasses a dual protein kinase (RNA-splicing factor IRE1) and its target RNA (bZIP60)."
10449,"Although early studies mainly focus on the essential roles of the UPR in abiotic stresses, the significance of UPR in plant diseases caused by virus infections has recently drawn much attention."
10450,"This chapter summarizes the latest scenario of ER stress and UPR in virus-infected plant cells, highlights the emerging roles of the IRE1 pathway in virus infections, and outlines exciting future directions to spark more research interest in the UPR field in plants."
10451, Temperature-sensitive mutants of the murine coronavirus JHM induced a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) in young rats.
10452,"Neurological symptoms were associated with marked lesions of primary demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), and developing after an incubation time of several weeks to months."
10453,Many rats survived this infection and recovered completely from this CNS disease.
10454,"Among 43 survivors of SDE, 9 rats developed a relapse 27–153 days after onset of the first attack."
10455,Neuropathological examination of these animals revealed areas of fresh demyelination together with old remyelinated lesions.
10456,Viral antigens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh lesions and in some cases infectious virus was re-isolated from rats revealing low antibody titers to JHM virus.
10457,"These results demonstrate that mutants of JHM virus can induce a relapsing demyelinating disease process, associated with a persistent infection, which possesses some similarities to chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis."
10458,"We investigated the antiviral activity of Arbidol, an antiviral chemical compound, against Coxsackie virus B5 (CVB(5)) in vitro and in vivo."
10459,"Arbidol not only prevented the cytopathic effect (CPE) of CVB(5), as demonstrated in an MTT colorimetric assay, when added during or after viral infection, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) from 2.66 to 6.62 μg/ml, but it also decreased the CVB(5)-RNA level in infected host cells, as shown in semi-quantitative RT-PCR."
10460,BALB/c mice were used as an animal model to test the Arbidol activity in vivo.
10461,Orally administered Arbidol at 50 mg/kg body weight/day (once a day) significantly reduced mean virus yields in the lungs and heart as well as mortality after infection for 6 days.
10462,Our results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo infection with CVB(5) can be effectively treated by Arbidol.
10463,": Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs) mediate their immunoregulatory and tissue repair functions by secreting paracrine factors, including extracellular vesicles (EVs)."
10464,"In several animal models of human diseases, MSC-EVs mimic the beneficial effects of MSCs."
10465,Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of acute respiratory illness resulting in significant mortality and morbidity.
10466,"Influenza viruses constantly evolve, thus generating drug-resistant strains and rendering current vaccines less effective against the newly generated strains."
10467,"Therefore, new therapies that can control virus replication and the inflammatory response of the host are needed."
10468,The objective of this study was to examine if MSC-EV treatment can attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in a preclinical model.
10469,METHODS: We isolated EVs from swine bone marrow-derived MSCs.
10470,Morphology of MSC-EVs was determined by electron microscopy and expression of mesenchymal markers was examined by flow cytometry.
10471,"Next, we examined the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs in vitro in lung epithelial cells and anti-viral and immunomodulatory properties in vivo in a pig model of influenza virus."
10472,RESULTS: MSC-EVs were isolated from MSC-conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation.
10473,"MSC-EVs were round-shaped and, similarly to MSCs, expressed mesenchymal markers and lacked the expression of swine leukocyte antigens I and II."
10474,Incubation of PKH-26-labeled EVs with lung epithelial cells revealed that MSC-EVs incorporated into the epithelial cells.
10475,"Next, we examined the anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties of MSC-EVs."
10476,"MSC-EVs inhibited the hemagglutination activity of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses at concentrations of 1.25–5 μg/ml."
10477,MSC-EVs inhibited influenza virus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells.
10478,The anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs was due to transfer of RNAs from EVs to epithelial cells since pre-incubation of MSC-EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs.
10479,"In a pig model of influenza virus, intratracheal administration of MSC-EVs 12 h after influenza virus infection significantly reduced virus shedding in the nasal swabs, influenza virus replication in the lungs, and virus-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of influenza-infected pigs."
10480,The histopathological findings revealed that MSC-EVs alleviated influenza virus-induced lung lesions in pigs.
10481,CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated in a relevant preclinical large animal model of influenza virus that MSC-EVs possessed anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties and that EVs may be used as cell-free therapy for influenza in humans.
10482,"DiNap [(E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(naphthalen-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one], an analog of a natural product (the chalcone flavokawain), was synthesized and characterized in this study."
10483,Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most challenging threat to the swine industry worldwide.
10484,"Currently, commercially available vaccines are ineffective for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs."
10485,"Therefore, a pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative control measure for PRRSV infection."
10486,"Hence, the present study evaluated the effects of DiNap on the replication of VR2332 (a prototype strain of type 2 PRRSV)."
10487,"Initially, in vitro antiviral assays against VR2332 were performed in MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs)."
10488,"Following this, a pilot study was conducted in a pig model to demonstrate the effects of DiNap following VR2332 infection."
10489,"DiNap inhibited VR2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and viral growth was completely suppressed at concentrations ≥0.06 mM, without significant cytotoxicity."
10490,"Consistent with these findings, in the pig study, DiNap also reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and enhanced the weight gain of pigs following VR2332 infection, as indicated by comparison of the DiNap-treated groups to the untreated control (NC) group."
10491,"In addition, DiNap-treated pigs had fewer gross and microscopic lesions in their lungs than NC pigs."
10492,"Notably, virus transmission was also delayed by approximately 1 week in uninfected contact pigs within the same group after treatment with DiNap."
10493,"Taken together, these results suggest that DiNap has potential anti-PRRSV activity and could be useful as a prophylactic or post-exposure treatment drug to control PRRSV infection in pigs."
10494,Influenza A viruses are highly infectious respiratory pathogens that can infect many species.
10495,Birds are the reservoir for all known influenza A subtypes; and novel influenza viruses can emerge from birds and infect mammalian species including humans.
10496,"Because swine are susceptible to infection with both avian and human influenza viruses, novel reassortant influenza viruses can be generated in this mammalian species by reassortment of influenza viral segments leading to the “mixing vessel” theory."
10497,"There is no direct evidence that the reassortment events culminating in the 1918, 1957 or 1968 pandemic influenza viruses originated from pigs."
10498,"Genetic reassortment among avian, human and/or swine influenza virus gene segments has occurred in pigs and some novel reassortant swine viruses have been transmitted to humans."
10499,"Notably, novel reassortant H2N3 influenza viruses isolated from the US pigs, most likely infected with avian influenza viruses through surface water collected in ponds for cleaning barns and watering animals, had a similar genetic make-up to early isolates (1957) of the H2N2 human pandemic."
10500,These novel H2N3 swine viruses were able to cause disease in swine and mice and were infectious and highly transmissible in swine and ferrets without prior adaptation.
10501,The preceding example shows that pigs could transmit novel viruses from an avian reservoir to other mammalian species.
10502,"Importantly, H2 viruses pose a substantial risk to humans because they have been absent from mammalian species since 1968 and people born after 1968 have little preexisting immunity to the H2 subtype."
10503,It is difficult to predict which virus will cause the next human pandemic and when that pandemic might begin.
10504,"Importantly, the establishment and spread of a reassorted mammalian-adapted virus from pigs to humans could happen anywhere in the world."
10505,"Therefore, both human and veterinary research needs to give more attention to potential cross-species transmission capacity of influenza A viruses."
10506,"The virus has caused much mortality and morbidity to humans, and still posed a serious threat to the global public health."
10507,The virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete.
10508,Novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics.
10509,"However, there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential."
10510,This study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences.
10511,The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%.
10512,"Even for the KNN models built on the contigs as short as 1kb, they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes, suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences."
10513,This work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies.
10514," In the past two decades, humans have faced many new viral infectious agents in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs)."
10515,Many factors contribute to the appearance of EIDs.
10516,"These factors are complex but can be classified into three different categories: virus factors, human factors, and ecological factors."
10517,The factors contributing to the cause of such viral infectious diseases will be systematically reviewed in this article.
10518,": T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions."
10519,"TIM-1 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions."
10520,"Here, we use a BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein to demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection."
10521,"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Infectious, GFP-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding either full length EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) or mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GPΔO/rVSV) was used to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo infection."
10522,GFP-expressing rVSV encoding its native glycoprotein G (G/rVSV) served as a control.
10523,TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon α/β receptor(-/-) mice were challenged with these viruses.
10524,"While G/rVSV caused profound morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPΔO/rVSV challenge."
10525,EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPΔO/rVSV in spleen of infected animals was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1.
10526,"However, infectious virus in serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load."
10527,"Consistent with higher virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more modestly affected."
10528,"To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus."
10529,Depletion of T cells did not alter the pathogenic consequences of virus infection.
10530,"CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this receptor in virus entry."
10531,"This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection."
10532,For 30 years it was thought the alphavirus 6K gene encoded a single 6 kDa protein.
10533,"However, through a bioinformatics search 10 years ago, it was discovered that there is a frameshifting event and two proteins, 6K and transframe (TF), are translated from the 6K gene."
10534,"Thus, many functions attributed to the 6K protein needed reevaluation to determine if they properly belong to 6K, TF, or both proteins."
10535,"In this mini-review, we reevaluate the past research on 6K and put those results in context where there are two proteins, 6K and TF, instead of one."
10536,"Additionally, we discuss the most cogent outstanding questions for 6K and TF research, including their collective importance in alphavirus budding and their potential importance in disease based on the latest virulence data."
10537,"Although bats are natural reservoir hosts for numerous zoonotic viruses, little is known about the long-term dynamics of the host immune response following infection and how these viruses are maintained in nature."
10538,The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a known reservoir host for Marburg virus (MARV).
10539,"Following infection of ERBs with MARV, virus-specific IgG antibodies are induced but rapidly wane and by 3 months post-infection the bats are seronegative."
10540,"To determine whether reinfection of ERBs plays a role in MARV maintenance, we challenge groups of ERBs that were “naturally” or experimentally infected with MARV 17–24 months prior."
10541,No bats in either group exhibit evidence of MARV replication or shedding and all bats develop virus-specific secondary immune responses.
10542,"This study demonstrates that infection of ERBs with MARV induces long-term protective immunity against reinfection and indicates that other factors, such as host population dynamics, drive MARV maintenance in nature."
10543,"Most human infectious diseases, especially recently emerging pathogens, originate from animals, and ongoing disease transmission from animals to people presents a significant global health burden."
10544,"Recognition of the epidemiologic circumstances involved in zoonotic spillover, amplification, and spread of diseases is essential for prioritizing surveillance and predicting future disease emergence risk."
10545,"We examine the animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses to date, and discover that viruses with high host plasticity (i.e."
10546,taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range) were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread.
10547,Viruses transmitted to humans during practices that facilitate mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity.
10548,Our findings suggest that animal-to-human spillover of new viruses that are capable of infecting diverse host species signal emerging disease events with higher pandemic potential in that these viruses are more likely to amplify by human-to-human transmission with spread on a global scale.
10549,The H9N2 avian influenza virus is a pandemic threat which has repeatedly caused infection in humans and shows enhanced replication and transmission in mice.
10550,"Previous reports showed that host factors, the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein, can block the replication of pathogens and affect their pathogenesis."
10551,"BALB/c mice are routine laboratory animals used in influenza virus research, but the effects of H9N2 influenza virus on tissue distribution and expression pattern of IFITM in these mice are unknown."
10552,"Here, we investigated the expression patterns and tissue distribution of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in BALB/c mice by infection with H9N2 AIV strains with only a PB2 residue 627 difference."
10553,The results showed that the expression patterns of ITITM1 and IFITM3 differ in various tissues of BALB/c mice at different time points after infection.
10554,"IFITM1 and IFITM3 showed cell- and tissue-specific distribution in the lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and brain."
10555,"Notably, the epithelial and neuronal cells all expressed the proteins of IFITM1 and IFITM3."
10556,Our results provide the first look at differences in IFITM1 and IFITM3 expression patterns in BALB/c mice infected by H9N2 influenza viruses.
10557,This will enhance research on the interaction between AIV and host and further will elucidate the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection based on the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein.
10558,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00430-014-0361-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
10559,: Interaction between immune system and Chandipura virus (CHPV) during different stages of its life cycle remain poorly understood.
10560,The exact route of virus entry into the blood and CNS invasion has not been clearly defined.
10561,The present study was undertaken to assess the population in PBMC that supports the growth of virus and to detect active virus replication in PBMC as well as its subsets.
10562,METHODS: PBMC subsets viz.
10563,": CD3(+), CD14(+), CD19(+), CD56(+)cells were separated and infected with CHPV."
10564,The infected cells were then assessed for transcription (N gene primer) and replication (NP gene primer) of CHPV by PCR.
10565,The supernatant collected from infected cells were titrated in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells to assess virus release.
10566,The cytokine and chemokine expression was quantified by flow cytometry.
10567,"RESULTS: Amplification of N and NP gene was detected in CD14(+) (monocyte) and CD19(+) (B cell), significant increase in virus titre was also observed in these subsets."
10568,"It was observed that, although the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated in CD14(+) cells as compared to CD19(+)cells, the differences were not significant."
10569,However the levels of TNFα and IL-8 were significantly elevated in CD14(+) cells than in CD19(+)cells.
10570,"The levels of chemokine (CXCL9, CCL5, CCL2, CXCL10) were significantly elevated in CHPV infected PBMC as compared to uninfected cells."
10571,CCL2 and CXCL9 were significantly increased in CHPV infected CD14(+)cells as compared to CD19(+) cells.
10572,CONCLUSION: CD14(+)and CD19(+)cells support active replication of CHPV.
10573,High viral load was detected in CD14(+) cells infected with CHPV hence it might be the primary target cells for active replication of CHPV.
10574,An elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines observed in CD14(+) cells may help in predicting the pathogenecity of CHPV and possible entry into the central nervous system.
10575,Editorial overview: Emerging viruses: interspecies transmission
10576,"Ferrets are widely used as a small animal model for a number of viral infections, including influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus."
10577,"To further analyze the microbiological status of ferrets, their fecal viral flora was studied using a metagenomics approach."
10578,"Novel viruses from the families Picorna-, Papilloma-, and Anelloviridae as well as known viruses from the families Astro-, Corona-, Parvo-, and Hepeviridae were identified in different ferret cohorts."
10579,"Ferret kobu- and hepatitis E virus were mainly present in human household ferrets, whereas coronaviruses were found both in household as well as farm ferrets."
10580,Our studies illuminate the viral diversity found in ferrets and provide tools to prescreen for newly identified viruses that potentially could influence disease outcome of experimental virus infections in ferrets.
10581, The high susceptibility of elderly to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) indicates how crucial it is to protect the elderly by various strategies.
10582,Aged BALB/c mice displayed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV and have been a valuable platform for evaluation of strategies against SARS-CoV infection.
10583,"In this study, we confirmed the validity of this model using various methods, and verified that equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')2 can prevent aged animals from SARS-CoV infection."
10584,"In a therapeutic setting, treatment with anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')2 decreased viral load more than several thousand folds in the lungs."
10585,"Thus, this antibody should be a potential candidate for treatment of elderly patients suffering from SARS."
10586, Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion.
10587,"Among these requirements are a port of entry into host cells, a means of replication for the virus, and a means by which infection damages host cells."
10588,"Damage to the host can result from multiple mechanisms including transformation, suppression of cellular metabolism, apoptosis, autoimmune responses directed against infected or uninfected tissues, or by molecular mimicry."
10589,"In the attempt to identify new associations between viral infection and disease, investigators should be mindful that variable host factors as well as viral infection may be required for pathogenesis."
10590,Efforts to associate specific viral infections with specific diseases may be obscured by final common pathways through which multiple agents damage host cells in similar ways.
10591, Several small animal models have been developed for the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication and pathogenesis.
10592,"Syrian golden hamsters are among the best small animal models, though little clinical illness and no mortality are observed after virus infection."
10593,Cyclophosphamide was used to immunosuppress hamsters leading to a prolonged disease course and higher mortality after SARS-CoV infection.
10594,"In addition, there was a significant weight loss, expanded tissue tropism, and increased viral pathology in the lung, heart, kidney, and nasal turbinate tissues."
10595,"Infection with recombinant SARS-CoV viruses bearing disruptions in the gene 7 coding region showed no significant change in replication kinetics, tissue tropism, morbidity, or mortality suggesting that the ORF7a (7a) and ORF7b (7b) proteins are not required for virus replication in immunosuppressed hamsters."
10596,"This modified hamster model may provide a useful tool for SARS-CoV pathogenesis studies, evaluation of antiviral therapy, and analysis of additional SARS-CoV mutants."
10597,"In the present study, the anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity of patchouli alcohol was studied in vitro, in vivo and in silico."
10598,The CC(50) of patchouli alcohol was above 20 µM.
10599,Patchouli alcohol could inhibit influenza virus with an IC(50) of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM.
10600,MTT assay showed that the inhibition by patchouli alcohol appears strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell.
10601,"In the influenza mouse model, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the viral infection at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day."
10602,"Flexible docking and molecular dynamic simulations indicated that patchouli alcohol was bound to the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus, with an interaction energy of –40.38 kcal mol(–1)."
10603,"The invariant key active-site residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 played important roles during the binding process."
10604,"Based on spatial and energetic criteria, patchouli alcohol interfered with the NA functions."
10605,"Results presented here suggest that patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus properties, and therefore is a potential source of anti-influenza agents for the pharmaceutical industry."
10606,Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) targets diverse microorganisms for phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis by binding specific surface glycans.
10607,"Although recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) trials have focused on reconstitution therapy, safety studies have identified no barriers to its use at higher levels."
10608,Ebola viruses cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers for which no treatment exists and that are feared as potential biothreat agents.
10609,We found that mice whose rhMBL serum concentrations were increased ≥7-fold above average human levels survived otherwise fatal Ebola virus infections and became immune to virus rechallenge.
10610,"Because Ebola glycoproteins potentially model other glycosylated viruses, rhMBL may offer a novel broad-spectrum antiviral approach."
10611,Virus infection often results in diverse outcomes.
10612,This variability of virus pathogenesis is not well understood.
10613,Here we revise theoretical arguments to further our understanding of factors controlling infection and its severity.
10614,"We propose that variability in these factors results in different clinical outcomes, which ultimately ensure virus reproduction."
10615," Segments of jejunum in 5 to 6 days old piglets were surgically ligated, inoculated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and 18 hours later the segments were fixed for histology or suspensions were prepared for plaque assay in swine testis (ST) cell cultures to determine the yield of virus."
10616,"When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes."
10617,"The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon."
10618,"When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-α or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-α2a, and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way."
10619,"However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV."
10620,There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum.
10621,"It was concluded that interferon would be ineffective as a therapeutic for TGEV, although it might be useful prophylactically."
10622," Viruses with pandemic potential including H1N1, H5N1, and H5N7 influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)/Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged in recent years."
10623,"SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods, sometimes up to months."
10624,"Factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include: strain variation, titre, surface type, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity, and the method used to determine the viability of the virus."
10625,"Environmental sampling has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus."
10626,"The importance of indirect contact transmission (involving contamination of inanimate surfaces) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes, principally direct contact transmission (independent of surface contamination), droplet, and airborne routes."
10627,"However, influenza virus and SARS-CoV may be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers."
10628,Emerging data suggest that MERS-CoV also shares these properties.
10629,"Once contaminated from the environment, hands can then initiate self-inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth."
10630,"Mathematical and animal models, and intervention studies suggest that contact transmission is the most important route in some scenarios."
10631,"Infection prevention and control implications include the need for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self-contamination and to protect against inoculation of mucosal surfaces and the respiratory tract, and enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings."
10632,Environmental Engineers and Scientists Have Important Roles to Play in Stemming Outbreaks and Pandemics Caused by Enveloped Viruses
10633,We studied the infectious effect of SARS-CoV virus on juvenile and adult Brandt’s Vole (Microtus brandtii) by nasal cavity spraying method (CCID(50) is 10(5.7)).
10634,SARS virus caused serious deaths in adults.
10635,"The death adults demonstrated hemorrhage from mouth, nasal cavity and intestine, hemorrhageious interstitial pneumonia and gore in liver, spleen and kidney."
10636,"The survival adults demonstrated local hemorrhagic spot in lung and emphysema, but the other organs showed no pathological abnormality."
10637,"SARS virus caused no deaths in juveniles, but locomotion of infected juveniles became slower."
10638,"In the early stage, there was local pneumonia in lung and SARS viruses were isolated from the pathological tissue."
10639,Only one control juvenile lived and the infected juvenile showed local pneumonia in lung.
10640,The results demonstrated that SARS-CoV infected Brandt’s vole seriously and adults were more susceptive to SARS-CoV than juveniles.
10641,The Brandt’s vole may be a potential animal model for SARS research.
10642," Three years after the pandemic, major advances have been made in our understanding of the innate and adaptive immune responses to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and those responses’ contribution to the immunopathology associated with this infection."
10643,Severe disease is characterized by early secretion of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines.
10644,This cytokine secretion persisted in patients with severe viral pneumonia and was directly associated with the degree of viral replication in the respiratory tract.
10645,"Cytokines play important roles in the antiviral defense, but persistent hypercytokinemia may cause inflammatory tissue damage and participate in the genesis of the respiratory failure observed in these patients."
10646,An absence of pre-existing protective antibodies was the rule for both mild and severe cases.
10647,A role for pathogenic immunocomplexes has been proposed for this disease.
10648,Defective T cell responses characterize severe cases of infection caused by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.
10649,"Immune alterations associated with accompanying conditions such as obesity, pregnancy or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may interfere with the normal development of the specific response to the virus."
10650,The role of host immunogenetic factors associated with disease severity is also discussed in this review.
10651,"In conclusion, currently available information suggests a complex immunological dysfunction/alteration that characterizes the severe cases of 2009 pandemic influenza."
10652,The potential benefits of prophylactic/therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing/correcting such dysfunction warrant investigation.
10653,Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) are rodent-borne hantaviruses that are the primary causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia.
10654,The development of well characterized animal models of HTNV and PUUV infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of HFRS vaccines and therapeutics.
10655,"In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret)."
10656,"Infection of hamsters with a ~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID(99)) of HTNV by the intramuscular and ~1 ID(99) of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney."
10657,"In contrast, infection of hamsters with ~2 ID(99) of PUUV by the intramuscular or ~1 ID(99) of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome."
10658,"Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected."
10659,"In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production."
10660,"Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets."
10661,This is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets.
10662,We describe the creative ways that virologists are leveraging experimental cross-species infections to study the interactions between viruses and hosts.
10663,"While viruses are usually well adapted to their hosts, cross-species approaches involve pairing viruses with species that they don’t naturally infect."
10664,"These cross-species infections pit viruses against animals, cell lines, or even single genes from foreign species."
10665,"We highlight examples where cross-species infections have yielded insights into mechanisms of host innate immunity, viral countermeasures, and the evolutionary interplay between viruses and hosts."
10666,Many viruses are capable of infecting the human respiratory tract to cause disease.
10667,"These viruses display various transmission patterns among humans; however, they all share the ability to transmit from person to person, and their human transmissibility is influenced by the environment in which pathogen and host meet."
10668,"This review aims to summarize recent and significant observations regarding the impact of environmental factors such as weather and climate, humidity, temperature, and airflow on the transmission of human respiratory viruses."
10669,"Where possible, knowledge gaps that require further scientific study will be identified."
10670,"Since March 2013, the emergence of an avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has raised concern in China."
10671,"Although most infections resulted in respiratory illness, some severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity."
10672,"To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified."
10673,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury."
10674,"In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model."
10675,"Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1)."
10676,"The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9) outbreaks."
10677,Background.
10678,Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses preferentially infect alveolar type II pneumocytes in human lung.
10679,"However, it is unknown whether this cellular tropism contributes to high viral virulence because the primary target cells of other influenza viruses have not been systematically studied."
10680,Methods.
10681,"We provide the first comparison of the replication, tropism, and cytokine induction of human, highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 and other animal influenza A viruses in primary human lung organ cultures."
10682,Results.
10683,"Subytpe H5N1 and human-adapted subtype H1N1 and H3N2 viruses replicated efficiently in the lung tissue, whereas classic swine and low-pathogenicity avian viruses propagated only poorly."
10684,"Nevertheless, all viruses examined were detected almost exclusively in type II pneumocytes, with a minor involvement of alveolar macrophages."
10685,"Infection with avian viruses that have a low and high pathogenicity provoked a pronounced induction of cytokines and chemokines, while human and pandemic H1N1-2009 viruses triggered only weak responses."
10686,Conclusions.
10687,These findings show that differences in the pathogenic potential of influenza A viruses in the human lung cannot be attributed to a distinct cellular tropism.
10688,"Rather, high or low viral pathogenicity is associated with a strain-specific capacity to productively replicate in type II pneumocytes and to cope with the induced cytokine response."
10689,"Due to novel, improved and high-throughput detection methods, there is a plethora of newly identified viruses within the genus Hantavirus."
10690,"Furthermore, reservoir host species are increasingly recognized besides representatives of the order Rodentia, now including members of the mammalian orders Soricomorpha/Eulipotyphla and Chiroptera."
10691,"Despite the great interest created by emerging zoonotic viruses, there is still a gross lack of in vitro models, which reflect the exclusive host adaptation of most zoonotic viruses."
10692,The usually narrow host range and genetic diversity of hantaviruses make them an exciting candidate for studying virus-host interactions on a cellular level.
10693,"To do so, well-characterized reservoir cell lines covering a wide range of bat, insectivore and rodent species are essential."
10694,Most currently available cell culture models display a heterologous virus-host relationship and are therefore only of limited value.
10695,"Here, we review the recently established approaches to generate reservoir-derived cell culture models for the in vitro study of virus-host interactions."
10696,These successfully used model systems almost exclusively originate from bats and bat-borne viruses other than hantaviruses.
10697,"Therefore we propose a parallel approach for research on rodent- and insectivore-borne hantaviruses, taking the generation of novel rodent and insectivore cell lines from wildlife species into account."
10698,"These cell lines would be also valuable for studies on further rodent-borne viruses, such as orthopox- and arenaviruses."
10699,Super-spreading occurs when a single patient infects a disproportionate number of contacts.
10700,"The 2015 MERS-CoV, 2003 SARS-CoV, and to a lesser extent 2014–15 Ebola virus outbreaks were driven by super-spreaders."
10701,"We summarize documented super-spreading in these outbreaks, explore contributing factors, and suggest studies to better understand super-spreading."
10702,"Human dengue viruses emerged from primate reservoirs, yet paradoxically dengue does not reach high titers in primate models."
10703,This presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts.
10704,"The dengue virus 2 (DENV2) - encoded protease cleaves human STING, reducing type I interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans."
10705,"We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species."
10706,The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species.
10707,Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded ‘RG’ renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage.
10708,"Dengue viruses may have evolved to increase viral titers in the dense and vast human population, while maintaining decreased titers and pathogenicity in the more rare animals that serve as their sustaining reservoir in nature."
10709,"Novel reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus cause human infections, while avian H7N2 and swine H1N1 virus mainly infect birds and pigs, respectively."
10710,There is no robust in vitro model for assessing the infectivity of emerging viruses in humans.
10711,"Based on a recently established method, we generated long-term expanding 3D human airway organoids which accommodate four types of airway epithelial cells: ciliated, goblet, club, and basal cells."
10712,We report differentiation conditions which increase ciliated cell numbers to a nearly physiological level with synchronously beating cilia readily discernible in every organoid.
10713,"In addition, the differentiation conditions induce elevated levels of serine proteases, which are essential for productive infection of human influenza viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses."
10714,We also established improved 2D monolayer culture conditions for the differentiated airway organoids.
10715,"To demonstrate the ability of differentiated airway organoids to identify human-infective virus, 3D and 2D differentiated airway organoids are applied to evaluate two pairs of viruses with known distinct infectivity in humans, H7N9/Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus an H1N1 strain isolated from swine (H1N1sw)."
10716,The human-infective H7N9/Ah virus replicated more robustly than the poorly human-infective H7N2 virus; the highly human-infective H1N1pdm virus replicated to a higher titer than the counterpart H1N1sw.
10717,"Collectively, we developed differentiated human airway organoids which can morphologically and functionally simulate human airway epithelium."
10718,These differentiated airway organoids can be applied for rapid assessment of the infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses to human.
10719,The advent of unbiased metagenomic virus discovery has revolutionized studies of virus biodiversity and evolution.
10720,"Despite this, our knowledge of the virosphere, including in mammalian species, remains limited."
10721,We used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to identify RNA viruses in European field voles and rabbits.
10722,"Accordingly, we identified a number of novel RNA viruses including astrovirus, rotavirus A, picorna-like virus and a narmovirus (paramyxovirus)."
10723,"In addition, we identified a sobemovirus and a novel luteovirus that likely originated from the rabbit diet."
10724,These newly discovered viruses were often divergent from those previously described.
10725,The novel astrovirus was most closely related to a virus sampled from the rodent-eating European roller bird (Coracias garrulous).
10726,"PCR screening revealed that the novel narmovirus in the UK field vole had a prevalence of approximately 4%, and shared common ancestry with other rodent narmoviruses sampled globally."
10727,"Two novel rotavirus A sequences were detected in a UK field vole and a French rabbit, the latter with a prevalence of 5%."
10728,"Finally, a highly divergent picorna-like virus found in the gut of the French rabbit virus was only ~35% similar to an arilivirus at the amino acid level, suggesting the presence of a novel viral genus within the Picornaviridae."
10729,  This chapter discusses the ways in which viral replication damages tissues and organs and the ways in which the body's own responses may cause damage.
10730,"It presents examples illustrating the pathogenesis of four basic kinds of acute viral infection: respiratory, intestinal, generalized, and neurological."
10731,"As the immune system plays a key role in protection against infections, viral damage to its components can exacerbate the severity of disease or predispose to superinfection with other viral or nonviral agents."
10732,Both specific acquired immunodeficiency and generalized immunosuppression can occur in viral infections.
10733,The immune response to viral infection may itself frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease.
10734,Inflammation with accompanying cellular infiltration is a regular feature of viral infection.
10735,"Such common signs as erythema, edema, and enlargement of lymph nodes have an immunological basis."
10736,There are viral diseases in which the cardinal manifestations are caused by the body's immune response.
10737,"Immunopathological (hypersensitivity) reactions are traditionally classified into types 1, 2, 3, and 4."
10738,"For most viral infections, it is not known whether immunopathological effects make a significant contribution to disease and if so then as to which of the four classical hypersensitivity reactions is implicated."
10739,It is instructive to speculate about the possible involvement of different kinds of hypersensitivity reactions in viral diseases.
10740,"While RNA viruses thrive with massive structural and functional diversity, their genomes size variation is particularly low, ranging only from ~2-to-33 kb."
10741,"Here, I present the characterization of RNA sequences corresponding to the first virus associated with Aplysia californica ."
10742,Genome structure and domain architecture suggest that the identified virus is a novel member of Nidovirales .
10743,"The proposed aplysia californica nido-like virus (AcNV), with a genome sequence of ca.35,906 nt, represents the longest ever recorded RNA virus yet."
10744,"Phylogenetic insights indicate that AcNV clusters in a major phylloclade of unclassified invertebrate nidoviruses, Roniviridae , and Mesoniviridae ."
10745,Basal branching in this emerging cluster could indicate that AcNV is a member of a novel divergent clade within Nidovirales .
10746,"Further, virus RNA detection in multiple independent studies suggests that AcNV is neurotropic with a broad cell/tissue/organ tropism, supported by AcNV occurrence in diverse organs, including the first detection of a Nidovirales in single specific neurons."
10747,Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus causes an acute vesicular disease of domesticated and wild ruminants and pigs.
10748,"Identifying sources of FMD outbreaks is often confounded by incomplete epidemiological evidence and the numerous routes by which virus can spread (movements of infected animals or their products, contaminated persons, objects, and aerosols)."
10749,"Here, we show that the outbreaks of FMD in the United Kingdom in August 2007 were caused by a derivative of FMDV O(1) BFS 1860, a virus strain handled at two FMD laboratories located on a single site at Pirbright in Surrey."
10750,"Genetic analysis of complete viral genomes generated in real-time reveals a probable chain of transmission events, predicting undisclosed infected premises, and connecting the second cluster of outbreaks in September to those in August."
10751,Complete genome sequence analysis of FMD viruses conducted in real-time have identified the initial and intermediate sources of these outbreaks and demonstrate the value of such techniques in providing information useful to contemporary disease control programmes.
10752,The high pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses in sporadic infections of humans has raised concerns for its potential to acquire the ability to transmit between humans and emerge as a highly pathogenic pandemic virus.
10753,"Because avian and human influenza viruses differ in their specificity for recognition of their host cell receptors, receptor specificity represents one barrier for efficient transmission of avian viruses in human hosts."
10754,"Over the last century, each influenza virus pandemic has coincided with the emergence of virus with an immunologically distinct hemagglutinin exhibiting a ‘human-type’ receptor specificity, distinct from that of viruses with the same hemagglutinin circulating in zoonotic species."
10755,"Recent studies suggest that it is possible for H5N1 to acquire human type receptor specificity, but this has not occurred in nature."
10756,"This review covers what is known about the molecular basis for the switch between avian and human-type receptor specificity for influenza viruses that have successfully adapted to man, the potential for H5N1 to evolve to human-type receptor specificity and its relevance to pandemic risk."
10757,Influenza A virus infects a wide range of species including both birds and mammals (including humans).
10758,One of the key routes by which the virus can infect populations of animals is by aerosol transmission.
10759,This study explored the relationship between number of infected pigs and the probability of detecting influenza virus RNA in bioaerosols through the course of an acute infection.
10760,Bioaerosols were collected using a cyclonic collector in two groups of 7 week-old pigs that were experimentally infected by exposure with a contact infected pig (seeder pig).
10761,"After contact exposure, individual pig nasal swab samples were collected daily and air samples were collected three times per day for 8 days."
10762,All samples were tested for influenza by real-time reverse transcriptase (RRT)-PCR targeting the influenza virus matrix gene.
10763,All pigs' nasal swabs became influenza virus RRT-PCR positive upon exposure to the infected seeder pig.
10764,Airborne influenza was detected in 28/43 (65%) air samples.
10765,The temporal dynamics of influenza virus detection in air samples was in close agreement with the nasal shedding pattern in the infected pigs.
10766,First detection of positive bioaerosols happened at 1 day post contact (DPC).
10767,"Positive bioaerosols were consistently detected between 3 and 6 DPC, a time when most pigs were also shedding virus in nasal secretions."
10768,"Overall, the odds of detecting a positive air sample increased 2.2 times for every additional nasal swab positive pig in the group."
10769,"In summary, there was a strong relationship between the number of pigs shedding influenza virus in nasal secretions and the generation of bioaerosols during the course of an acute infection."
10770,"In the United States, outbreaks of avian influenza H5 and H7 virus infections in poultry have raised concern about the risk for infections in humans."
10771,"We reviewed the data collected during 2014–2017 and found no human infections among 4,555 exposed responders who were wearing protection."
10772,"As exemplified by coronaviruses and influenza viruses, bats and birds are natural reservoirs for providing viral genes during evolution of new virus species and viruses for interspecies transmission."
10773,"These warm-blooded vertebrates display high species biodiversity, roosting and migratory behavior, and a unique adaptive immune system, which are favorable characteristics for asymptomatic shedding, dissemination, and mixing of different viruses for the generation of novel mutant, recombinant, or reassortant RNA viruses."
10774,The increased intrusion of humans into wildlife habitats and overcrowding of different wildlife species in wet markets and farms have also facilitated the interspecies transmission between different animal species.
10775, The interaction of bacteria and virus has been well demonstrated in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease in swine.
10776,The interaction between porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSv) and Haemophilus parasuis has not been studied.
10777,We initiated studies to evaluate a possible effect of the PRRSv on the pathogenesis of polyserositis caused by H. parasuis.
10778,A group of 30 three week old piglets were distributed in 4 groups.
10779,Group I (10 pigs) was inoculated with PRRSv and H. parasuis.
10780,Group II (10 pigs) was inoculated with H. parasuis alone.
10781,Group III (5 pigs) was inoculated with virus alone and group IV (5 pigs) was inoculated with culture media.
10782,Lesions consisted of a severe fibrinous polyserositis affecting 7 of 10 animals in group II and a mild fibrinous pleuritis in 1 of 10 animals of group I.
10783,Three of ten animals dually infected with the two agents died during the course of the study.
10784,These animals had pulmonary congestion and focal lung hemorrhages.
10785,No other animals died from other groups.
10786,Group III and IV had no macroscopic lesions.
10787,Microscopically group III had interstitial pneumonia.
10788,Immunomodulating virus effect may explain the differences in terms of lesions severity between groups I and II.
10789,Septic shock was suspected as cause of sudden death.
10790,Background.
10791,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) remains a significant public health concern after the epidemic in 2003.
10792,Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that neutralize SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV) could provide protection for exposed individuals.
10793,Methods.
10794,Transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes were immunized with the recombinant major surface (S) glycoprotein ectodomain of SARS-CoV.
10795,Epitopes of 2 neutralizing MAbs derived from these mice were mapped and evaluated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection.
10796,Results.
10797,Both MAbs bound to S glycoprotein expressed on transfected cells but differed in their ability to block binding of S glycoprotein to Vero E6 cells.
10798,"Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed 2 antibody-binding epitopes: one MAb (201) bound within the receptor-binding domain at aa 490–510, and the other MAb (68) bound externally to the domain at aa 130–150."
10799,"Mice that received 40 mg/kg of either MAb prior to challenge with SARS-CoV were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs, and doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg offered significant protection."
10800,Conclusions.
10801,Two neutralizing epitopes were defined for MAbs to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein.
10802,Antibodies to both epitopes protected mice against SARS-CoV challenge.
10803,"Clinical trials are planned to test MAb 201, a fully human MAb specific for the epitope within the receptor-binding region."
10804,: Influenza virus infections are a major public health concern worldwide.
10805,Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins.
10806,"However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals."
10807,Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity.
10808,"However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application."
10809,"METHODS: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs’ anti-influenza applicability."
10810,"RESULTS: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively."
10811,The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines.
10812,"As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively."
10813,"In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs."
10814,"In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%."
10815,CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the potential of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for host-targeted treatment against influenza.
10816," Host responses can contribute to the severity of viral infection, through the failure of innate antiviral mechanisms to recognize and restrict the pathogen, the development of intense systemic inflammation leading to circulatory failure or through tissue injury resulting from overly exuberant cell-mediated immune responses."
10817,High-throughput genomics methods are now being used to identify the biochemical pathways underlying ineffective or damaging host responses in a number of acute and chronic viral infections.
10818,"This article reviews recent gene expression studies of 1918 H1N1 influenza and Ebola hemorrhagic fever in cell culture and animal models, focusing on how genomics experiments can be used to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that permit those viruses to cause rapidly overwhelming infection."
10819,Particular attention is paid to how evasion of type I IFN responses in infected cells might contribute to over-activation of inflammatory responses.
10820,"Reviewing recent research and describing how future studies might be tailored to understand the relationship between the infected cell and its environment, this article discusses how the rapidly growing field of high-throughput genomics can contribute to a more complete understanding of severe, acute viral infections and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention."
10821," Antivenoms are preparations of intact or fragmented (F(ab′)2 or Fab) immunoglobulin G (IgG) used in human medicine to treat the severe envenomings resulting from the bites and stings of various animals, such as snakes, spiders, scorpions, or marine animals, or from the contact with poisonous plants."
10822,"They are obtained by fractionating plasma collected from immunized horses or, less frequently, sheep."
10823,"Manufacturing processes usually include pepsin digestion at acid pH, papain digestion, ammonium sulphate precipitation, caprylic acid precipitation, heat coagulation and/or chromatography."
10824,"Most production processes do not have deliberately introduced viral inactivation or removal treatments, but antivenoms have never been found to transmit viruses to humans."
10825,"Nevertheless, the recent examples of zoonotic diseases highlight the need to perform a careful assessment of the viral safety of antivenoms."
10826,This paper reviews the characteristics of equine viruses of antivenoms and discusses the potential of some manufacturing steps to avoid risks of viral contamination.
10827,"Analysis of production parameters indicate that acid pH treatments and caprylic acid precipitations, which have been validated for the manufacture of some human IgG products, appear to provide the best potential for viral inactivation of antivenoms."
10828,"As many manufacturers of antivenoms located in developing countries lack the resources to conduct formal viral validation studies, it is hoped that this review will help in the scientific understanding of the viral safety factors of antivenoms, in the controlled implementation of the manufacturing steps with expected impact on viral safety, and in the overall reinforcement of good manufacturing practices of these essential therapeutic products."
10829," Two species of primates, Owl and African green monkeys, were inoculated intracerebrally with either the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus JHM or the putative multiple sclerosis brain coronavirus isolate SD."
10830,These viruses caused an acute to subacute panencephalitis and/or demyelination in the infected animals.
10831,The course of pathogenesis and sites of detected viral RNA and antigen was dependent both on animal species and virus strain but the results clearly showed that these viruses replicated and disseminated in the central nervous system (CNS) of these primates.
10832,This study suggests that human CNS may be susceptible to coronavirus infection.
10833,Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) induces an acute encephalomyelitis associated with demyelination.
10834,"To examine the anti-viral and/or regulatory role of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling in the cell that synthesizes and maintains the myelin sheath, we analyzed JHMV pathogenesis in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative IFN-γ receptor on oligodendroglia."
10835,Defective IFN-γ signaling was associated with enhanced oligodendroglial tropism and delayed virus clearance.
10836,"However, the CNS inflammatory cell composition and CD8+ T-cell effector functions were similar between transgenic and wild-type mice, supporting unimpaired peripheral and CNS immune responses in transgenic mice."
10837,"Surprisingly, increased viral load in oligodendroglia did not affect the extent of myelin loss, the frequency of oligodendroglial apoptosis, or CNS recruitment of macrophages."
10838,These data demonstrate that IFN-γ receptor signaling is critical for the control of JHMV replication in oligodendroglia.
10839,"In addition, the absence of a correlation between increased oligodendroglial infection and the extent of demyelination suggests a complex pathobiology of myelin loss in which infection of oligodendroglia is required but not sufficient."
10840, Mouse hepatitis virus induces a biphasic disease in BALB/c mice that consists of an acute retinitis followed by progression to a chronic retinal degeneration with autoimmune reactivity.
10841,Retinal degeneration resistant CD-1 mice do not develop the late phase.
10842,What host factors contribute to the distinct responses to the virus are unknown.
10843,"Herein, we show that IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ act in concert as part of the innate immune response to the retinal infection."
10844,"At day 2, high serum levels of IFN-γ, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were detected in BALB/c mice."
10845,"Moreover, elevated levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 gene expression were detected in retinal tissue."
10846,"Although IFN-γ and the chemokines were detected in CD-1 mice, they were at significantly lower levels compared to BALB/c mice."
10847,These augmented innate responses observed correlated with the development of autoimmune reactivity and retinal degeneration and thus may contribute to the pathogenic processes.
10848, Emerging infection is usually an important public health concern.
10849,"Within the past decade, there are many new emerging infectious diseases."
10850,An important concern is on the pandemic of those new emerging infections.
10851,"The cross species infection from animal to human, zoonosis, is usually problematic and hard to manage."
10852,The well-known situations are on new emerging atypical influenza infections.
10853,"In this brief article, the author discuss on three important cross species emerging influenza, H5N1 bird flu, H1N1 swine flu and H7N9 bird flu."
10854,The basic details of those new influenzas genetic aberration and the concept for surveillance and prediction of new mutation that result in the new cross species emerging zoonosis are also mentioned in this article.
10855,Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is frequently used in oncology and cardiology to evaluate disease progression and/or treatment efficacy.
10856,Such technology allows for real-time evaluation of disease progression and when applied to studying infectious diseases may provide insight into pathogenesis.
10857,Insertion of a SPECT-compatible reporter gene into a virus may provide insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and viral tropism.
10858,"The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), a SPECT and positron emission tomography reporter gene, was inserted into Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in afflicted humans to obtain a quantifiable and sensitive marker for viral replication to further MERS-CoV animal model development."
10859,"The recombinant virus was evaluated for fitness, stability, and reporter gene functionality."
10860,"The recombinant and parental viruses demonstrated equal fitness in terms of peak titer and replication kinetics, were stable for up to six in vitro passages, and were functional."
10861,"Further in vivo evaluation indicated variable stability, but resolution limits hampered in vivo functional evaluation."
10862,These data support the further development of hNIS for monitoring infection in animal models of viral disease.
10863,IMPORTANCE Advanced medical imaging such as single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) enhances fields such as oncology and cardiology.
10864,"Application of SPECT/CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography to infectious disease may enhance pathogenesis studies and provide alternate biomarkers of disease progression."
10865,The experiments described in this article focus on insertion of a SPECT/CT-compatible reporter gene into MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a functional SPECT/CT reporter gene can be inserted into a virus.
10866,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
10867,Bats are speculated to be reservoirs of several emerging viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) that cause serious disease in humans and agricultural animals.
10868,"These include CoVs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and severe acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)."
10869,Bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease.
10870,These observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs.
10871,"In this review, we follow the CoV outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats."
10872,We review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor CoVs without severe disease.
10873,We speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and factors that enable these viruses to “jump” from bats to other mammals.
10874,We hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations.
10875,Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a prevalent heart muscle disease characterized by impaired contractility and dilation of the ventricles.
10876,"Recent clinical research suggests that cardiotropic viruses are important environmental pathogenic factors in human DCM, which may therefore be considered as a chronic viral cardiomyopathy."
10877,All virus-positive DCM patients thus come into the focus of virological research and should be considered for antiviral strategies.
10878,"Interferon-β therapy has been shown to mediate virus elimination in patients with adenovirus or coxsackievirus persistence.We discuss here several possible new molecular targets for patients infected with cardiotropic viruses in (1) the cellular virus uptake system, (2) virus-induced cellular signaling pathways, and (3) interactions between virus-encoded proteins with important cellular target proteins."
10879,The potential of these approaches in the setting of a chronic viral infection is significantly different from that in an acute viral infection.
10880,Specific problems encountered in a chronic situation and possible solutions are discussed.
10881,"CHAPTER 2 Cultivation, Assay, and Analysis of Viruses"
10882, Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus which infects chickens (Gallus gallus) of all ages and causes significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide.
10883,The present study aims to analyze the miRNAs related to pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs.
10884,"It was found that four miRNAs (miR-1454, miR-3538, miR-146a-5p and miR-215-5p) were related to the infection of virulent nephropathogenic IBV with transcript per million (TPM) > 500 and more than a 2-fold alteration."
10885,In vitro study results showed that the alterations of these four miRNAs were consistent with in vivo data.
10886,"In vitro, we found that high levels of miR-146a-5p could enhance the replication of IBV at the early stage of infection, and its down regulated level could slow down the replication of IBV."
10887,"Finally, high levels of exogenous miR-146a-5p in HD11 cells led to down regulation of IL-1 receptor associated kinase-2 (IRAK2) and Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (TNFRSF18) genes."
10888,Luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-146a-5p could bind to the 3′-UTRs of IRAK2 and TNFRSF18.
10889,"This is the first study demonstrating that IBV induced miR-146a-5p is related to virus pathogenesis by down regulating IRAK2 and TNFRSF18, which may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of IBV infections."
10890,"Ten years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been identified as the cause of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travelers from this region."
10891,"Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus."
10892,"It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection."
10893,"However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients."
10894,"Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not."
10895,"Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV “a threat to the entire world.” This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered."
10896,"Due to their inability to generate a complete immune response, mice knockout for type I interferon (IFN) receptors (Ifnar(–/–)) are more susceptible to viral infections, and are thus commonly used for pathogenesis studies."
10897,"This mouse model has been used to study many diseases caused by highly pathogenic viruses from many families, including the Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Henipaviridae, and Togaviridae."
10898,"In this review, we summarize the findings from these animal studies, and discuss the pros and cons of using this model versus other known methods for studying pathogenesis in animals."
10899,"Bats are implicated as the natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic viruses that can infect other animal species, including man."
10900,"Here, we investigate the potential for two recently discovered bat rubulaviruses, Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2), isolated from urine collected under urban bat (Eidolon helvum) roosts in Ghana, West Africa, to infect small laboratory animals."
10901,AchPV1 and AchPV2 are classified in the family Paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses (i.e.
10902,"Sosuga, Menangle and Tioman viruses)."
10903,"To assess the susceptibility of AchPV1 and AchPV2 in animals, infection studies were conducted in ferrets, guinea pigs and mice."
10904,"Seroconversion, immunohistological evidence of infection, and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs, but not in mice."
10905,Infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets.
10906,"Viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs, however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues."
10907,The results from this study indicate Achimota viruses (AchPVs) are able to cross the species barrier.
10908,"Consequently, vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present."
10909,"Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface, an unusually large RNA genome, and a unique replication strategy."
10910,Coronaviruses cause a variety of diseases in mammals and birds ranging from enteritis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease chickens to potentially lethal human respiratory infections.
10911,"Here we provide a brief introduction to coronaviruses discussing their replication and pathogenicity, and current prevention and treatment strategies."
10912,We will also discuss the outbreaks of the highly pathogenic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the recently identified Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
10913, Inoculation of mice with most neurotropic strains of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus results in an immune response-mediated demyelinating disease that serves as an excellent animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis.
10914,Recent work has shown that either virus-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are able to mediate demyelination and also that the antibody response is crucial for clearing infectious virus.
10915,"Another exciting advance is the development of recombinant coronaviruses, which, for the first time, will allow genetic manipulation of the entire viral genome."
10916,"RNA viruses, with their high potential for mutation and epidemic spread, are the most common class of pathogens found as new causes of human illness."
10917,"Despite great advances made in diagnostic technology since the 1950s, the annual rate at which novel virulent viruses have been found has remained at 2–3."
10918,Most emerging viruses are zoonoses; they have jumped from mammal or bird hosts to humans.
10919,"An analysis of virus discovery indicates that the small number of novel viruses discovered annually is an artifact of inadequate surveillance in tropical and subtropical countries, where even established endemic pathogens are often misdiagnosed."
10920,Many of the emerging viruses of the future are already infecting humans but remain to be uncovered by a strategy of disease surveillance in selected populations.
10921, Involvement of viruses in human neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying pathologic mechanisms remain generally unclear.
10922,"Human respiratory coronaviruses (HCoV) can infect neural cells, persist in human brain, and activate myelin-reactive T cells."
10923,"As a means of understanding the human infection, we characterized in vivo the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of HCoV-OC43 through the development of an experimental animal model."
10924,"Virus inoculation of 21-day postnatal C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice led to a generalized infection of the whole CNS, demonstrating HCoV-OC43 neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence."
10925,"This acute infection targeted neurons, which underwent vacuolation and degeneration while infected regions presented strong microglial reactivity and inflammatory reactions."
10926,Damage to the CNS was not immunologically mediated and microglial reactivity was instead a consequence of direct virus-mediated neuronal injury.
10927,"Although this acute encephalitis appears generally similar to that induced by murine coronaviruses, an important difference rests in the prominent spongiform-like degeneration that could trigger neuropathology in surviving animals."
10928, The porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is a multiphosphorylated protein.It has been proved that the phosphorylation of N protein could regulate the growth ability of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells.
10929,"However, further investigation is needed to determine whether phosphorylation of the N protein could affect PRRSV virulence in piglets."
10930,"In this study, we confirmed that the mutations could impair PRRSV replication ability in porcine primary macrophages (PAMs) as they did in Marc-145 cells."
10931,The animal experiments suggested that the pathogenicity of the mutated virus (A105-120) was significantly reduced compared with parent strain (XH-GD).
10932,Our results suggested that the phosphorylation of the N protein contributes to virus replication and virulence.
10933,This study is the first to identify a specific modification involved in PRRSV pathogenicity.
10934,Mutation of PTMs sites is also a novel way to attenuate PRRSV virulence.
10935,The mutations could be a marker in a vaccine.
10936,"In conclusion, our study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV pathogenicity."
10937,SARS coronavirus infection: pathology and pathogenesis of an emerging virus disease
10938," A wide range of microorganisms can replicate in macrophages, and cell entry of these pathogens via non-neutralising IgG antibody complexes can result in increased intracellular infection through idiosyncratic Fcγ-receptor signalling."
10939,The activation of Fcγ receptors usually leads to phagocytosis.
10940,"Paradoxically, the ligation of monocyte or macrophage Fcγ receptors by IgG immune complexes, rather than aiding host defences, can suppress innate immunity, increase production of interleukin 10, and bias T-helper-1 (Th1) responses to Th2 responses, leading to increased infectious output by infected cells."
10941,This intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection modulates the severity of diseases as disparate as dengue haemorrhagic fever and leishmaniasis.
10942,"Intrinsic ADE is distinct from extrinsic ADE, whereby complexes of infectious agents with non-neutralising antibodies lead to an increased number of infected cells."
10943,"Intrinsic ADE might be involved in many protozoan, bacterial, and viral infections."
10944,We review insights into intracellular mechanisms and implications of enhanced pathogenesis after ligation of macrophage Fcγ receptors by infectious immune complexes.
10945,"Norovirus (NoV) was first reported as causative agent of gastroenteritis in 1972, when students and staff of an elementary school located in Norwalk, Ohio, USA, presented vomitus and diarrhoea."
10946,"After this, a number of studies definitively associated the NoV infection with outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis."
10947,"Nowadays, NoV is considered the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks and severe childhood diarrhoea worldwide, including water- and food-borne outbreaks."
10948,"In animals, NoV infections have been reported in swine, bovine, ovine, canine, feline, and murine."
10949,The pathogenic role of NoV infection and its impact in animal health are not completely clear.
10950,Most of the epidemiological studies detected NoV in asymptomatic animal hosts worldwide.
10951,"However, there are studies that associated the NoV infection with disease, especially enteritis, in swine, bovine, canine, and feline."
10952,"This chapter presents the NoV properties and describes the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and available techniques for diagnosis of the virus infection."
10953,"Additionally, the NoV infection management and prophylaxis measures for livestock animal species are approached."
10954,"CHAPTER 13 The Cell Surface, Virus Modification, and Virus Transformation"
10955,Small RNA viruses have evolved many mechanisms to increase the capacity of their short genomes.
10956,"Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel open reading frame (ORF4) encoded by the murine norovirus (MNV) subgenomic RNA, in an alternative reading frame overlapping the VP1 coding region."
10957,ORF4 is translated during virus infection and the resultant protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria.
10958,Using reverse genetics we demonstrated that expression of ORF4 is not required for virus replication in tissue culture but its loss results in a fitness cost since viruses lacking the ability to express ORF4 restore expression upon repeated passage in tissue culture.
10959,"Functional analysis indicated that the protein produced from ORF4 antagonizes the innate immune response to infection by delaying the upregulation of a number of cellular genes activated by the innate pathway, including IFN-Beta."
10960,Apoptosis in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was also increased during virus infection in the absence of ORF4 expression.
10961,In vivo analysis of the WT and mutant virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 demonstrated an important role for ORF4 expression in infection and virulence.
10962,STAT1-/- mice infected with a virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 showed a delay in the onset of clinical signs when compared to mice infected with WT virus.
10963,Quantitative PCR and histopathological analysis of samples from these infected mice demonstrated that infection with a virus not expressing ORF4 results in a delayed infection in this system.
10964,"In light of these findings we propose the name virulence factor 1, VF1 for this protein."
10965,The identification of VF1 represents the first characterization of an alternative open reading frame protein for the calicivirus family.
10966,The immune regulatory function of the MNV VF1 protein provide important perspectives for future research into norovirus biology and pathogenesis.
10967,"Infected macrophages in spinal cords of mice persistently infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) undergo apoptosis, resulting in restricted virus yields, as do infected macrophages in culture."
10968,Apoptosis of murine macrophages in culture occurs via the intrinsic pathway later in infection (>10 h postinfection [p.i.])
10969,"after maximal virus titers (150 to 200 PFU/cell) have been reached, with loss of most infectious virus (<5 PFU/cell) by 20 to 24 h p.i."
10970,"Here, we show that BeAn virus RNA replication, translation, polyprotein processing into final protein products, and assembly of protomers and pentamers in infected M1-D macrophages did not differ from those processes in TMEV-infected BHK-21 cells, which undergo necroptosis."
10971,"However, the initial difference from BHK-21 cell infection was seen at 10 to 12 h p.i., where virions from the 160S peak in sucrose gradients had incompletely processed VP0 (compared to that in infected BHK-21 cells)."
10972,"Thereafter, there was a gradual loss of the 160S virion peak in sucrose gradients, with replacement by a 216S peak that was observed to contain pentamers among lipid debris in negatively stained grids by electron microscopy."
10973,"After infection or incubation of purified virions with activated caspase-3 in vitro, 13- and 17-kDa capsid peptide fragments were observed and were predicted by algorithms to contain cleavage sites within proteins by cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases."
10974,These findings suggest that caspase cleavage of sites in exposed capsid loops of assembled virions occurs contemporaneously with the onset and progression of apoptosis later in the infection.
10975,"IMPORTANCE Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection in mice results in establishment of virus persistence in the central nervous system and chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, providing an experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis."
10976,Virus persistence takes place primarily in macrophages recruited into the spinal cord that undergo apoptosis and in turn may facilitate viral spread via infected apoptotic blebs.
10977,Infection of murine macrophages in culture results in restricted virus yields late in infection.
10978,"Here it is shown that the early steps of the virus life cycle in infected macrophages in vitro do not differ from these processes in TMEV-infected BHK-21 cells, which undergo necroptosis."
10979,"However, the findings late in infection suggest that caspases cleave sites in exposed capsid loops and possibly internal sites of assembled virions occurring contemporaneously with onset and progression of apoptosis."
10980,"Mechanistically, this would explain the dramatic loss in virus yields during TMEV-induced apoptosis and attenuate the virus, enabling persistence."
10981,The Daniels strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis produces a chronic disease which is an animal model for human demyelinating disorders.
10982,"Previously, we selected a neutralization-resistant virus variant producing an altered and diminished central nervous system disease in immunocompetent mice which was evident during the later stage of infection (after 4 weeks) (A. Zurbriggen and R. S. Fujinami, J. Virol."
10983,"63:1505-1513, 1989)."
10984,"The exact epitope determining neurovirulence was precisely mapped to a capsid protein, VP-1, and represents a neutralizing region (A. Zurbriggen, J. M. Hogle, and R. S. Fujinami, J. Exp."
10985,Med.
10986,"170:2037-2049, 1989)."
10987,"Here, we present experiments with immunoincompetent animals to determine viral replication, spread, and targeting to the central nervous system in the absence of detectable antibodies or functional T cells."
10988,"Nude mice were infected orally, and the virus was monitored by plaque assay, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization."
10989,"Early during the infection (1 week), the variant virus induced an acute disease comparable to that induced by the wild-type virus in these nude mice."
10990,Alterations in tropism in the central nervous system were not apparent when wild-type parental Daniels strain virus was compared with the variant virus.
10991,"Moreover, variant virus replicated in tissue culture (BHK-21 cells) to similarly high titers in a time course identical to that of the wild-type virus (A. Zurbriggen and R. S. Fujinami, J. Virol."
10992,"63:1505-1513, 1989)."
10993,"However, replication of the variant virus versus the wild-type virus within the spinal cord of athymic nude mice infected per os was substantially restricted by 6 weeks postinfection."
10994,"Therefore, the reduced neurovirulence in the later stage (6 weeks) of the disease is most likely due to a diminished growth rate or spread of the variant virus in the central nervous system rather than to marked differences in viral tropism."
10995,Viral Proteins that Enhance Membrane Permeability
10996,: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a biased nucleotide composition different from human genes.
10997,"This raises the question of how evolution has chosen the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 that is observed today, or to what extent the actual encoding contributes to virus replication capacity, evolvability and pathogenesis."
10998,"Here, we applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach to HIV-1."
10999,"RESULTS: Using synonymous codon pairs, we rationally recoded and codon pair–optimized and deoptimized different moieties of the HIV-1 gag and pol genes."
11000,Deoptimized viruses had significantly lower viral replication capacity in MT-4 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
11001,"Varying degrees of ex vivo attenuation were obtained, depending upon both the specific deoptimized region and the number of deoptimized codons."
11002,A protease optimized virus carrying 38 synonymous mutations was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus in MT-4 cells and PBMCs.
11003,"Although attenuation is based on several tens of nucleotide changes, deoptimized HIV-1 reverted to wild-type virulence after serial passages in MT-4 cells."
11004,"Remarkably, no reversion was observed in the optimized virus."
11005,CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that SAVE is a useful strategy to phenotypically affect the replicative properties of HIV-1.
11006,"The primary target in multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be either myelin itself (myelinopathy) or the myelin-forming cell, the oligodendrocyte (oligodendrogliopathy)."
11007,"Although axonal injury occurs in MS, it is regarded as a secondary event to the myelin damage."
11008,"Here, the lesion develops from myelin (outside) to the axon (inside) (Outside-In model)."
11009,"Recently, gray matter lesions and axonal injury in normal-appearing white matter have also been reported in MS."
11010,This raises two questions.
11011,1) Is axonal injury exclusively secondary to myelin damage or from a direct insult to the axon or neurons (axonopathy)?
11012,"(2) Is the injured axon regarded as only an end result of pathology or disease, or can axonal injury contribute to the spread of secondary damage, including demyelination?"
11013,"The former is raised from the fact that axonal damage has been reported in several virus infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, herpes simplex virus and coronavirus, which also cause demyelination."
11014,"The latter possibility where axonal injury leads to other changes is raised from the rather unexpected similarity between spinal cord injury (SCI) and MS where axonal injury, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination are all present."
11015,"In SCI, transection of axons leads to delayed oligodendrocyte apoptosis with secondary demyelination."
11016,"Neurofilament immunostaining of spinal cord sections demonstrates that axonal injury with oligodendrocyte apoptosis also precedes demyelination in an animal model for MS, Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus infection."
11017,This implies that axonal injury could trigger demyelination.
11018,"In this instance, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model)."
11019,"A new human betacoronavirus in lineage c, tentatively called HCoV-EMC, was isolated from a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who died from acute severe pneumonia and renal failure."
11020,The viral RNA has been detected in eight additional cases.
11021,Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the viral genomic RNA showed that it is a novel virus not previously detected in any other species and that its closest relatives are two Asian bat coronaviruses.
11022,HCoV-EMC may represent a sporadic spillover to humans from an unknown animal reservoir.
11023,"In a recent article, van Boheemen et al."
11024,"demonstrated how state-of-the-art sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis can quickly provide critical insight into the viral genome sequence, phylogeny, replication strategy, and potential drug and vaccine targets and generate tools to evaluate the possible epidemic risk associated with this novel human virus."
11025,A SARS-CoV–Specific Protein Enhances Virulence of an Attenuated Strain of Mouse Hepatitis Virus
11026,"Influenza A remains a significant public health challenge because of the emergence of antigenically shifted or highly virulent strains(1,2,3,4,5)."
11027,"Antiviral resistance to available drugs such as adamantanes or neuraminidase inhibitors has appeared rapidly(6,7,8,9), creating a need for new antiviral targets and new drugs for influenza virus infections."
11028,"Using forward chemical genetics, we have identified influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) as a druggable target and found a small-molecule compound, nucleozin, that triggers the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation."
11029,Nucleozin impeded influenza A virus replication in vitro with a nanomolar median effective concentration (EC(50)) and protected mice challenged with lethal doses of avian influenza A H5N1.
11030,Our results demonstrate that viral NP is a valid target for the development of small-molecule therapies.
11031,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nbt.1638) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
11032,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, central nervous system disease mediated by myelin-specific T cells."
11033,Environmental triggers that cause a breakdown of myelin-specific T cell tolerance are unknown.
11034,We found that CD8(+) myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell tolerance can be broken and autoimmunity induced by infection with a virus that does not express MBP cross-reactive epitopes and does not depend on bystander activation.
11035,"Instead, the virus activated dual T cell receptor (TCR)-expressing T cells capable of recognizing both MBP and viral antigens."
11036,"These results demonstrate the importance of dual TCR T cells in autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected individuals, as hypothesized in the etiology of MS."
11037,Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the infected liver.
11038,Clinical interventions have been inefficient due to the lack of knowledge for inflammatory pathogenesis in the virus-infected liver.
11039,"We show that wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), a model for viral FH, manifest with severe disease and high mortality in association with a significant elevation in IL-1β expression in the serum and liver."
11040,"Whereas, the viral infection in IL-1β receptor-I deficient (IL-1R1 (-/-)) or IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) treated mice, show reductions in virus replication, disease progress and mortality."
11041,IL-1R1 deficiency appears to debilitate the virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) production in macrophages and CD45(+)Gr-1(high) neutrophil infiltration in the liver.
11042,The quick release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the infected macrophages suggests a plausible viral initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
11043,"Further experiments show that mice deficient of p47 (phox), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit that controls acute ROS production, present with reductions in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion during viral infection, which appears to be responsible for acquiring resilience to viral FH."
11044,"Moreover, viral infected animals in deficiencies of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, also have reduced IL-1β induction along with ameliorated hepatitis."
11045,"Our results demonstrate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis institutes an essential signaling pathway, which is over activated and directly causes the severe liver disease during viral infection, which sheds light on development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases."
11046,"High throughput, deep sequencing assays are powerful tools for gaining insights into virus–host interactions."
11047,Sequencing assays can discover novel viruses and describe the genomes of novel and known viruses.
11048,"Genomic information can predict viral proteins that can be characterized, describe important genes in the host that control infections, and evaluate gene expression of viruses and hosts during infection."
11049,Sequencing can also describe variation and evolution of viruses during replication and transmission.
11050,"This review recounts some of the major advances in the studies of virus–host interactions from the last two years, and discusses the uses of sequencing technologies relating to these studies."
11051,"In mid-February 2015, a large number of deaths were observed in the sole extant population of an endangered species of freshwater snapping turtle, Myuchelys georgesi, in a coastal river in New South Wales, Australia."
11052,Mortalities continued for approximately 7 weeks and affected mostly adult animals.
11053,"More than 400 dead or dying animals were observed and population surveys conducted after the outbreak had ceased indicated that only a very small proportion of the population had survived, severely threatening the viability of the wild population."
11054,"At necropsy, animals were in poor body condition, had bilateral swollen eyelids and some animals had tan foci on the skin of the ventral thighs."
11055,"Histological examination revealed peri-orbital, splenic and nephric inflammation and necrosis."
11056,A virus was isolated in cell culture from a range of tissues.
11057,Nucleic acid sequencing of the virus isolate has identified the entire genome and indicates that this is a novel nidovirus that has a low level of nucleotide similarity to recognised nidoviruses.
11058,"Its closest relatives are nidoviruses that have recently been described in pythons and lizards, usually in association with respiratory disease."
11059,"In contrast, in the affected turtles, the most significant pathological changes were in the kidneys."
11060,Real time PCR assays developed to detect this virus demonstrated very high virus loads in affected tissues.
11061,In situ hybridisation studies confirmed the presence of viral nucleic acid in tissues in association with pathological changes.
11062,Collectively these data suggest that this virus is the likely cause of the mortalities that now threaten the survival of this species.
11063,Bellinger River Virus is the name proposed for this new virus.
11064,The advent of high-throughput sequencing has led to a tremendous increase in the rate of discovery of viral sequences.
11065,"In some instances, novel pathogens have been identified."
11066,What has been less well appreciated is that novel virus discoveries in distinct hosts have led to the establishment of unique experimental systems to define host-virus interactions.
11067,These new systems have opened new frontiers in the study of fundamental virology and infectious disease.
11068,Incursions of new pathogenic viruses into humans from animal reservoirs are occurring with alarming frequency.
11069,"The molecular underpinnings of immune recognition, host responses, and pathogenesis in this setting are poorly understood."
11070,We studied pandemic influenza viruses to determine the mechanism by which increasing glycosylation during evolution of surface proteins facilitates diminished pathogenicity in adapted viruses.
11071,"ER stress during infection with poorly glycosylated pandemic strains activated the unfolded protein response, leading to inflammation, acute lung injury, and mortality."
11072,"Seasonal strains or viruses engineered to mimic adapted viruses displaying excess glycans on the hemagglutinin did not cause ER stress, allowing preservation of the lungs and survival."
11073,"We propose that ER stress resulting from recognition of non-adapted viruses is utilized to discriminate “non-self” at the level of protein processing and to activate immune responses, with unintended consequences on pathogenesis."
11074,Understanding this mechanism should improve strategies for treating acute lung injury from zoonotic viral infections.
11075,Molecular anatomy of viral RNA-directed RNA polymerases
11076, Hepatitis viruses are major threats to human health.
11077,"During the last decade, highly diverse viruses related to human hepatitis viruses were found in animals other than primates."
11078,"Herein, we describe both surprising conservation and striking differences of the unique biological properties and infection patterns of human hepatitis viruses and their animal homologues, including transmission routes, liver tropism, oncogenesis, chronicity, pathogenesis and envelopment."
11079,"We discuss the potential for translation of newly discovered hepatitis viruses into preclinical animal models for drug testing, studies on pathogenesis and vaccine development."
11080,"Finally, we re-evaluate the evolutionary origins of human hepatitis viruses and discuss the past and present zoonotic potential of their animal homologues."
11081,": Virus infections result in a range of clinical outcomes for the host, from asymptomatic to severe or even lethal disease."
11082,"Despite global efforts to prevent and treat virus infections to limit morbidity and mortality, the continued emergence and re-emergence of new outbreaks as well as common infections such as influenza persist as a health threat."
11083,Challenges to the prevention of severe disease after virus infection include both a paucity of protective vaccines as well as the early identification of individuals with the highest risk that may require supportive treatment.
11084,"METHODS: We completed a screen of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) that we infected with influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and West Nile virus."
11085,"RESULTS: The CC mice exhibited a range of disease manifestations upon infections, and we used this natural variation to identify strains with mortality after infection and strains exhibiting no mortality."
11086,We then used comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping to identify global baseline immune correlates of protection from mortality to virus infection.
11087,"CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that immune phenotypes might be leveraged to identify humans at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes upon infection, who may most benefit from intensive clinical interventions, in addition to providing insight for rational vaccine design."
11088," Viruses have been implicated in the initiation, progression, and exacerbation of several human autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis."
11089,"However, no single virus has been demonstrated as the etiologic agent."
11090,"Multiple different infections may be involved, first in priming the immune system for autoimmunity and then in triggering the actual disease."
11091,"A model based on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, has been developed, which shows that an initial early infection with a virus having molecular mimicry to self-epitopes can prime for disease that occurs after a subsequent non-specific immunologic stimulus, such as a different infection."
11092,The role of multiple infections in the development of autoimmune disease may explain why no one virus has been implicated.
11093,The emergence of new infectious diseases and old diseases with new pathogenic properties is a burgeoning worldwide problem.
11094,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are just two of the most widely reported recent emerging infectious diseases.
11095,What are the factors that contribute to the rapid evolution of viral species?
11096,"Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving opportunities for virus spread (for example, agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest clearing or air travel)."
11097,"However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered a contributing factor to the emergence of infectious disease."
11098,"In this review, we show that host nutritional status can influence not only the host response to the pathogen, but can also influence the genetic make-up of the viral genome."
11099,This latter finding markedly changes our concept of host–pathogen interactions and creates a new paradigm for the study of such phenomena.
11100, The discovery of new or divergent viruses using metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing has become more commonplace.
11101,The preparation of a sample is known to have an effect on the representation of virus sequences within the metagenomic dataset yet comparatively little attention has been given to this.
11102,Physical enrichment techniques are often applied to samples to increase the number of viral sequences and therefore enhance the probability of detection.
11103,"With the exception of virus ecology studies, there is a paucity of information available to researchers on the type of sample preparation required for a viral metagenomic study that seeks to identify an aetiological virus in an animal or human diagnostic sample."
11104,"A review of published virus discovery studies revealed the most commonly used enrichment methods, that were usually quick and simple to implement, namely low-speed centrifugation, filtration, nuclease-treatment (or combinations of these) which have been routinely used but often without justification."
11105,"These were applied to a simple and well-characterised artificial sample composed of bacterial and human cells, as well as DNA (adenovirus) and RNA viruses (influenza A and human enterovirus), being either non-enveloped capsid or enveloped viruses."
11106,The effect of the enrichment method was assessed by both quantitative real-time PCR and metagenomic analysis that incorporated an amplification step.
11107,"Reductions in the absolute quantities of bacteria and human cells were observed for each method as determined by qPCR, but the relative abundance of viral sequences in the metagenomic dataset remained largely unchanged."
11108,"A 3-step method of centrifugation, filtration and nuclease-treatment showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences."
11109,"This study provides a starting point for the selection of a purification method in future virus discovery studies, and highlights the need for more data to validate the effect of enrichment methods on different sample types, amplification, bioinformatics approaches and sequencing platforms."
11110,This study also highlights the potential risks that may attend selection of a virus enrichment method without any consideration for the sample type being investigated.
11111,Neutrophils are immune cells that are well known to be present during many types of lung diseases associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may contribute to acute lung injury.
11112,"Neutrophils are poorly studied with respect to viral infection, and specifically to respiratory viral disease."
11113,Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is the cause of a respiratory disease that poses a significant global public health concern.
11114,Influenza disease presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting although highly pathogenic forms exist.
11115,"Neutrophils increase in the respiratory tract during infection with mild seasonal IAV, moderate and severe epidemic IAV infection, and emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)."
11116,"During severe influenza pneumonia and HPAI infection, the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract is correlated with disease severity."
11117,"Thus, comparative analyses of the relationship between IAV infection and neutrophils provide insights into the relative contribution of host and viral factors that contribute to disease severity."
11118,"Herein, we review the contribution of neutrophils to IAV disease pathogenesis and to other respiratory virus infections."
11119,: Bioaerosol sampling devices are necessary for the characterization of infectious bioaerosols emitted by naturally‐infected hosts with acute respiratory virus infections.
11120,Assessment of these devices under multiple experimental conditions will provide insight for device use.
11121,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to assess and compare bioaerosol sampling devices using a) an in vitro, environmentally‐controlled artificial bioaerosol system at a range of different RH conditions and b) an in vivo bioaerosol system of influenza virus‐infected ferrets under controlled environmental conditions."
11122,"Secondarily, we also sought to examine the impact of NSAIDs on bioaerosol emission in influenza virus‐infected ferrets to address its potential as a determinant of bioaerosol emission."
11123,METHODS: We examined the performance of low and moderate volume bioaerosol samplers for the collection of viral RNA and infectious influenza virus in vitroand in vivo using artificial bioaerosols and the ferret model of influenza virus infection.
11124,"The following samplers were tested: the polytetrafluoroethylene filter (PTFE filter), the 2‐stage National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health cyclone sampler (NIOSH cyclone sampler) and the 6‐stage viable Andersen impactor (Andersen impactor)."
11125,RESULTS: The PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler collected similar amounts of viral RNA and infectious virus from artificially‐generated aerosols under a range of relative humidities (RH).
11126,"Using the ferret model, the PTFE filter, NIOSH cyclone sampler and the Andersen impactor collected up to 3.66 log(10)copies of RNA/L air, 3.84 log(10)copies of RNA/L air and 6.09 log(10)copies of RNA/L air respectively at peak recovery."
11127,Infectious virus was recovered from the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone samplers on the peak day of viral RNA recovery.
11128,CONCLUSION: The PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler are useful for influenza virus RNA and infectious virus collection and may be considered for clinical and environmental settings.
11129,Virus-Induced Demyelination: From Animal Models to Human Diseases
11130,: New prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are needed.
11131,We generated neutralizing anti-H5N1 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tested their efficacy for prophylaxis and therapy in a murine model of infection.
11132,METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using Epstein-Barr virus we immortalized memory B cells from Vietnamese adults who had recovered from infections with HPAI H5N1 viruses.
11133,Supernatants from B cell lines were screened in a virus neutralization assay.
11134,B cell lines secreting neutralizing antibodies were cloned and the mAbs purified.
11135,"The cross-reactivity of these antibodies for different strains of H5N1 was tested in vitro by neutralization assays, and their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo was tested in mice."
11136,"In vitro, mAbs FLA3.14 and FLD20.19 neutralized both Clade I and Clade II H5N1 viruses, whilst FLA5.10 and FLD21.140 neutralized Clade I viruses only."
11137,"In vivo, FLA3.14 and FLA5.10 conferred protection from lethality in mice challenged with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) in a dose-dependent manner."
11138,"mAb prophylaxis provided a statistically significant reduction in pulmonary virus titer, reduced associated inflammation in the lungs, and restricted extrapulmonary dissemination of the virus."
11139,"Therapeutic doses of FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 provided robust protection from lethality at least up to 72 h postinfection with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1)."
11140,"mAbs FLA3.14, FLD21.140 and FLD20.19, but not FLA5.10, were also therapeutically active in vivo against the Clade II virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1)."
11141,CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide proof of concept that fully human mAbs with neutralizing activity can be rapidly generated from the peripheral blood of convalescent patients and that these mAbs are effective for the prevention and treatment of H5N1 infection in a mouse model.
11142,"A panel of neutralizing, cross-reactive mAbs might be useful for prophylaxis or adjunctive treatment of human cases of H5N1 influenza."
11143,Prophylaxis with high doses of neutralizing antibody typically offers protection against challenge with viruses producing acute infections.
11144,"In this study, we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, KZ52, to protect against Ebola virus in rhesus macaques."
11145,This antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection.
11146,"Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge."
11147,A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment.
11148,Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection.
11149,We show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape.
11150,It appears that Ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody.
11151,Viruses have adapted a broad range of unique mechanisms to modulate the cellular translational machinery to ensure viral translation at the expense of cellular protein synthesis.
11152,Many of these promote virus-specific translation by use of molecular tags on viral mRNA such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and genome-linked viral proteins (VPg) that bind translation machinery components in unusual ways and promote RNA circularization.
11153,"This review describes recent advances in understanding some of the mechanisms in which animal virus mRNAs gain an advantage over cellular transcripts, including new structural and biochemical insights into IRES function and novel proteins that function as alternate met-tRNAi met carriers in translation initiation."
11154,Comparisons between animal and plant virus mechanisms that promote translation of viral mRNAs are discussed.
11155,": Rodents represent around 43% of all mammalian species, are widely distributed, and are the natural reservoirs of a diverse group of zoonotic viruses, including hantaviruses, Lassa viruses, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses."
11156,"Thus, analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could assist efforts to predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases."
11157,"RESULTS: We used next-generation sequencing metagenomic analysis to survey for a range of mammalian viral families in rodents and other small animals of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and Soricomorpha in China."
11158,"We sampled 3,055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra."
11159,Further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity.
11160,"Many viruses were reported for the first time with distinct evolutionary lineages, and viruses related to known human or animal pathogens were identified."
11161,Phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history.
11162,CONCLUSIONS: These results expand our understanding of the viromes of rodents and insectivores in China and suggest that there is high diversity of viruses awaiting discovery in these species in Asia.
11163,"These findings, combined with our previous bat virome data, greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot."
11164,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s40168-018-0554-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
11165, Investigations of the production and potential use of bovine interferons against viral infections have occurred since the first descriptions of interferons in other systems.
11166,The recent advent of recombinant DNA-technology has facilitated such studies and furthered our knowledge about the bovine interferon system in general.
11167,"This review gives an overview of the biology, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of bovine interferons."
11168,Areas in which the interferons are now applied or have potential application in viral diseases in cattle are described.
11169,"Finally, the value of studies of the bovine interferon system with respect to comparative interferon research is discussed."
11170," Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has morphological, physical and biochemical characteristics similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS in man."
11171,"However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated."
11172,FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced.
11173,"Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories."
11174,"During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy."
11175,After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome.
11176,"The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops."
11177,"Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes."
11178,"Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin."
11179,"Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion."
11180,The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years.
11181,Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelarate the progression of disease.
11182,"In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus."
11183,"Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation."
11184,"As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg++ preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro."
11185,Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV.
11186,The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced.
11187,"Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found."
11188,"Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF."
11189,"These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation."
11190,"When random cattle sera from the Netherlands were tested by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or radio-immunoprecipitation, 0.7% appeared seropositive; thus BIV infection is not uncommon in one European cattle population."
11191,: Zoonotic transmission events play a major role in the emergence of novel diseases.
11192,"While such events are virtually impossible to predict, wildlife screening for potential emerging pathogens can be a first step."
11193,"Driven by recent disease epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola, bats have gained special interest as reservoirs of emerging viruses."
11194,METHODS: As part of a bigger study investigating pathogens in African bats we screened animals for the presence of known and unknown viruses.
11195,RESULTS: We isolated and characterised a novel reovirus from blood of free-tailed bats (Chaereophon aloysiisabaudiae) captured in 2006 in Côte d’Ivoire.
11196,"The virus showed closest relationship with two human pathogenic viruses, Colorado tick fever virus and Eyach virus, and was able to infect various human cell lines in vitro."
11197,CONCLUSION: The study shows the presence of a coltivirus-related virus in bats from Sub-Sahara Africa.
11198,Serological studies could help to assess its impact on humans or wildlife health.
11199,"RNA viruses are ubiquitous intracellular parasites that are responsible for many emerging diseases, including AIDS and SARS."
11200,"Here, we discuss the principal mechanisms of RNA virus evolution and highlight areas where future research is required."
11201,"The rapidity of sequence change in RNA viruses means that they are useful experimental models for the study of evolution in general and it enables us to watch them change in 'real time', and retrace the spread through populations with molecular phylogenies."
11202,An understanding of the mechanisms of RNA virus sequence change is also crucial to predicting important aspects of their emergence and long-term evolution.
11203,": The clinical course of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a disease caused by TBE virus, ranges from asymptomatic or mild influenza-like infection to severe debilitating encephalitis or encephalomyelitis."
11204,"Despite the medical importance of this disease, some crucial steps in the development of encephalitis remain poorly understood."
11205,"In particular, the basis of the disease severity is largely unknown."
11206,"METHODS: TBE virus growth, neutralizing antibody response, key cytokine and chemokine mRNA production and changes in mRNA levels of cell surface markers of immunocompetent cells in brain were measured in mice with different susceptibilities to TBE virus infection."
11207,RESULTS: An animal model of TBE based on BALB/c-c-STS/A (CcS/Dem) recombinant congenic mouse strains showing different severities of the infection in relation to the host genetic background was developed.
11208,"After subcutaneous inoculation of TBE virus, BALB/c mice showed medium susceptibility to the infection, STS mice were resistant, and CcS-11 mice were highly susceptible."
11209,"The resistant STS mice showed lower and delayed viremia, lower virus production in the brain and low cytokine/chemokine mRNA production, but had a strong neutralizing antibody response."
11210,"The most sensitive strain (CcS-11) failed in production of neutralizing antibodies, but exhibited strong cytokine/chemokine mRNA production in the brain."
11211,"After intracerebral inoculation, all mouse strains were sensitive to the infection and had similar virus production in the brain, but STS mice survived significantly longer than CcS-11 mice."
11212,"These two strains also differed in the expression of key cytokines/chemokines, particularly interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in the brain."
11213,CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the genetic control is an important factor influencing the clinical course of TBE.
11214,"High neutralizing antibody response might be crucial for preventing host fatality, but high expression of various cytokines/chemokines during TBE can mediate immunopathology and be associated with more severe course of the infection and increased fatality."
11215,"In humans, viral infections of the respiratory tract are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide."
11216,Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS).
11217,"Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases."
11218,"Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals."
11219,"Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds."
11220,"However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."
11221,The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s.
11222,"In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals."
11223,"Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection."
11224,"Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process."
11225,"Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these recognized human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly understood."
11226,"Early in 2003, an outbreak of the until then unknown severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was reported in southeastern People’s Republic of China."
11227,The outbreak was thought to have first emerged in the Guangdong province in November 2002.
11228,"Subsequently, the infections spread to Hong Kong (February 2003) and other countries of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as to Canada and the United States (http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/sars/)."
11229, JHMV is a neurotropic member of the hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae.
11230,"The characteristics of the biology and intracellular viral RNA synthesis and the intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV are discussed in the two previous papers, respectively."
11231,This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV.
11232,These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i.
11233,= 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5° as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33°.
11234,N-Methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90–95%.
11235,"Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5°; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation."
11236,"RNA-minus ( 17 34 ), RNA-intermediate ( 14 34 ), and RNA-plus ( 3 34 ) groups were defined."
11237,"One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence."
11238,This altered neuropathogenesis cannot be explained by “leakiness” or reversion.
11239,"In addition, non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV have been selected for altered neuropathogenesis and are described."
11240,Two studies of H5N1 avian influenza viruses that had been genetically engineered to render them transmissible between ferrets have proved highly controversial.
11241,Divergent opinions exist about the importance of these studies of influenza transmission and about potential ‘dual use’ research implications.
11242,No consensus has developed yet about how to balance these concerns.
11243,"After not recommending immediate full publication of earlier, less complete versions of the studies, the United States National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity subsequently recommended full publication of more complete manuscripts; however, controversy about this and similar research remains."
11244,Thirty percent of weanling rats infected with JHM murine corona virus developed a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis approximately 3 weeks after intracerebral inoculation.
11245,"Small demyelinating foci were located in the deep cerebral white matter and large, sharply demarcated demyelinating lesions were detectable in optic chiasma, pons and spinal cord."
11246,Axons as well as neurons were well preserved in the demyelinating plaques in areas where the lesions extended to the gray matter.
11247,"Perivascular cuffings, consisting of plasma cells and mononuclear cells, were frequently found."
11248,"Viral antigen was found mostly in the white matter and in glial cells, leaving neurons unstained."
11249,Electron microscopic studies of the early lesions of white matter disclosed two different kinds of cell degeneration which developed prior to the myelin disruption and mononuclear cell infiltration.
11250,"One was a small pyknotic cell, which is thought to be an oligodendrocyte and the other is a ballooned cell containing abundant microtubules."
11251,Virus particles could be demonstrated only in the latter cell type.
11252,Discussion about astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes was made in relation to the initial stage of demyelination caused by virus infection.
11253,This animal model may be useful in the analysis of the mechanisms leading to demyelination in subacute or chronic infections.
11254, Serum and CSF specimens from clinically healthy Brown Norway (BN) rats inoculated intracerebrally with corona virus JHM were analysed with respect to the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intrathecal synthesis and isoelectric distribution of immunoglobulins (Ig).
11255,Increased CSF/serum ratios for Ig in the context of an intact BBB were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies.
11256,"Affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity, but no signs of oligoclonal Ig production carrying non-viral specificity."
11257,"From these data it was concluded that BN rats do control the intracerebral spread of JHM virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response, thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease."
11258,"Since 2015, 84 countries and territories reported evidence of vector-borne Zika Virus (ZIKV) transmission."
11259,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that ZIKV and associated consequences especially the neurological autoimmune disorder Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly will remain a significant enduring public health challenge requiring intense action.
11260,"We apply a standardization of the multi-subcutaneous dorsal inoculation method to systematically summarize clinical neurological manifestation, viral distribution, and tissue damage during the progress of viremia and systemic spread in suckling mouse models."
11261,We found that C57BL/6 and Kunming mice (KM) both showed remarkable and uniform neurologic manifestations.
11262,"C57BL/6 owned the highest susceptibility and pathogenicity to the nervous system, referred to as movement disorders, with 100% incidence, while KM was an economic model for a Chinese study characterized by lower limb weakness with 62% morbidity."
11263,"Slight yellow extraocular exudates were observed in BALB/c, suggesting the association with similar ocular findings to those of clinical cases."
11264,"The virus distribution and pathological changes in the sera, brains, livers, kidneys, spleens, and testes during disease progression had strong regularity and uniformity, demonstrating the effectiveness and plasticity of the animal models."
11265,The successful establishment of these animal models will be conducive to expound the pathogenic mechanism of GBS.
11266,India is considered as a hot spot for emerging infectious diseases.
11267,In the recent past many infectious diseases of emerging and re-emerging nature have entered this subcontinent and affected a large number of populations.
11268,"A few examples are Nipah, Avian influenza, Pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus and Chikungunya virus."
11269,These diseases have not only affected human and animal health but also economy of the country on a very large scale.
11270,"During December 2010, National Institute of Virology, Pune detected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus specific IgG antibodies in livestock serum samples from Gujarat and Rajasthan states."
11271,"Subsequently, during January 2011 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus was confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak, in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India."
11272,"Retrospective investigation of suspected human samples confirmed that the virus was present in Gujarat state, earlier to this outbreak."
11273,This disease has a case fatality rate ranging from 5 to 80 %.
11274,"Earlier presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies have been detected in animal sera from Jammu and Kashmir, the western border districts, southern regions and Maharashtra state of India."
11275,"The evidences of virus activity and antibodies were observed during and after the outbreak in human beings, ticks and domestic animals (buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep) from Gujarat State of India."
11276,"During the year 2012, this virus was again reported in human beings and animals."
11277,"Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the four isolates of 2011, as well as the S segment from specimen of 2010 and 2012 were highly conserved and clustered together in the Asian/Middle East genotype IV."
11278,The S segment of South-Asia 2 type was closest to a Tajikistan strain TADJ/HU8966 of 1990.
11279,"The present scenario in India suggests the need to look seriously into various important aspects of this zoonotic disease, which includes diagnosis, intervention, patient management, control of laboratory acquired and nosocomial infection, tick control, livestock survey and this, should be done in priority before it further spreads to other states."
11280,"Being a high risk group pathogen, diagnosis is a major concern in India where only a few Biosafety level 3 laboratories exist and it needs to be addressed immediately before this disease becomes endemic in India."
11281,Cancer is one of the leading health concerns for human and animal health.
11282,"Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms."
11283,"Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique."
11284,A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus.
11285,The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive.
11286,"The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death."
11287,All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency.
11288,"Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma."
11289,It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.
11290,Inflammatory responses contribute to the morbidity and mortality of severe influenza.
11291,Current antiviral therapy offers limited success in treating severe influenza infection with both H1N1 and H5N1 viruses.
11292,"We evaluated the effect of a neuraminidase inhibitor in combination with immunomodulatory drugs in vitro and in a mouse model of influenza A H1N1 infection by determining survival rate, lung inflammation markers and histopathology."
11293,Sertraline and rolipram significantly improved survival in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A H1N1 virus.
11294,"Prophylactic treatment resulted in survival rates of 40% (rolipram), 30% (oseltamivir), 0% (sertraline), 100% (rolipram/oseltamivir) and 70% (sertraline/oseltamivir)."
11295,Treatment in a therapeutic setting (24 h post-infection) resulted in 80% (rolipram/oseltamivir) and 40% (sertraline/oseltamivir) survival.
11296,"Sertraline and rolipram had no effect on virus replication in vitro and in vivo, but significantly reduced lung inflammation."
11297,"A significant reduction in cellular infiltration (10-fold) along with inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (10-fold), interleukin-6 (5-fold) and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (5-fold) was observed in the animals treated with the combination compared to oseltamivir alone."
11298,"Lung histopathology of mice treated with combinations revealed significantly reduced consolidation, infiltration and alveolitis compared to oseltamivir alone."
11299,Rolipram and sertraline reduced H1N1 virus-induced lung inflammation and mortality.
11300,These data support further development of immunomodulatory agents for severe influenza.
11301,Phenomenon of RNA-induced gene silencing is a highly conservative mechanism among eukaryotic organisms.
11302,"Several classes of small RNAs (siRNAs and miRNAs) 21–25 nt in length, which play a significant role in the processes of development of an organism, occurred important components of antiviral defence in animals and plants."
11303,"This review shortly describes the main stages of gene silencing mechanism, features of antiviral RNA silencing in plants, invertebrates, mammals, ways of suppression of RNA-interference by viruses, as well as possible approaches of utilization of abovementioned phenomenon for struggling against viral infections."
11304,Interdisciplinarity and Infectious Diseases: An Ebola Case Study
11305," The precise mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is still unclear."
11306,"We generated recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) LC16m8 strain which simultaneously expresses four structural proteins of SARS-CoV, including nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E), spike (S) proteins (rVV-NMES) and reported that old BALB/c mice having prior immunization with rVV-NMES develop severe pneumonia similar to those of control mice though rVV-NMES-immunized mice showed lower pulmonary viral titer than in the control mice."
11307,"Furthermore, we determined which SARS-CoV structural protein for the prior rVV-immunization is responsible for the severe pneumonia after the SARS-CoV infection as observed in the rVV-NMES-immunized mice."
11308,"Old BALB/c mice were inoculated intradermally with rVV that expressed each structural proteins of SARS-CoV (rVV-N, -M, -E, or -S) with or without rVV-S and then infected intranasally with SARS-CoV more than 4 weeks later."
11309,"At 9 days after SARS-CoV infection, the rVV-N-immunized mice show more severe pneumonia than in other groups."
11310,"Furthermore, significant up-regulation of Th1 (IL-2)- and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5)-bias cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β) were observed in rVV-N-immunized mice, resulting in the intensive infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the lung."
11311,"In contrast, rVV-S-immunized mice showed only low pulmonary viral tier and slight pneumonia."
11312,"However, the mice having co-immunization with both rVV-N and rVV-S showed severe pneumonia though their pulmonary viral titer was low."
11313,These results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the N protein of SARS-CoV is involved in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection.
11314,These findings increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.
11315,Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) have been implicated both in the control and pathogenesis of influenza virus infection.
11316,"We demonstrate that pDC depletion has marked effects on the response of mononuclear phagocytes, including conventional DCs (cDCs) and macrophages, to lethal influenza virus infection."
11317,Infection of mice lacking pDCs through antibody-mediated depletion resulted in substantially increased accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes and their progenitors in lungs compared to non-treated controls.
11318,pDC ablation resulted in a 5- to 35-fold enhancement of intracellular TNF-α and IL-6 production from inflammatory cDCs and exudate macrophages.
11319,Purified pulmonary cDCs and macrophages cultured from pDC-depleted mice produced significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared to pDC-intact counterparts.
11320,Elimination of pDCs resulted in decreased lung IFN-α and an immediate and transient reduction in lung virus burden but did not impact disease outcome.
11321,These data reveal a suppressive effect of pDCs on the inflammatory response to influenza virus infection in the lung.
11322,Influenza D virus (IDV) is unique among four types of influenza viruses in that it utilizes cattle as a primary reservoir.
11323,"The thermal and acid stability of IDV were examined and directly compared with those of influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), and influenza C virus (ICV)."
11324,"The results of our experiments demonstrated that only IDV had a high residual infectivity (~2.5 log units of 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID(50)]/ml) after a 60-min exposure to 53°C in solution at a neutral pH, and remarkably, IDV retained this infectivity even after exposure to 53°C for 120 min."
11325,"Furthermore, the data showed that IDV was extremely resistant to inactivation by low pH."
11326,"After being treated at pH 3.0 for 30 min, IDV lost only approximately 20% of its original infectiousness, while all other types of influenza viruses were completely inactivated."
11327,"Finally, replacement of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of a temperature- and acid-sensitive IAV with the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein of a stable IDV through a reverse genetic system largely rendered the recombinant IAVs resistant to high-temperature and low-pH treatments."
11328,"Together, these results indicated that the HEF glycoprotein is a primary determinant of the exceptional temperature and acid tolerance of IDV."
11329,"Further investigation into the viral entry and fusion mechanism mediated by the intrinsically stable HEF protein of IDV may offer novel insights into how the fusion machinery of influenza viruses evolve to achieve acid and thermal stability, which as a result promotes the potential to transmit across mammal species."
11330,IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (IDV) utilizes cattle as a primary reservoir.
11331,Increased outbreaks in pigs and serological evidence of human infection have raised a concern about the potential of IDV adapting to humans.
11332,"Here, we directly compared IDV’s stability to that of other influenza types (A, B, and C) following prolonged incubation at high temperatures or in a low-pH environment."
11333,We found that IDV is the most stable of the four types of influenza viruses.
11334,"Importantly, we demonstrated that the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein, which drives the fusion between viral and host cell membranes, is the primary determinant for the high thermal and acid stability of IDV."
11335,"Considering that there is a link between the acid stability of the hemagglutinin protein of influenza A virus and its cross-species transmission, further investigation of the mechanism of HEF-directed viral tolerance may offer novel insights into tissue tropism and cross-species transmission of influenza viruses."
11336,"A variety of neurological diseases in humans, including multiple sclerosis (MS), have been postulated to have a viral etiology."
11337,The use of animal models provides insights into potential mechanism(s) involved in the disease process.
11338,The murine coronavirus-induced demyelinating disease in rodents is one such model for demyelinating disease in humans.
11339,"At the end of 2002, the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported, and in the following year, SARS resulted in considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide."
11340,SARS is caused by a novel species of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is the most severe coronavirus-mediated human disease that has been described so far.
11341,"On the basis of similarities with other coronavirus infections, SARS might, in part, be immune mediated."
11342,"As discussed in this Review, studies of animals that are infected with other coronaviruses indicate that excessive and sometimes dysregulated responses by macrophages and other pro-inflammatory cells might be particularly important in the pathogenesis of disease that is caused by infection with these viruses."
11343,It is hoped that lessons from such studies will help us to understand more about the pathogenesis of SARS in humans and to prevent or control outbreaks of SARS in the future.
11344,Humanized mice are crucial tools for studying human pathogens in systemic situations.
11345,"An animal model of human coronavirus infectious disease has been generated by gene transfer of the human receptor for virus-cell interaction (aminopeptidase N, APN, CD13) into mice."
11346,We showed that in vitro and in vivo infections across the species barrier differ in their requirements.
11347,Transgenic cells were susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-229E infection demonstrating the requirement of hAPN for viral cell entry.
11348,"Transgenic mice, however, could not be infected suggesting additional requirements for in vivo virus susceptibility."
11349,Crossing hAPN transgenic mice with interferon unresponsive Stat1(−/− )mice resulted in markedly enhanced virus replication in vitro but did not result in detectable virus replication in vivo.
11350,Adaptation of the human virus to murine cells led to successful infection of the humanized transgenic mice.
11351,Future genetic engineering approaches are suggested to provide animal models for the better understanding of human infectious diseases.
11352,": The urgent medical need for innovative approaches to control influenza is emphasized by the widespread resistance of circulating subtype H1N1 viruses to the leading antiviral drug oseltamivir, the pandemic threat posed by the occurrences of human infections with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses, and indeed the evolving swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic."
11353,"A recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans."
11354,Here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class.
11355,"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus in ferrets, the optimal model of human influenza infection."
11356,"Survival rates, clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature, virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract, as well as macro- and microscopic pathology were investigated."
11357,"Prophylactic administration of 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 prior to viral challenge completely prevented mortality, weight loss and reduced the amount of infectious virus in the lungs by more than 99.9%, abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions and largely prevented H5N1-induced lung pathology."
11358,"When administered therapeutically 1 day after challenge, 30 mg/kg CR6261 prevented death in all animals and blunted disease, as evidenced by decreased weight loss and temperature rise, reduced lung viral loads and shedding, and less lung damage."
11359,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant animal model of influenza and justify clinical development of this approach as intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza.
11360,RNA recombination is one of the driving forces of genetic variability in (+)-strand RNA viruses.
11361,Various types of RNA–RNA crossovers were described including crosses between the same or different viral RNAs or between viral and cellular RNAs.
11362,"Likewise, a variety of molecular mechanisms are known to support RNA recombination, such as replicative events (based on internal or end-to-end replicase switchings) along with non-replicative joining among RNA fragments of viral and/or cellular origin."
11363,Such mechanisms as RNA decay or RNA interference are responsible for RNA fragmentation and trans-esterification reactions which are likely accountable for ligation of RNA fragments.
11364,Numerous host factors were found to affect the profiles of viral RNA recombinants and significant differences in recombination frequency were observed among various RNA viruses.
11365,Comparative analyses of viral sequences allowed for the development of evolutionary models in order to explain adaptive phenotypic changes and co-evolving sites.
11366,Many questions remain to be answered by forthcoming RNA recombination research.
11367,"(1) How various factors modulate the ability of viral replicase to switch templates, (2) What is the intracellular location of RNA–RNA template switchings, (3) Mechanisms and factors responsible for non-replicative RNA recombination, (4) Mechanisms of integration of RNA viral sequences with cellular genomic DNA, and (5) What is the role of RNA splicing and ribozyme activity."
11368,"From an evolutionary stand point, it is not known how RNA viruses parasitize new host species via recombination, nor is it obvious what the contribution of RNA recombination is among other RNA modification pathways."
11369,We do not understand why the frequency of RNA recombination varies so much among RNA viruses and the status of RNA recombination as a form of sex is not well documented.
11370, Interferons (IFNs) are a first line of defense against viral infection.
11371,Herein we describe the use of an adenovirus vectored mouse IFN alpha gene (mDEF201) as a prophylactic and treatment countermeasure in a SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model.
11372,"Complete survival protection was observed in mice given a single dose of mDEF201 administered intranasally 1, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days prior to lethal SARS-CoV challenge (p <0.001), and body weights of these treated mice were unaffected by the challenge."
11373,"In addition, low doses of mDEF201 protected lungs in a dose dependent manner as measured by a reduction in gross pathology."
11374,Intranasal treatment with mDEF201 ranging from 106 to 108 PFU significantly protected mice against a lethal SARS-CoV infection in a dose dependent manner up to 12h post infection (p <0.001).
11375,The data suggest that mDEF201 is a new class of antiviral agent further development as treatment for SARS-CoV infections.
11376,Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of mice is an animal model for human demyelinating diseases.
11377,"To further define the role of this virus in the disease process, we selected a virus variant resistant to neutralization by a monoclonal antibody to VP-1."
11378,This virus variant was then injected into SJL/J mice.
11379,Central nervous system tissue was compared between variant virus- and wild-type virus-infected mice.
11380,"Within the brain, no large differences were observed between the two groups as to the distribution of inflammatory infiltrates around the injection site and the number of viral antigen-positive cells during the first weeks of the observation period."
11381,"In contrast, in the spinal cord major differences were found between variant virus- and wild-type virus-infected mice regarding the number of inflammatory lesions, infected cells, and the size of the areas involved with time."
11382,"By immunohistochemistry, equivalent numbers of infected cells could be found in the spinal cord 1 week postinfection (p.i."
11383,"): however, after that time, the number of infected cells in the wild-type virus-infected mice continued to increase, whereas the virus-positive cells from the variant virus-infected mice gradually decreased."
11384,"Thus, the number of viral antigen-containing cells peaked by 1 week p.i."
11385,in the variant virus-infected animals.
11386,"Conversely, the number of infected cells in the spinal cords from mice inoculated with wild-type virus steadily increased until 8 weeks p.i."
11387,At this time (8 weeks p.i.
11388,"), no more variant virus antigen-positive cells could be observed within the spinal cord."
11389,Plaque assay of central nervous system tissue confirmed these differences between the two groups observed by immunohistochemistry.
11390,No infectious variant virus could be isolated after 2 weeks p.i.
11391,from the brain and 4 weeks p.i.
11392,"from the spinal cord, whereas infectious wild-type virus could be detected up to the end of the observation period (12 weeks p.i.)."
11393,Virus which was isolated from variant virus-infected mice still retained the neutralization-resistant phenotype.
11394,These studies emphasize the important biological in vivo activity of Theiler's virus VP-1 in determining neurovirulence.
11395," Arenaviruses are enveloped, negative-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the family Arenaviridae."
11396,"This diverse family can be further classified into OW (Old World) and NW (New World) arenaviruses based on their antigenicity, phylogeny, and geographical distribution."
11397,"Many of the NW arenaviruses are highly pathogenic viruses that cause systemic human infections characterized by hemorrhagic fever and/or neurological manifestations, constituting public health problems in their endemic regions."
11398,"NW arenavirus infection induces a variety of host innate immune responses, which could contribute to the viral pathogenesis and/or influence the final outcome of virus infection in vitro and in vivo."
11399,"On the other hand, NW arenaviruses have also developed several strategies to counteract the host innate immune response."
11400,"We will review current knowledge regarding the interplay between the host innate immune response and NW arenavirus infection in vitro and in vivo, with emphasis on viral-encoded proteins and their effect on the type I interferon response."
11401,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), an enveloped DNA virus, plays a key role in varieties of diseases including recurrent cold sores, keratoconjunctivitis, genital herpes and encephalitis in humans."
11402,"Great efforts have been made in developing more effective and less side-effects anti-herpes simplex virus agents, including traditional Chinese herbal medicines."
11403,"In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of Rheum tanguticum nanoparticles against HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo."
11404,R. tanguticum nanoparticles could inactivate the HSV-1 virions and block the viral attachment and entry into cells.
11405,Time-of-addition assay indicated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could interfere with the entire phase of viral replication.
11406,"Besides, R. tanguticum nanoparticles showed the ability to inhibit the mRNA expression of HSV-1 immediate early gene ICP4 and early gene ICP8 as well as the expression of viral protein ICP4 and ICP8."
11407,"Moreover, R. tanguticum nanoparticles have been proved to protect mice against HSV-1 induced lethality by decreasing the viral load and alleviated pathological changes in brain tissues."
11408,"In conclusion, we demonstrated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could inhibit HSV-1 infection through multiple mechanisms."
11409,These results suggest that R. tanguticum nanoparticles may have novel roles in the treatment of HSV-1 infection.
11410,Identifying emerging viral pathogens and characterizing their transmission is essential to developing effective public health measures in response to an epidemic.
11411,"Phylogenetics, though currently the most popular tool used to characterize the likely host of a virus, can be ambiguous when studying species very distant to known species and when there is very little reliable sequence information available in the early stages of the outbreak of disease."
11412,"Motivated by an existing framework for representing biological sequence information, we learn sparse, tree-structured models, built from decision rules based on subsequences, to predict viral hosts from protein sequence data using popular discriminative machine learning tools."
11413,"Furthermore, the predictive motifs robustly selected by the learning algorithm are found to show strong host-specificity and occur in highly conserved regions of the viral proteome."
11414,"Viral fitness is an active area of research, with recent work involving an expanded number of human, non-human vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, and bacterial viruses."
11415,"Many publications deal with RNA viruses associated with major disease emergence events, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, and Dengue virus."
11416,"Study topics include drug resistance, immune escape, viral emergence, host jumps, mutation effects, quasispecies diversity, and mathematical models of viral fitness."
11417,"Important recent trends include increasing use of in vivo systems to assess vertebrate virus fitness, and a broadening of research beyond replicative fitness to also investigate transmission fitness and epidemiologic fitness."
11418,"This is essential for a more integrated understanding of overall viral fitness, with implications for disease management in the future."
11419,Nipah virus is a broadly tropic and highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus whose natural reservoirs are several species of Pteropus fruit bats.
11420,Nipah virus has repeatedly caused outbreaks over the past decade associated with a severe and often fatal disease in humans and animals.
11421,"Here, a new ferret model of Nipah virus pathogenesis is described where both respiratory and neurological disease are present in infected animals."
11422,Severe disease occurs with viral doses as low as 500 TCID(50) within 6 to 10 days following infection.
11423,"The underlying pathology seen in the ferret closely resembles that seen in Nipah virus infected humans, characterized as a widespread multisystemic vasculitis, with virus replicating in highly vascular tissues including lung, spleen and brain, with recoverable virus from a variety of tissues."
11424,"Using this ferret model a cross-reactive neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, m102.4, targeting the henipavirus G glycoprotein was evaluated in vivo as a potential therapeutic agent."
11425,All ferrets that received m102.4 ten hours following a high dose oral-nasal Nipah virus challenge were protected from disease while all controls died.
11426,This study is the first successful post-exposure passive antibody therapy for Nipah virus using a human monoclonal antibody.
11427," The early cytokines interferon-α (IFN-α), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1, -6 and -8 (IL-1, -6, -8) are produced during the most early stage of an infection."
11428,"The activities of these cytokines have been studied extensively in vitro and in rodents, but in vivo studies on the role of these cytokines in infectious diseases of food animals are few."
11429,"This review concentrates on in vivo studies of cytokine involvement in infectious respiratory diseases of swine, with an emphasis on viral infections."
11430,First evidence for the role of early cytokines in pneumonia in swine came from experimental infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
11431,The role of TNF-α and IL-1 in the symptoms and pathology of porcine pleuropneumonia has recently been proven by use of an adenovirus vector expressing the anti-inflammatory IL-10.
11432,"In the authors’ laboratory, studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between viral respiratory disease and bioactive lung lavage levels of IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6."
11433,"Out of three respiratory viruses—porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV)—only SIV induced acute respiratory disease and severe lung damage by itself."
11434,"Disease and lung pathology were tightly associated with the simultaneous production of IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6."
11435,"In challenge studies of SIV-vaccinated pigs, levels of IFN-α, TNF-α and IL-6, but not IL-1 were correlated with clinical and virological protection."
11436,Multifactorial respiratory disease was reproduced by combined inoculations with PRCV or PRRSV followed by LPS from Escherichia coli.
11437,"In comparison with the respective single inoculations, which were subclinical, there was a true potentiation of disease and production of TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6."
11438,TNF-α and IL-6 were best correlated with disease.
11439,"In further studies, we will use more specific strategies to dissect the role of cytokines during viral infections."
11440," Studies were undertaken to investigate the antiviral effects of comestible juices, especially cranberry juice, on non-related viral species."
11441,"After exposure of bacteriophage T2 to a commercially available cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) juice cocktail (CJ), virus infectivity titer was no longer detectible."
11442,"After a 60-min exposure to orange (OJ) and grapefruit juices (GJ), phage infectivity was reduced to 25–35% of control, respectively."
11443,Similar data were observed for the bacteriophage T4.
11444,"CJ inactivation of phage T4 was rapid, dose-dependent, and occurred at either 4 or 23°C."
11445,Neither pH nor differences in sugar/carbohydrate levels among the juices may be ascribed to the recognized antiviral effects.
11446,Further studies were performed to identify the occurrence of antiviral activity by CJ to a mammalian enteric virus.
11447,The treatment of the simian rotavirus SA-11 with a 20% CJ suspension was sufficient to inhibit hemagglutination.
11448,"Under scanning and transmission electron microscopy, CJ was observed to inhibit the adsorption of phage T4 to its bacterial host cells and prevented the replication of rotavirus in its monkey kidney (MA-104) host cells, respectively."
11449,"The data suggest, for the first time, a non-specific antiviral effect towards unrelated viral species (viz., bacteriophages T2 and T4 and the simian rotavirus SA-11) by a commercially available cranberry fruit juice drink."
11450, Infection with an avirulent strain of Semliki Forest virus (SFV-A7) facilitates the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a genetically resistant BALB/c mouse strain.
11451,Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice.
11452,EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared.
11453,Entry of perivascular CD4+ and CD8+ cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1+ cells in the central nervous system (CNS).
11454,"In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1+ cells and a few CD4+ and CD8+ cells."
11455,Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase.
11456,SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS.
11457,Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7.
11458,We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice.
11459,"SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS."
11460,The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.
11461,"  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease of young adults, affecting an estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States alone."
11462,The majority of affected individuals have a relapsing–remitting course while a smaller subset has a more chronic–progressive presentation.
11463,"Women are affected more often than men, a phenomenon associated with a number of auto-immune diseases."
11464,"Although the etiology of MS is unknown, it is generally believed that genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors are involved."
11465,This chapter discusses these issues as they suggest that exogenous factors are associated with the pathogenesis of this disorder.
11466,"Recently, the human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) has received considerable attention as an infectious agent candidate that might be associated with the pathogenesis of MS."
11467,The chapter focuses on this agent and the data that support the role of this virus in MS disease pathogenesis.
11468,"A model is proposed, whereby in genetically susceptible individuals, multiple viruses may trigger either a virus-specific or a cross-reactive auto-immune response that results in clinical MS. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that it is a multifactorial disease that develops as a result of host genetics, immune response, and environment."
11469,Innate immune responses play a critical role in the control of early virus replication and dissemination.
11470,"It remains unknown, however, how SARS-CoV evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection."
11471,"Here, we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by T cells, MAC387(+) and CD163(+) monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway."
11472,Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells (LCs) and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes (LNs) within 2 days.
11473,"In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days."
11474,Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days.
11475,"This study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal interactions of SARS-CoV, monocytes/macrophages and the dendritic cell network in mucosal tissues and highlights the fact that while these innate cells contribute to viral clearance, they probably also serve as shelters and vehicles to provide a mechanism for the virus to escape host mucosal innate immunity and disseminate systemically."
11476,A bio-objects approach to biosecurity: the “mutant flu” controversy as a bio-objectification process
11477," Enterovirus B (EV-B), a major proportion of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae, is the causative agent of severe human infectious diseases."
11478,"Although cellular receptors for coxsackievirus B in EV-B have been identified, receptors mediating virus entry, especially the uncoating process of echovirus and other EV-B remain obscure."
11479,"Here, we found that human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the uncoating receptor for major EV-B."
11480,FcRn binds to the virus particles in the “canyon” through its FCGRT subunit.
11481,"By obtaining multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures at different stages of virus entry at atomic or near-atomic resolution, we deciphered the underlying mechanisms of enterovirus attachment and uncoating."
11482,"These structures revealed that different from the attachment receptor CD55, binding of FcRn to the virions induces efficient release of “pocket factor” under acidic conditions and initiates the conformational changes in viral particle, providing a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of enterovirus entry."
11483,"Autoreactive T cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP), a major component of central nervous system (CNS) protein, are frequently found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis."
11484,"This autoimmune syndrome is a CNS complication after infections with a number of different enveloped viruses, e.g."
11485,"mumps, measles, rubella, influenza and varicella."
11486,"However, the pathophysiological mechanism leading to this breaking of natural self tolerance in the course of viral infection remains an enigma."
11487,A long-lasting hypothesis has suggested that incorporation of cellular (self) proteins into the envelope of budding viruses might be a possible mechanism leading to autosensitization.
11488,"In a model study we demonstrate here that vesicular stomatitis virus (VS V), grown in myelin protein-expressing cell cultures, is highly efficient in triggering T cell responses to MBP in vitro and can prime autoreactive T cell immune responses in vivo."
11489,"On the basis of these findings, we suggest that incorporation of CNS membrane components into the viral envelope and subsequent priming of self-reactive immune responses might be the common pathogenic mechanism underlying the postinfectious encephalomyelitis syndrome."
11490," In this review, we summarize the researches on animal reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)."
11491,Masked palm civets were suspected as the origin of the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was confirmed as the direct origin of SARS cases with mild symptom in 2004.
11492,"Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human SARS-CoV with nt identity over 99.6%, indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time."
11493,Alignment of 10 complete viral genome sequences from masked palm civets with those of human SARS-CoVs revealed 26 conserved single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the viruses from masked palm civets.
11494,These conserved SNVs were gradually lost from the genomes of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 SARS epidemic.
11495,"In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as the natural reservoir of a group of coronaviruses that are distantly related to SARS-CoV."
11496,The genome sequences of bat SARS-like coronavirus had about 88–92% nt identity with that of the SARS-CoV.
11497,The prevalence of antibodies and viral RNA in different bat species and the characteristics of the bat SARS-like coronavirus were elucidated.
11498,"Apart from masked palm civets and bats, 29 other animal species had been tested for the SARS-CoV, and the results are summarized in this paper."
11499,Positive-sense (+) RNA viruses represent the most abundant group of viruses and are dependent on the host cell machinery to replicate.
11500,"One remarkable feature that occurs after (+) RNA virus entry into cells is the remodeling of host endomembranes, leading to the formation of viral replication factories."
11501,"Recently, rapid progress in three-dimensional (3D) imaging technologies, such as electron tomography (ET) and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), has enabled researchers to visualize the novel membrane structures induced by viruses at high resolution."
11502,These 3D imaging technologies provide new mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle.
11503,"In this review, we summarize the latest reports on the cellular remodeling that occurs during plant virus infection; in particular, we focus on studies that provide 3D architectural information on viral replication factories."
11504,We also outline the mechanisms underlying the formation of these membranous structures and discuss possible future research directions.
11505,"In July 1962, the author joined the Food Research Institute (FRI), then at the University of Chicago, to become its food virologist."
11506,There was a limited record of waterborne viral disease outbreaks at the time; recorded data on foodborne outbreaks were fewer still.
11507,"Laboratory environmental (water and wastewater) virology was in its infancy, and food virology was in gestation."
11508,"Detection of viruses was most often attempted by inoculation of primary primate cell cultures, with observation for plaque formation or cytopathic effects."
11509,Focus was initially on enteroviruses and reoviruses.
11510,"Environmental and food samples had to be liquefied if not already in liquid form; clarified to remove solids, bacteria, and fungi; and concentrated to a volume that could be tested in cell culture."
11511,Cytotoxicity was also a concern.
11512,Studies at the FRI and some other laboratories addressed all of these challenges.
11513,The FRI group was the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Food Virology for many years.
11514,"Other topics studied were virus inactivation as functions of temperature, time, matrix, disinfectants, and microbial action; peroral and ex-vivo infectivity; and the suitability of various virus surrogates for environmental monitoring and inactivation experiments."
11515,"Detection of noroviruses and hepatitis A virus required molecular methods, most often RT-PCR."
11516,"When it was found that inactivated virus often gave the same RT-PCR signal as that of infectious virus, sample treatments were sought, which would prevent false-positive test results."
11517,"Many laboratories around the world have taken up food and environmental virology since 1962, with the result that a dedicated journal has been launched."
11518,Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in wildlife are major threats both to human health and to biodiversity conservation.
11519,An estimated 71.8 % of zoonotic EID events are caused by pathogens in wildlife and the incidence of such diseases is increasing significantly in humans.
11520,"In addition, human diseases are starting to infect wildlife, especially non-human primates."
11521,"The chimpanzee is an endangered species that is threatened by human activity such as deforestation, poaching, and human disease transmission."
11522,"Recently, several respiratory disease outbreaks that are suspected of having been transmitted by humans have been reported in wild chimpanzees."
11523,"Therefore, we need to study zoonotic pathogens that can threaten captive chimpanzees in primate research institutes."
11524,Serological surveillance is one of several methods used to reveal infection history.
11525,We examined serum from 14 captive chimpanzees in Japanese primate research institutes for antibodies against 62 human pathogens and 1 chimpanzee-borne infectious disease.
11526,Antibodies tested positive against 29 pathogens at high or low prevalence in the chimpanzees.
11527,"These results suggest that the proportions of human-borne infections may reflect the chimpanzee’s history, management system in the institute, or regional epidemics."
11528,"Furthermore, captive chimpanzees are highly susceptible to human pathogens, and their induced antibodies reveal not only their history of infection, but also the possibility of protection against human pathogens."
11529,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10329-012-0320-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
11530,Viral infections affect three to five million patients annually.
11531,"While commonly used antivirals often show limited efficacy and serious adverse effects, herbal extracts have been in use for medicinal purposes since ancient times and are known for their antiviral properties and more tolerable side effects."
11532,"Thus, naturally based pharmacotherapy may be a proper alternative for treating viral diseases."
11533,"With that in mind, various pharmaceutical formulations and delivery systems including micelles, nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, solid dispersions, microspheres and crystals, self-nanoemulsifying and self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS and SMEDDS) have been developed and used for antiviral delivery of natural products."
11534,These diverse technologies offer effective and reliable delivery of medicinal phytochemicals.
11535,"Given the challenges and possibilities of antiviral treatment, this review provides the verified data on the medicinal plants and related herbal substances with antiviral activity, as well as applied strategies for the delivery of these plant extracts and biologically active phytochemicals."

11537,": The selection of stably expressed reference genes is a prerequisite when evaluating gene expression, via real-time PCR, in cells in response to viral infections."
11538,The objective of our study was to identify suitable reference genes for mRNA expression analysis in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) after infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J).
11539,FINDINGS: The expression levels of 11 potential reference genes in CEF infected with ALV-J were determined by real-time PCR.
11540,The expression stability of these genes were analyzed and ranked using the geNorm tool.
11541,"Analysis indicated that the genes RPL30 (ribosomal protein L30) and SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A) were the most stably expressed genes in the ALV-J infected CEF."
11542,"CONCLUSIONS: The RPL30 and SDHA were deemed suitable for use as reference genes for real-time PCR analysis of mRNA gene expression during ALV-J infection, whereas commonly used ACTB and GAPDH are unsuitable to be reference genes."
11543,Infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory illness and has a high mortality rate (~35%).
11544,The requirement for the virus to be manipulated in a biosafety level three (BSL-3) facility has impeded development of urgently-needed antiviral agents.
11545,"Here, we established anovel mouse model by inserting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) into the Rosa26 locus using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in global expression of the transgene in a genetically stable mouse line."
11546,"The mice were highly susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV clinical strain hCoV-EMC, which induced severe diffuse pulmonary disease in the animals, and could also be infected by an optimized pseudotyped MERS-CoV."
11547,"Administration of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, H111-1 and m336, as well as a fusion inhibitor peptide, HR2P-M2, protected mice from challenge with authentic and pseudotyped MERS-CoV."
11548,"These results confirmed that the hDPP4-knockin mouse is a novel model for studies of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and anti-MERS-CoV antiviral agents in BSL-3 and BSL-2facilities, respectively."
11549,: Recent studies have clearly demonstrated the enormous virus diversity that exists among wild animals.
11550,"This exemplifies the required expansion of our knowledge of the virus diversity present in wildlife, as well as the potential transmission of these viruses to domestic animals or humans."
11551,METHODS: In the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples (n = 42) collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting the northern part of Spain using random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing.
11552,"Samples were collected from American mink (Neovison vison), European mink (Mustela lutreola), European polecat (Mustela putorius), European pine marten (Martes martes), stone marten (Martes foina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles) of the family of Mustelidae; common genet (Genetta genetta) of the family of Viverridae; red fox (Vulpes vulpes) of the family of Canidae and European wild cat (Felis silvestris) of the family of Felidae."
11553,"RESULTS: A number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a kobuvirus and picobirnaviruses."
11554,"CONCLUSIONS: Using random PCR in combination with next generation sequencing, sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in fecal samples collected from Spanish carnivores."
11555,Detected novel viruses highlight the viral diversity that is present in fecal material of wild carnivores.

11557,"(2011) Report of the ‘Mechanisms of lung injury and immunomodulator interventions in influenza’ workshop, 21 March 2010, Ventura, California, USA*."
11558,"Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), 453–e475."
11559,"The clinical course of influenza and the extent of lung injury are determined by both viral and host factors, as well as sometimes secondary bacterial infections and exacerbations of underlying conditions."
11560,"The balance between viral replication and the host immune responses is central to disease pathogenesis, and the extent of lung injury in severe influenza infections may be due in part to overly exuberant or dysregulated innate inflammatory responses or sometimes deficient responses."
11561,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the principal cause of respiratory failure associated with severe influenza.
11562,ARDS can be triggered by both direct lung insults (e.g.
11563,respiratory pathogens) and systemic insults (e.g.
11564,"sepsis), and the lung damage is exacerbated by the inflammatory response associated with either infectious or non‐infectious insults."
11565,This workshop aimed to review the current understanding of lung injury in acute influenza and describe cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung injury that are common to influenza and infections by other respiratory pathogens.
11566,"In addition, therapeutic agents that target host response proteins and pathways were identified and investigational agents in development reviewed."
11567,A logical strategy would be to combine antiviral treatment with drugs that modify excessive host responses or supplement deficient ones.
11568,"However, a better understanding of common cell signalling pathways associated with acute lung injury caused by influenza and other pathogens is necessary to understand immunopathologic causes of lung injury."
11569,"This will help determine which immunomodulatory interventions might be useful, and to predict the appropriate timing and consequences of their use."
11570,Infection and Multiple Sclerosis
11571, Five conventionally kept calves aged between 17 and 24 days were experimentally infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) by aerosol in order to mimic the natural infection route.
11572,The calves were killed and autopsies performed 7 days after the first virus challenge.
11573,"The BRSV isolate used induced tracheitis, bronchitis and atelectasis in infected calves."
11574,The only virus which could be isolated from the lungs of the calves was BRSV.
11575,"In addition, Mycoplasma bovirhinis was isolated from the lung or/and trachea of two calves."
11576,"The clinical and histopathological findings, as well as the detection of BRSV antigens by immunofluorescence in the epithelial cells of lung and trachea, and the reisolation of the virus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of all inoculated calves, provided confirmation of successful infection with BRSV."
11577,Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an emerging orthobunyavirus of ruminants associated with outbreaks of congenital malformations in aborted and stillborn animals.
11578,"Since its discovery in November 2011, SBV has spread very rapidly to many European countries."
11579,"Here, we developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions."
11580,"Using a synthetic biology approach, we developed a reverse genetics system for the rapid rescue and genetic manipulation of SBV."
11581,We showed that SBV has a wide tropism in cell culture and “synthetic” SBV replicates in vitro as efficiently as wild type virus.
11582,We developed an experimental mouse model to study SBV infection and showed that this virus replicates abundantly in neurons where it causes cerebral malacia and vacuolation of the cerebral cortex.
11583,"These virus-induced acute lesions are useful in understanding the progression from vacuolation to porencephaly and extensive tissue destruction, often observed in aborted lambs and calves in naturally occurring Schmallenberg cases."
11584,"Indeed, we detected high levels of SBV antigens in the neurons of the gray matter of brain and spinal cord of naturally affected lambs and calves, suggesting that muscular hypoplasia observed in SBV-infected lambs is mostly secondary to central nervous system damage."
11585,"Finally, we investigated the molecular determinants of SBV virulence."
11586,"Interestingly, we found a biological SBV clone that after passage in cell culture displays increased virulence in mice."
11587,We also found that a SBV deletion mutant of the non-structural NSs protein (SBVΔNSs) is less virulent in mice than wild type SBV.
11588,Attenuation of SBV virulence depends on the inability of SBVΔNSs to block IFN synthesis in virus infected cells.
11589,"In conclusion, this work provides a useful experimental framework to study the biology and pathogenesis of SBV."
11590,Influenza viruses are notorious pathogens that frequently cross the species barrier with often severe consequences for both animal and human health.
11591,"In 2011, a novel member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of swine."
11592,Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock.
11593,"To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans."
11594,The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures.
11595,"Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed higher replication kinetics compared to Influenza C virus, despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells."
11596,"Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock."
11597,Introduction: Emerging and reemerging viral infections represent a major concern for human and veterinary public health and there is an urgent need for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.
11598,Areas covered: A recent strategy in antiviral research is based on the identification of molecules targeting host functions required for infection of multiple viruses.
11599,A number of FDA-approved drugs used to treat several human diseases are cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) that have the ability to accumulate inside cells affecting several structures/functions hijacked by viruses during infection.
11600,In this review we summarized the CADs’ chemical properties and effects on the cells and reported the main FDA-approved CADs that have been identified so far as potential antivirals in drug repurposing studies.
11601,"Expert commentary: Although there have been concerns regarding the efficacy and the possible side effects of the off-label use of CADs as antivirals, they seem to represent a promising starting point for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies."
11602,Further knowledge about their mechanism of action is required to improve their antiviral activity and to reduce the risk of side effects.
11603,"The continued emergence and re-emergence of pathogens represent an ongoing, sometimes major, threat to populations."
11604,"Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) and their associated human diseases were considered to be confined to Eurasia, but the occurrence of an outbreak in 1993–94 in the southwestern United States led to a great increase in their study among virologists worldwide."
11605,"Well over 40 hantaviral genotypes have been described, the large majority since 1993, and nearly half of them pathogenic for humans."
11606,"Hantaviruses cause persistent infections in their reservoir hosts, and in the Americas, human disease is manifest as a cardiopulmonary compromise, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with case-fatality ratios, for the most common viral serotypes, between 30% and 40%."
11607,"Habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances, perhaps including climate change, are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present."
11608,"We consider here the features that influence the structure of host population dynamics that may lead to viral outbreaks, as well as the macromolecular determinants of hantaviruses that have been regarded as having potential contribution to pathogenicity."
11609,"Viruses exhibit rapid mutational capacity to trick and infect host cells, sometimes assisted through virus-coded peptides that counteract host cellular immune defense."
11610,"Although a large number of compounds have been identified as inhibiting various viral infections and disease progression, it is urgent to achieve the discovery of more effective agents."
11611,"Furthermore, proportionally to the great variety of diseases caused by viruses, very few viral vaccines are available, and not all are efficient."
11612,"Thus, new antiviral substances obtained from natural products have been prospected, including those derived from venomous animals."
11613,"Venoms are complex mixtures of hundreds of molecules, mostly peptides, that present a large array of biological activities and evolved to putatively target the biochemical machinery of different pathogens or host cellular structures."
11614,"In addition, non-venomous compounds, such as some body fluids of invertebrate organisms, exhibit antiviral activity."
11615,"This review provides a panorama of peptides described from animal venoms that present antiviral activity, thereby reinforcing them as important tools for the development of new therapeutic drugs."
11616,Influenza is often complicated by bacterial pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx and invade the middle ear and/or lung epithelium.
11617,Incidence and pathogenicity of influenza-bacterial coinfections are multifactorial processes that involve various pathogenic virulence factors and host responses with distinct site- and strain-specific differences.
11618,Animal models and kinetic models have improved our understanding of how influenza viruses interact with their bacterial co-pathogens and the accompanying immune responses.
11619,"Data from these models indicate that considerable alterations in epithelial surfaces and aberrant immune responses lead to severe inflammation, a key driver of bacterial acquisition and infection severity following influenza."
11620,"However, further experimental and analytical studies are essential to determining the full mechanistic spectrum of different viral and bacterial strains and species and to finding new ways to prevent and treat influenza-associated bacterial coinfections."
11621,"Here, we review recent advances regarding transmission and disease potential of influenza-associated bacterial infections and discuss the current gaps in knowledge."
11622, The effect of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on the survival of airborne bovine rotavirus UK isolate (BRV-UK) and a murine rotavirus (MRV) was studied.
11623,"In any one experiment, the virus under test was suspended in tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) supplemented with uranine (physical tracer) and an antifoam, was aerosolized using a Collison nebulizer into the rotating drum with the RH at either low (30 ± 5%), medium (50 + 5%) or high (80 ± 5%) level at 20 ± 1°C."
11624,"Following a 15-min period of viral aerosol stabilization, sequential samples of drum air were collected using an All-Glass Impinger (AGI) for 24 h post-aerosolization."
11625,Both of the rotavirus isolates were found to survive best at medium RH level and high RH was found least favorable for the survival of these aerosolized rotaviruses.
11626,The survival pattern of aerosolized MRV was found to be the best when compared with survival pattern of all animal and human rotavirus isolates studies performed under aerosolized conditions in our laboratory.
11627,The findings of these experiments confirm and extend our previous reports on the survival of other animal and human aerosolized rotaviruses and emphasize the fact that air may be one of the vehicles for their dissemination and could explain why it is difficult to control nosocomial outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis and to keep animal colonies rotavirus-free.
11628,Dromedary camels are the natural reservoirs of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
11629,Camels are mostly bred in East African countries then exported into Africa and Middle East for consumption.
11630,"To understand the distribution of MERS-CoV among camels in North Africa and the Middle East, we conducted surveillance in Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq."
11631,We also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in Egypt and Jordan to elucidate MERS-CoV infection and transmission.
11632,"Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 4027 nasal swabs and 3267 serum samples were collected from all countries."
11633,"Real- time PCR revealed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia."
11634,Microneutralization assay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries.
11635,"Positive PCR samples were partially sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was built."
11636,The tree suggested that all sequences are of clade C and sequences from camels in Egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences.
11637,Longitudinal studies showed high seroprevalence in adult camels.
11638,These results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camels.
11639,A systematic active surveillance and longitudinal studies for MERS-CoV are needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease and dynamics of viral infection.
11640,"The bone marrow contains heterogeneous population of cells that are involved in the regeneration and repair of diseased organs, including the lungs."
11641,"In this study, we isolated and characterized progenitor epithelial cells from the bone marrow of 4- to 5-week old germ-free pigs."
11642,"Microscopically, the cultured cells showed epithelial-like morphology."
11643,"Phenotypically, these cells expressed the stem cell markers octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct4) and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), the alveolar stem cell marker Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp), and the epithelial cell markers pan-cytokeratin (Pan-K), cytokeratin-18 (K-18), and occludin."
11644,"When cultured in epithelial cell growth medium, the progenitor epithelial cells expressed type I and type II pneumocyte markers."
11645,"Next, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to influenza virus."
11646,Progenitor epithelial cells expressed sialic acid receptors utilized by avian and mammalian influenza viruses and were targets for influenza virus replication.
11647,"Additionally, differentiated type II but not type I pneumocytes supported the replication of influenza virus."
11648,Our data indicate that we have identified a unique population of progenitor epithelial cells in the bone marrow that might have airway reconstitution potential and may be a useful model for cell-based therapies for infectious and non-infectious lung diseases.
11649,"Several enveloped RNA viruses of the arenavirus, bunyavirus, filovirus and flavivirus families are associated with a syndrome known as viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF)."
11650,"VHF is characterized by fever, vascular leakage, coagulation defects and multi organ system failure."
11651,"VHF is currently viewed as a disease precipitated by viral suppression of innate immunity, which promotes systemic virus replication and excessive proinflammatory cytokine responses that trigger the manifestations of severe disease."
11652,"However, the mechanisms by which immune dysregulation contributes to disease remain poorly understood."
11653,"Infection of nonhuman primates closely recapitulates human VHF, notably Ebola and yellow fever, thereby providing excellent models to better define the immunological basis for this syndrome."
11654,Here we review the current state of our knowledge and suggest future directions that will better define the immunological mechanisms underlying VHF.
11655,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula."
11656,MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept.
11657,"This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment."
11658,"However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs."
11659,The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date.
11660,"These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges."
11661,"MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models."
11662,"Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied."
11663,Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons.
11664,"Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case."
11665,"Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected."
11666,"Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future."
11667,The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor.
11668,"Overall, there are many unknown/confirmed aspects of the virus/human/animal network."
11669,"Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented."
11670,Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir/s are of high priority.
11671,"This will reduce the shedding of the virus into the environment, and thus the risk of human infection can be mitigated."
11672," Plasma therapy consists in bringing to a patient in need – in general suffering a severe, resistant to current therapy, and even lethal infection – plasma or specific, fractioned, antibodies, along with other immunoglobulins and possibly healing factors that can be obtained from immunized blood donors; donors (voluntary and benevolent) can be either actively immunized individuals or convalescent persons."
11673,"Plasma therapy has been used since the Spanish flu in 1917–1918, and regularly then when viral epidemics threatened vulnerable populations, the last reported occurrence being the 2013–2015 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa."
11674,"The precise action mechanism of plasma therapy is not fully delineated as it may function beyond purified, neutralizing antibodies."
11675," The last decade has witnessed the emergence of several new viral infectious agents, most notably avian influenza H5N1, SARS and West Nile Virus."
11676,"The emergence of these agents is heavily associated with zonotic animal hosts, as well as migratory pathways of infected bird vectors."
11677,The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases.
11678,Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence.
11679,"We suggest that Cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia, could be a) a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and, b) a source of zoonoses through infection of the ‘target’ animal (including humans)."
11680,"One example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsRNA from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts, as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsRNA viral-like particles."
11681,The importance of such a surrogate relationship is discussed and its implications for human and animal health highlighted.
11682,The interferon system as a basis for antiviral therapy or prophylaxis
11683,"In 2012, a novel human coronavirus emerged and was tentatively named “Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus” (MERS-CoV)."
11684,The high mortality rate of MERS-CoV focused attention on the ecology of the virus.
11685,It has been found that MERS-CoV belongs to the group C lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus.
11686,"Coronavirus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus, and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike (S1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins of MERS-CoV have revealed that it is related to bat viruses."
11687,"Recently, the MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies were detected in dromedary camels."
11688,"Despite the limited number of reported cases of person-to-person transmission, the rapid evolution of the virus poses a continuous threat to humans worldwide."
11689,"This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the virology, clinical spectrum, evolution, diagnosis and treatment of MERS-CoV infections."
11690,"Despite consistent efforts to protect public health there is still a heavy burden of viral disease, both in the United States and abroad."
11691,"In addition to conventional medical treatment, there is a need for a holistic approach for early detection and prevention of viral outbreaks at a population level."
11692,One-Health is a relatively new integrative approach to the solving of global health challenges.
11693,"A key component to the One-Health approach is the notion that human health, animal health, and environmental health are all innately interrelated."
11694,"One-Health interventions, initiated by veterinary doctors, have proven to be effective in controlling outbreaks, but thus far the applications focus on zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans."
11695,"Environmental engineers and environmental scientists hold a critical role in the further development of One-Health approaches that include water-related transport and transmission of human, animal, and zoonotic viruses."
11696,"In addition to waterborne viruses, the proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of viruses that are found in human excrement since contaminated water-based surveillance systems may be used for early detection of viral disease."
11697,This paper proposes a greater One-Health based framework that involves water-related pathways.
11698,The first step in the proposed framework is the identification of critical exposure pathways of viruses in the water environment.
11699,"Identification of critical pathways informs the second and third steps, which include water-based surveillance systems for early detection at a population level and implementation of intervention approaches to block the critical pathways of exposure."
11700,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes respiratory infection in humans, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia."
11701,"In dromedary camels, the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals."
11702,"Differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals, as well as between humans and dromedary camels, highlight the role of host factors in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission."
11703,"One of these host factors, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), may be a critical determinant because it is variably expressed in MERS-CoV-susceptible species as well as in humans."
11704,"This could partially explain inter- and intraspecies differences in the tropism, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of MERS-CoV."
11705,"In this review, we explore the role of DPP4 and other host factors in MERS-CoV transmission and pathogenesis—such as sialic acids, host proteases, and interferons."
11706,Further characterization of these host determinants may potentially offer novel insights to develop intervention strategies to tackle ongoing outbreaks.
11707,Flaviviruses continue to cause globally relevant epidemics and have emerged or re-emerged in regions that were previously unaffected.
11708,Factors determining emergence of flaviviruses and continuing circulation in sylvatic cycles are incompletely understood.
11709,Here we identify potential sylvatic reservoirs of flaviviruses and characterize the macro-ecological traits common to known wildlife hosts to predict the risk of sylvatic flavivirus transmission among wildlife and identify regions that could be vulnerable to outbreaks.
11710,We evaluate variability in wildlife hosts for zoonotic flaviviruses and find that flaviviruses group together in distinct clusters with similar hosts.
11711,Models incorporating ecological and climatic variables as well as life history traits shared by flaviviruses predict new host species with similar host characteristics.
11712,The combination of vector distribution data with models for flavivirus hosts allows for prediction of global vulnerability to flaviviruses and provides potential targets for disease surveillance in animals and humans.
11713," Ge Gen Decoction (GGD), a Traditional Chinese Medicine prescription, is mainly used to treat infectious respiratory diseases and can relieve the symptoms of influenza A virus (IAV) infection."
11714,"However, the underlying mechanism of GGD against IAV infection remains unclear."
11715,"In this study, we found that GGD had moderate anti-IAV activity in vitro."
11716,GGD was more effective when given before the viral infection and targeted the viral attachment and replication stages rather than the internalization stage.
11717,"In vivo, GGD treatment reduced thevirus titers of lung tissue significantly and improved the survival rate, lung index, and pulmonary histopathological changes in H1N1-infected mice."
11718,We observed the changes in several key immuno-related indexes in GGD administrated H1N1-infected mice with anti-IAV drug oseltamivir phosphate as the control.
11719,GGD treatment decreased the expression of TNF-α and improved Th1/Th2 immune balance to reduce the excessive immune response in H1N1-infected mice.
11720,"Besides, the expression of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway in H1N1-infected mice decreased after GGD treatment."
11721,Our results showed that GGD has anti-IAV activity and can modulate the immune system to relieve lung inflammation.
11722,Background: The importance of aerosols in the spread of viruses like influenza is still a subject of debate.
11723,"Indeed, most viruses can also be transmitted through direct contact and droplets."
11724,"Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine."
11725,The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets.
11726,"Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed."
11727,The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naïve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only.
11728,A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers.
11729,The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus.
11730,Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-µm and an 8-µm aerodynamic diameter.
11731,"In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments."
11732,Paramyxoviruses comprise a large number of diverse viruses which in part give rise to severe diseases in affected hosts.
11733,"A new genotype of feline morbillivirus, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2), was isolated from urine of cats with urinary tract diseases."
11734,Whole genome sequencing showed about 78% nucleotide homology to known feline morbilliviruses.
11735,The virus was isolated in permanent cell lines of feline and simian origin.
11736,"To investigate the cell tropism of FeMV-GT2 feline primary epithelial cells from the kidney, the urinary bladder and the lung, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as organotypic brain slice cultures were used for infection experiments."
11737,"We demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 is able to infect renal and pulmonary epithelial cells, primary cells from the cerebrum and cerebellum, as well as immune cells in the blood, especially CD4(+) T cells, CD20(+) B cells and monocytes."
11738,The cats used for virus isolation shed FeMV-GT2 continuously for several months despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the blood.
11739,Our results point towards the necessity of increased awareness for this virus when clinical signs of the aforementioned organs are encountered in cats which cannot be explained by other etiologies.
11740,A novel betacoronavirus associated with lethal respiratory and renal complications was recently identified in patients from several countries in the Middle East.
11741,We report the deep genome sequencing of the virus directly from a patient’s sputum sample.
11742,Our high-throughput sequencing yielded a substantial depth of genome sequence assembly and showed the minority viral variants in the specimen.
11743,Detailed phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome (England/Qatar/2012) revealed its close relationship to European bat coronaviruses circulating among the bat species of the Vespertilionidae family.
11744,"Molecular clock analysis showed that the 2 human infections of this betacoronavirus in June 2012 (EMC/2012) and September 2012 (England/Qatar/2012) share a common virus ancestor most likely considerably before early 2012, suggesting the human diversity is the result of multiple zoonotic events."
11745,Henipaviruses are zoonotic viruses that can cause severe and acute respiratory diseases and encephalitis in humans.
11746,"To date, no vaccine or treatments are approved for human use."
11747,The presence of neutralizing antibodies is a strong correlate of protection against lethal disease in animals.
11748,"However, since RNA viruses are prone to high mutation rates, the possibility that these viruses will escape neutralization remains a potential concern."
11749,"In the present study, we generated neutralization-escape mutants, using 6 different monoclonal antibodies, and studied the effect of these neutralization-escape mutations on in vitro and in vivo fitness."
11750,These data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of cocktails of cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize residues within the glycoprotein that are important for virus replication and virulence.
11751,"The influenza B virus encodes a unique protein, NB, a membrane protein whose function in the replication cycle is not, as yet, understood."
11752,"We engineered a recombinant influenza B virus lacking NB expression, with no concomitant difference in expression or activity of viral neuraminidase (NA) protein, an important caveat since NA is encoded on the same segment and initiated from a start codon just 4 nt downstream of NB."
11753,Replication of the virus lacking NB was not different to wild-type virus with full-length NB in clonal immortalized or complex primary cell cultures.
11754,"In the mouse model, virus lacking NB induced slightly lower IFN-α levels in infected lungs, but this did not affect virus titres or weight loss."
11755,"In ferrets infected with a mixture of viruses that did or did not express NB, there was no fitness advantage for the virus that retained NB."
11756,"Moreover, virus lacking NB protein was transmitted following respiratory droplet exposure of sentinel animals."
11757,These data suggest no role for NB in supporting replication or transmission in vivo in this animal model.
11758,The role of NB and the nature of selection to retain it in all natural influenza B viruses remain unclear.
11759," Feline morbillivirus (FeMV), a novel virus from the family of Paramyxoviridae, was first identified in stray cat populations."
11760,The objectives of the current study were to (i) determine the molecular prevalence of FeMV in Malaysia; (ii) identify risk factors associated with FeMV infection; and (iii) characterise any FeMV isolates by phylogenetic analyses.
11761,"Molecular analysis utilising nested RT-PCR assay targeting the L gene of FeMV performed on either urine, blood and/or kidney samples collected from 208 cats in this study revealed 82 (39.4%) positive cats."
11762,FeMV-positive samples were obtained from 63/124 (50.8%) urine and 20/25 (80.0%) kidneys while all blood samples were negative for FeMV.
11763,"In addition, from the 35 cats that had more than one type of samples collected (blood and urine; blood and kidney; blood, urine and kidney), only one cat had FeMV RNA in the urine and kidney samples."
11764,"Risk factors such as gender, presence of kidney-associated symptoms and cat source were also investigated."
11765,Male cats had a higher risk (p = 0.031) of FeMV infection than females.
11766,"In addition, no significant association (p = 0.083) was observed between the presence of kidney-associated symptoms with FeMV status."
11767,"From the 82 positive samples, FeMV RNA was detected from 48/82 (58.5%) pet cats and 34/126 (27.0%) shelter cats (p < 0.0001)."
11768,Partial L and N gene sequencing of the RT-PCR-positive samples showed 85–99% identity to the published FeMV sequences and it was significantly different from all other morbilliviruses.
11769,"A phylogenetic analysis of the identified Malaysian FeMVs was performed with isolates from Japan, Thailand and China."
11770,"Molecular characterisation revealed high relatedness of the Malaysian isolates with other Asian FeMVs, indicating that the virus had been circulating only within the region."
11771,"Therefore, this study confirmed the existence of FeMV among domestic cats in Malaysia."
11772,"The findings suggest further characterisation of the local isolates, including the whole genome sequencing and that studies at determining the direct consequences of FeMV infection in domestic cats are needed."
11773,"In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of foodborne diseases worldwide, with viruses now being recognized as a major cause of these illnesses."
11774,"The most common viruses implicated in foodborne disease are enteric viruses, which are found in the human gastrointestinal tract, excreted in human feces and transmitted by the fecal-oral route."
11775,Many different viruses are found in the gastrointestinal tract but not all are recognized as foodborne pathogens.
11776,"The diseases caused by enteric viruses fall into three main types: gastroenteritis, enterically transmitted hepatitis, and illnesses that can affect other parts of the body such as the eye, the respiratory system and the central nervous system leading to conjunctivitis, poliomyelitis, meningitis and encephalitis."
11777,"Viral pathogens excreted in human feces include noroviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), rotaviruses, and astroviruses."
11778,Most of these viruses have been associated with foodborne disease outbreaks.
11779,"Noroviruses and HAV are commonly identified as foodborne causes of gastroenteritis and acute hepatitis, respectively."
11780,: Quantitative microbiological risk assessment has hitherto been predominantly used for risks from exposure to bacteria.
11781,"This chapter examines the requirements for full quantitative risk assessments for food- and waterborne viruses, and the interpretation and extrapolation of risk assessment outcomes."
11782,Future trends in quantitative risk assessment research for viruses are considered.
11783,"The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches."
11784,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders."
11785,"Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation."
11786,"Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed."
11787,"In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases."
11788,"We also review the application of recently developed human mAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases."
11789,The pattern of tissue tropism for several prototype and uncharacterized strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was studied by intranasal inoculation of each virus strain into groups of neonatal Swiss mice under otherwise identical conditions.
11790,"Mice were killed at intervals up to 18 days after inoculation, and their tissues were examined for the presence of MHV antigen by indirect immunofluorescence."
11791,Two patterns of infection were apparent.
11792,"Prototype MHV strains 1, 3, A59, JHM, S and uncharacterized MHV strains Tettnang and wt-1 produced a respiratory pattern, in which nose and lung were consistently involved with dissemination to other organs in a vascular distribution."
11793,"Pulmonary vascular endothelium and alveolar septal cells, but not airway epithelium, were infected."
11794,"An enteric pattern was observed with MHV-Y and wt-2 in which MHV antigen was largely restricted to the nose and bowel, with limited dissemination to other abdominal organs but not lung."
11795,Intestinal lesions in these mice were severe compared to those manifesting the respiratory pattern of infection.
11796,"These results indicate that, like coronaviruses of other species, different strains of MHV possess different primary and secondary organotropisms following a natural route of inoculation in a susceptible host."
11797,"The complete genome sequence was determined for avian paramyxovirus (APMV-6) serotype 6 strain teal/Chany/455/2009, isolated from a teal (Anas crecca) in Siberia."
11798,Siberia is crossed by four major migration flyways and represents the major breeding area for many wild bird species in the Palearctic.
11799,Strain teal/Chany/455/2009 is genetically closely related to Kazakh and Chinese strains and belongs to the genetic group of duck/Hong Kong/18/199/77-like APMV-6 viruses.
11800,We show that the virus has low pathogenic potential according to genetic markers and animal model experiments.
11801, Picornaviruses are among the best understood animal viruses in molecular terms.
11802,A number of important human and animal pathogens are members of the Picornaviridae family.
11803,"The genome organization, the different steps of picornavirus growth and numerous compounds that have been reported as inhibitors of picornavirus functions are reviewed."
11804,"The picornavirus particles and several agents that interact with them have been solved at atomic resolution, leading to computer-assisted drug design."
11805,Picornavirus inhibitors are useful in aiding a better understanding of picornavirus biology.
11806,"In addition, some of them are promising therapeutic agents."
11807,Clinical efficacy of agents that bind to picornavirus particles has already been demonstrated.
11808,"Background: West Nile virus (WNV) molecular detection is being conducted by a growing number of laboratories, but the degree of proficiency may vary between them."
11809,External quality control is needed.
11810,Methods: We have conducted an international quality assurance study on WNV molecular detection.
11811,Participating laboratories tested noninfectious samples inactivated by heat and gamma irradiation.
11812,"Participants received 7 coded lyophilized samples containing WNV of genetic lineages 1a, 1b, and 2 at 2600 to 18 000 000 RNA copies/mL, 3 samples containing heterologous flaviviruses, and 2 negative samples."
11813,Results: Thirty laboratories participated.
11814,The average laboratory achieved 50% detection probability from 7762 copies/mL onward (probit analysis; 95% CI = 1174–24547 copies/mL).
11815,"Lineages 1a and 1b were detected with equal efficiencies, but the lineage 2 strain (Ug37) was detected at significantly lower rates."
11816,Only 27% of participants were able to detect the 6 samples containing ≥1.8 × 10(4) copies/mL.
11817,Three laboratories generated false-positive results in negative samples.
11818,Six of 30 laboratories reported correct strain identification in 3 samples containing non-WNV flaviviruses.
11819,We observed a significant positive correlation between the capability of detecting non-WNV flaviviruses and detecting WNV lineage 2.
11820,"Conclusions: Most participants showed good performance in detecting lineage 1 WNV, the predominant virus in the Northern Hemisphere."
11821,The inability of some laboratories to detect even highly concentrated lineage 2 WNV downgraded the overall outcome.
11822,The lineage 2 material received through this study will provide laboratories with the necessary template for improving their assays.
11823,Such material is otherwise hard to obtain.
11824, Mouse models are important tools both for studying the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and for the preclinical evaluation of vaccines and therapies against a wide variety of human pathogens.
11825,"The use of genetically defined inbred mouse strains, humanized mice, and gene knockout mice has allowed the research community to explore how pathogens cause disease, define the role of specific host genes in either controlling or promoting disease, and identify potential targets for the prevention or treatment of a wide range of infectious agents."
11826,"This review discusses several of the most commonly used mouse model systems, as well as new resources such as the Collaborative Cross as models for studying infectious diseases."
11827, Background Viral myocarditis (VMC) treatment has long been lacking of effective methods.
11828,Our former studies indicated roles of calpain in VMC pathogenesis.
11829,This study aimed at verifying the potential of calpain in Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis treatment.
11830,"Methods A transgenic mouse overexpressing the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, was introduced in the study."
11831,VMC mouse model was established via intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 in transgenic and wild mouse respectively.
11832,Myocardial injury was assayed histologically (HE staining and pathology grading) and serologically (myocardial damage markers of CK-MB and cTnI).
11833,CVB3 replication was observed in vivo and in vitro via the capsid protein VP1 detection or virus titration.
11834,"Inflammation/fibrotic factors of MPO, perforin, IFNγ, IL17, Smad3 and MMP2 were evaluated using western blot or immunohistology stain."
11835,Role of calpain in regulating fibroblast migration was studied in scratch assays.
11836,Results Calpastatin overexpression ameliorated myocardial injury induced by CVB3 infection significantly in transgenic mouse indicated by reduced peripheral CK-MB and cTnI levels and improved histology injury.
11837,"Comparing with CVB3-infected wild type mouse, the transgenic mouse heart tissue carried lower virus load."
11838,"The inflammation factors of MPO, perforin, IFNγ and IL17 were down-regulated accompanied with fibrotic agents of Smad3 and MMP2 inhibition."
11839,"And calpain participated in the migration of fibroblasts in vitro, which further proves its role in regulating fibrosis."
11840,Conclusion Calpain plays dual roles of facilitating CVB3 replication and inflammation promotion.
11841,Calpain inhibition in CVB3-induced myocarditis showed significant treatment effect.
11842,Calpain might be a novel target for VMC treatment in clinical practices.
11843,"Newly emerged influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in Norwegian pigs, although often observed in a subclinical form, can lower the pig's growth performance by reducing feed efficiency in terms of a poorer feed conversion ratio."
11844,Infected pigs would consume more feed and require protracted production time to reach market weight.
11845,"In our observational longitudinal study, growth performance data from 728 control pigs and 193 infected pigs with known viral shedding time points were analyzed using mixed linear regression models to give estimates of the marginal effects of infection."
11846,Gaussian curves describing the variability of the estimates at the individual pig level formed the fundamental inputs to our stochastic models.
11847,The models were constructed to simulate the summed negative effects of the infection at the batch level of 150 fattening pigs growing from 33 to 100 kg.
11848,"Other inputs of variability and uncertainty were 1) batch transmission points, 2) pig infection points to reflect the disease transmission dynamics of the virus, and 3) final prevalence of infected pigs in the batch."
11849,"Monte Carlo random sampling gave 5,000 estimates on the outputs of the marginal effects for each pig."
11850,These results were summed up to provide estimates for a batch size of 150 pigs.
11851,"This figure was adjusted by our final prevalence distribution function, which was also derived from the longitudinal study with 12 cohorts of infected pigs."
11852,"For a 150-fattening-pig herd randomly selected from the population, the marginal effects of the infection were 1) 835 kg (fifth percentile) to 1,350 kg (95th percentile) increased feed intake and 2) 194 (fifth percentile) to 334 (95th percentile) pig days in excess of expected figures for an uninfected batch."
11853,A batch infected during growth phase 3 (81 to 100 kg BW) gave the worst results since the longitudinal study showed that a pig infected during growth phase 3 required more feed and a greater protracted production time compared to younger infected pigs.
11854,Sensitivity analysis showed that final prevalence had the greatest impact on the conditional mean and variation of the marginal effects of infections.
11855,Batch transmission point was the next most influential factor.
11856,Lowering the final prevalence and preventing older fattening pigs from being infected will have the greatest benefit in saving feed cost and reducing delay in getting the pigs to the market.
11857,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like WIV1-coronavirus (CoV) was first isolated from Rhinolophus sinicus bats and can use the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
11858,"In the current study, we investigate the ability of WIV1-CoV to infect Rousettus aegyptiacus bats."
11859,No clinical signs were observed throughout the experiment.
11860,"Furthermore, only four oropharyngeal swabs and two respiratory tissues, isolated on day 3 post inoculation, were found positive for viral RNA."
11861,Two out of twelve bats showed a modest increase in coronavirus specific antibodies post challenge.
11862,"In conclusion, WIV1-CoV was unable to cause a robust infection in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats."
11863," Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-coded glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE were employed in an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness using sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells."
11864,The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively.
11865,The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model.
11866,One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains.
11867,"One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant."
11868,"Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection."
11869,The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762.
11870,"Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively."
11871,"The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice."
11872,We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain.
11873,Animal viruses frequently cause zoonotic disease in humans.
11874,"As these viruses are highly diverse, evaluating the threat that they pose remains a major challenge, and efficient approaches are needed to rapidly predict virus-host compatibility."
11875,"Here, we develop a combined computational and experimental approach to assess the compatibility of New World arenaviruses, endemic in rodents, with the host TfR1 entry receptors of different potential new host species."
11876,"Using signatures of positive selection, we identify a small motif on rodent TfR1 that conveys species specificity to the entry of viruses into cells."
11877,"However, we show that mutations in this region affect the entry of each arenavirus differently."
11878,"For example, a human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this region, L212V, makes human TfR1 a weaker receptor for one arenavirus, Machupo virus, but a stronger receptor for two other arenaviruses, Junin and Sabia viruses."
11879,"Collectively, these findings set the stage for potential evolutionary trade-offs, where natural selection for resistance to one virus may make humans or rodents susceptible to other arenavirus species."
11880,"Given the complexity of this host-virus interplay, we propose a computational method to predict these interactions, based on homology modeling and computational docking of the virus-receptor protein-protein interaction."
11881,"We demonstrate the utility of this model for Machupo virus, for which a suitable cocrystal structural template exists."
11882,Our model effectively predicts whether the TfR1 receptors of different species will be functional receptors for Machupo virus entry.
11883,Approaches such at this could provide a first step toward computationally predicting the “host jumping” potential of a virus into a new host species.
11884,"IMPORTANCE We demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs may exist in the dynamic evolutionary interplay between viruses and their hosts, where natural selection for resistance to one virus could make humans or rodents susceptible to other virus species."
11885,"We present an algorithm that predicts which species have cell surface receptors that make them susceptible to Machupo virus, based on computational docking of protein structures."
11886,Few molecular models exist for predicting the risk of spillover of a particular animal virus into humans or new animal populations.
11887,"Our results suggest that a combination of evolutionary analysis, structural modeling, and experimental verification may provide an efficient approach for screening and assessing the potential spillover risks of viruses circulating in animal populations."
11888,"Since May 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea have devastated the U.S. swine industry, causing immense economic losses."
11889,Two different swine enteric coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Delta coronavirus) have been isolated from the affected swine population.
11890,"The disease has been reported from at least 32 states of the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, and Ukraine, with repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds."
11891,Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from diarrheic feces of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal from multiple sources.
11892,MRV3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states.
11893,Several MRV3 isolates were obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or developing chicken embryos.
11894,Biological characterization of two representative isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90°C.
11895,NextGen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the S1 segment to mammalian and bat MRV3.
11896,Neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection.
11897,"Therefore, the novel porcine MRV3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine enteric viruses."
11898,"The role of MRV3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in the United States remains to be determined, but the pathogenic nature of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence."
11899,: Inflammatory process results in lung injury that may lead to pulmonary fibrosis (PF).
11900,"Here, we described PF in mice infected with H5N1 virus."
11901,METHODS: Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 × 10(1 )MID(50 )of A/Chicken/Hebei/108/2002(H5N1) viruses.
11902,"Lung injury/fibrosis was evaluated by observation of hydroxyproline concentrations, lung indexes, and histopathology on days 7, 14, and 30 postinoculation."
11903,RESULTS: H5N1-inoculated mice presented two stages of pulmonary disease over a 30-d period after infection.
11904,"At acute stage, infected-mice showed typical diffuse pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema and hemorrhage on day 7 postinoculation."
11905,"At restoration stage, most infected-mice developed PF of different severities on day 30 postinoculation, and 18% of the survived mice underwent severe interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis with thickened alveolar walls, collapsed alveoli and large fibrotic areas."
11906,"The dramatically elevated hydroxyproline levels in H5N1-infected mice showed deposition of collagen in lungs, and confirmed fibrosis of lungs."
11907,"The dry lung-to-body weight ratio was significantly increased in infected group, which might be associated with the formation of PF in H5N1-infected mice."
11908,"CONCLUSION: Our findings show that H5N1-infected mice develop the typical PF during restoration period, which will contribute to the investigation of fibrogenesis and potential therapeutic intervention in human H5N1 disease."
11909,Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health.
11910,"In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use."
11911,"This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host."
11912,"In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species."
11913,Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems.
11914,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
11915,A rabbit model for coronavirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is described.
11916,Acute rabbit coronavirus infection results in virus-induced myocarditis and congestive heart failure.
11917,"Of the survivors of rabbit coronavirus infection, 41% had increased heart weight and heart weight-to-body weight ratios, biventricular dilation, myocyte hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and myocarditis consistent with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy."
11918,"These changes were also seen in the remaining 59% of the survivors, except that the degree of myocyte hypertrophy was reduced and only right ventricular dilation was present."
11919,"In most survivors, myocarditis was usually mild (1–5 foci/transverse section), but in some cases it was severe (>20 foci/transverse section)."
11920,Interstitial and replacement fibrosis was more pronounced in the papillary muscles.
11921,These data suggest that rabbit coronavirus infection may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy.
11922,"The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large predatory feline found widely in the Americas that is susceptible to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a fast-evolving lentivirus found in wild feline species that is analogous to simian immunodeficiency viruses in wild primates and belongs to the same family of viruses as human immunodeficiency virus."
11923,FIV infection in cougars can lead to a weakened immune system that creates opportunities for other infecting agents.
11924,"FIV prevalence and lineages have been studied previously in several areas in the western United States, but typically without spatially explicit statistical techniques."
11925,"To describe the distribution of FIV in a sample of cougars located in the northern Rocky Mountain region of North America, we first used kernel density ratio estimation to map the log relative risk of FIV."
11926,The risk surface showed a significant cluster of FIV in northwestern Montana.
11927,We also used Bayesian cluster models for genetic data to investigate the spatial structure of the feline immunodeficiency virus with virus genetic sequence data.
11928,A result of the models was two spatially distinct FIV lineages that aligned considerably with an interstate highway in Montana.
11929,Our results suggest that the use of spatial information and models adds novel insight when investigating an infectious animal disease.
11930,The results also suggest that the influence of landscape features likely plays an important role in the spatiotemporal spread of an infectious disease within wildlife populations.
11931, Liquid porcine plasma is an animal origin raw material for the manufacturing process of spray-dried porcine plasma that is used in pig nutrition worldwide.
11932,In previous studies we found that the application of ultraviolet light C (UV-C) in liquid plasma that was inoculated with a variety of bacteria or viruses of importance in the swine industry can be considered as redundant safety steps because in general achieve around 4 logs reduction for most of these pathogens.
11933,"However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model."
11934,"As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay."
11935,"We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot."
11936,"As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay."
11937,"Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals."
11938,Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age.
11939,Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS.
11940,Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum.
11941,"Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively."
11942,Group 2 pigs (0 J/L UV-C) got infection by PRRSV but no PCV-2 infection or seroconversion.
11943,"However, one pig from group 2 seroconverted to Rotavirus A (RVA) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and three group 2 pigs seroconverted to Porcine parvovirus (PPV)."
11944,"Groups 1, 3 and 4 pigs showed no evidence of infection or seroconversion associated with the tested viruses or any other pathogens found in the liquid plasma before UV-C irradiation."
11945,Group 5 pigs developed PCV-2 infectivity as expected.
11946,UV-C irradiation of liquid plasma at 3000 and 9000 J/L was effective in preventing PRRSV and other pathogens transmission.
11947,"Moreover, raw liquid plasma was non-infectious for PCV-2 in naïve pigs."
11948,Sars Coronavirus Accessory ORFs Encode Luxury Functions
11949, Wistar rats were inoculated subcutaneously with either type 1 (HSV1) or type 2 (HSV2) Herpes simplex virus at 5 days of age.
11950,Animals were killed in extremis or at the end of the 14-day observation period postinoculation.
11951,Acute destructive meningoencephalitis with hemorrhage and leukocytic infiltration was observed in both groups.
11952,Polycaryocytes comprised of cells of the internal granular layer of the cerebellum were observed in some animals inoculated with HSV1.
11953,"These multinucleated cells appeared to be formed by fusion of virus-infected cells, and intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed."
11954,Lesions in the leptomeninges were particularly striking in animals inoculated with HSV2.
11955,Viral replication in resident cells of the leptomeninges was demonstrated by electron microscopy.
11956,"As successive epidemics have swept the world, the scientific community has quickly learned from them about the emergence and transmission of communicable diseases."
11957,Epidemics usually occur when health systems are unprepared.
11958,"During an unexpected epidemic, health authorities engage in damage control, fear drives action, and the desire to understand the threat is greatest."
11959,"As humanity recovers, policy-makers seek scientific expertise to improve their “preparedness” to face future events."
11960,"Global spread of disease is exemplified by the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, by the spread of dengue fever through transcontinental migration of mosquitos, by the relentless influenza virus pandemics, and, most recently, by the unexpected emergence of Ebola virus, spread by motorbike and long haul carriers."
11961,"Other pathogens that are remarkable for their epidemic expansions include the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus diseases carried by rodents over great geographic distances and the arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya and Zika) enabled by ecology and vector adaptations."
11962,Did we learn from the past epidemics?
11963,Are we prepared for the worst?
11964,The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global health infrastructure.
11965,"Besides acquiring treatments, vaccines, and other preventive medicine, bio-surveillance is critical to preventing disease emergence and to counteracting its spread."
11966,"So far, only the western hemisphere has a large and established monitoring system; however, diseases continue to emerge sporadically, in particular in Southeast Asia and South America, illuminating the imperfections of our surveillance."
11967,"Epidemics destabilize fragile governments, ravage the most vulnerable populations, and threaten the global community."
11968,"Pandemic risk calculations employ new technologies like computerized maintenance of geographical and historical datasets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Next Generation sequencing, and Metagenomics to trace the molecular changes in pathogens during their emergence, and mathematical models to assess risk."
11969,"Predictions help to pinpoint the hot spots of emergence, the populations at risk, and the pathogens under genetic evolution."
11970,"Preparedness anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the capacities of infrastructure, the sources of emergency funding, and finally, the international partnerships needed to manage a disaster before it occurs."
11971,"At present, the world is in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health disparities despite exponential population growth, political conflicts, migration, global trade, urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming."
11972,"For the sake of humanity, we must focus on developing the necessary capacities for health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response."
11973, The antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) had been shown to inhibit replication of seasonal human influenza A viruses.
11974,"Here, the effects of NAC on H9N2 swine influenza virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI) were investigated in mice."
11975,BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 107 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of A/swine/HeBei/012/2008/(H9N2) viruses with or without NAC treatments to induce ALI model.
11976,"The result showed that pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary edema, MPO activity, total cells, neutrophils, macrophages, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and CXCL-10 in BALF were attenuated by NAC."
11977,"Moreover, our data showed that NAC significantly inhibited the levels of TLR4 protein and TLR4 mRNA in the lungs."
11978,Pharmacological inhibitors of TLR4 (E5564) exerted similar effects like those determined for NAC in H9N2 swine influenza virus-infected mice.
11979,These results suggest that antioxidants like NAC represent a potential additional treatment option that could be considered in the case of an influenza A virus pandemic.
11980,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes life-threatening disease.
11981,Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is the receptor for cell binding and entry.
11982,"There is a need for small-animal models of MERS, but mice are not susceptible to MERS because murine dpp4 does not serve as a receptor."
11983,We developed transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4) under the control of the surfactant protein C promoter or cytokeratin 18 promoter that are susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV.
11984,"Notably, mice expressing hDPP4 with the cytokeratin 18 promoter developed progressive, uniformly fatal disease following intranasal inoculation."
11985,"High virus titers were present in lung and brain tissues 2 and 6 days after infection, respectively."
11986,"MERS-CoV–infected lungs revealed mononuclear cell infiltration, alveolar edema, and microvascular thrombosis, with airways generally unaffected."
11987,"Brain disease was observed, with the greatest involvement noted in the thalamus and brain stem."
11988,Animals immunized with a vaccine candidate were uniformly protected from lethal infection.
11989,These new mouse models of MERS-CoV should be useful for investigation of early disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.
11990,": Synthetic virology is an important multidisciplinary scientific field, with emerging applications in biotechnology and medicine, aiming at developing methods to generate and engineer synthetic viruses."
11991,"In particular, many of the RNA viruses, including among others the Dengue and Zika, are widespread pathogens of significant importance to human health."
11992,The ability to design and synthesize such viruses may contribute to exploring novel approaches for developing vaccines and virus based therapies.
11993,RESULTS: Here we develop a full multidisciplinary pipeline for generation and analysis of synthetic RNA viruses and specifically apply it to Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2).
11994,The major steps of the pipeline include comparative genomics of endogenous and synthetic viral strains.
11995,"Specifically, we show that although the synthetic DENV-2 viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, is similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype master strain."
11996,"Additionally, the highly variable positions, identified in the analyzed DENV-2 population, were found to overlap with less conserved homologous positions in Zika virus and other Dengue serotypes."
11997,These results may suggest that synthetic DENV-2 could enhance virulence if the correct sequence is selected.
11998,CONCLUSIONS: The approach reported in this study can be used to generate and analyze synthetic RNA viruses both on genotypic and on phenotypic level.
11999,It could be applied for understanding the functionality and the fitness effects of any set of mutations in viral RNA and for editing RNA viruses for various target applications.
12000,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12859-018-2132-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
12001,"Current treatment schemes for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) include broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and ribavirin."
12002,"We evaluated the susceptibility of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) to ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-α in vitro by use of cytopathic effect, plaque assay, and immunoblot analysis."
12003,Ribavirin did not inhibit viral growth at concentrations attainable in human serum.
12004,"In contrast, IFN-α showed an in vitro inhibitory effect starting at concentrations of 1000 IU/mL."
12005,"In conclusion, ribavirin alone is unlikely to be beneficial in the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS CoV infections."
12006,Clinical trials with IFN-α might be justified to determine a beneficial effect on the outcome of SARS.
12007,The central nervous system (CNS) is a major target of several important human and animal viral pathogens causing congenital infections.
12008,"However, despite the importance of neuropathological outcomes, for humans in particular, the pathogenesis, including mode of neuro-invasion, remains unresolved for most congenital virus infections."
12009,"Using a natural model of congenital infection with an RNA virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus in pregnant cattle, we sought to delineate the timing and mode of virus neuro-invasion of and spread within the brain of foetuses following experimental respiratory tract infection of the dams at day 75 of pregnancy, a time of maximal risk of tissue pathology without foetal death."
12010,Virus antigen was first detected in the foetal brains 14 days postinfection of dams and was initially restricted to amoeboid microglial cells in the periventricular germinal layer.
12011,The appearance of these cells was preceded by or concurrent with vasculopathy in the same region.
12012,"While the affected microvessels were negative for virus antigen, they expressed high levels of the type I interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 and eventually disappeared in parallel with the appearance of microcavitary lesions."
12013,"Subsequently, the virus spread to neurons and other glial cells."
12014,"Our findings suggest that the virus enters the CNS via infected microglial precursors, the amoeboid microglial cells, in a ‘Trojan horse’ mode of invasion and that the microcavitary lesions are associated with loss of periventricular microvasculature, perhaps as a consequence of high, unrestricted induction of interferon-regulated proteins."
12015,"  This chapter discusses some observations concerning the natural occurrence and structural organization of polycistronic animal virus mRNAs, and the mechanisms by which they may be translated to yield two or more unique polypeptide products."
12016,"In most polycistronic viral mRNAs, initiation of translation of both the 5’-proximal, upstream cistron and the internal, downstream cistron(s) likewise occurs at an AUG codon."
12017,"Animal viruses encoding polycistronic mRNAs in which translation-initiation occurs alternatively at one or more AUG initiation sites, include members of several virus families that utilize a variety of different replication strategies as parts of their life cycles."
12018,"They include: 1. viruses with DNA genomes and viruses with RNA genomes; 2. viruses with circular genomes and viruses with linear genomes; 3. viruses whose genomes are constituted by a single piece of nucleic acid, as well as viruses with segmented genomes; and 4. viruses that utilize the cell nucleus as the site for mRNA biogenesis, as well as viruses whose mRNA is synthesized in the cytoplasm."
12019,"Furthermore, many different biochemical mechanisms may exist in animal cells to permit the expression of functionally polycistronic viral mRNAs."

12023,Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available.
12024,"Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option."
12025,"Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers."
12026,"Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection."
12027,"As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells."
12028,"Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication."
12029,Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes.
12030,Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection.
12031,These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection.
12032,"As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses."
12033,Use of this FDA-approved drug could rapidly be deployed during future outbreaks.
12034,The mode of infection transmission has profound implications for effective containment by public health interventions.
12035,The mode of smallpox transmission was never conclusively established.
12036,"Although, “respiratory droplet” transmission was generally regarded as the primary mode of transmission, the relative importance of large ballistic droplets and fine particle aerosols that remain suspended in air for more than a few seconds was never resolved."
12037,"This review examines evidence from the history of variolation, data on mucosal infection collected in the last decades of smallpox transmission, aerosol measurements, animal models, reports of smallpox lung among healthcare workers, and the epidemiology of smallpox regarding the potential importance of fine particle aerosol mediated transmission."
12038,I introduce briefly the term anisotropic infection to describe the behavior of Variola major in which route of infection appears to have altered the severity of disease.
12039,"Camels are known carriers for many viral pathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
12040,"It is likely that there are additional, as yet unidentified viruses in camels with the potential to cause disease in humans."
12041,"In this study, we performed metagenomic sequencing analysis on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 108 MERS-CoV-positive dromedary camels from a live animal market in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates."
12042,"We obtained a total of 846.72 million high-quality reads from these nasopharyngeal swab samples, of which 2.88 million (0.34%) were related to viral sequences while 512.63 million (60.5%) and 50.87 million (6%) matched bacterial and eukaryotic sequences, respectively."
12043,"Among the viral reads, sequences related to mammalian viruses from 13 genera in 10 viral families were identified, including Coronaviridae, Nairoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Polyomaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, and Genomoviridae."
12044,Some viral sequences belong to known camel or human viruses and others are from potentially novel camel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to virus sequences in GenBank.
12045,A total of five potentially novel virus species or strains were identified.
12046,Co-infection of at least two recently identified camel coronaviruses was detected in 92.6% of the camels in the study.
12047,This study provides a comprehensive survey of viruses in the virome of upper respiratory samples in camels that have extensive contact with the human population.
12048," Background Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has, worldwide, caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths, with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia."
12049,"In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on MERS-CoV transmission, evolution, and origin."
12050,Methods Full genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples.
12051,"Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage."
12052,"Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done."
12053,Findings Three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh.
12054,Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse.
12055,Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein.
12056,The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.
12057,Interpretation We present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far.
12058,MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission.
12059,Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R0 values.
12060,"Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people."
12061,Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.

12063,"Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is strongly associated with several important diseases of cattle, such as bovine respiratory disease, diarrhoea and haemoragic lesions."
12064,"To date many subgenotypes have been reported for BVDV-1, currently ranging from subgenotype 1a to subgenotype 1u."
12065,"While BVDV-1 has a world-wide distribution, the subgenotypes have a more restricted geographical distribution."
12066,"As an example, BVDV-1 subgenotypes 1a and 1b are frequently detected in North America and Europe, while the subgenotype 1c is rarely detected."
12067,"In contrast, BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c is by far the most commonly reported in Australia."
12068,"Despite this, uneven distribution of the biological importance of the subgenotypes remains unclear."
12069,The aim of this study was to characterise the in vivo properties of five strains of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c in cattle infection studies.
12070,No overt respiratory signs were reported in any of the infected cattle regardless of strain.
12071,"Consistent with other subgenotypes, transient pyrexia and leukopenia were commonly identified, while thrombocytopenia was not."
12072,The quantity of virus detected in the nasal secretions of transiently infected animals suggested the likelihood of horizontal transmission was very low.
12073,Further studies are required to fully understand the variability and importance of the BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c.
12074, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans and in vitro models of the lung are needed to elucidate cellular targets and the consequences of viral infection.
12075,"The severe and sudden onset of symptoms, resulting in an atypical pneumonia with dry cough and persistent high fever in cases of severe acute respiratory virus brought to light the importance of coronaviruses as potentially lethal human pathogens and the identification of several zoonotic reservoirs has made the reemergence of new strains and future epidemics all the more possible."
12076,"In this chapter, we describe the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting airway to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in relevant in vitro systems."
12077,The first culture model is a human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu-3 that can be inoculated by viruses either as a non-polarized monolayer of cells or polarized cells with tight junctions and microvilli.
12078,"The second model system, derived from primary cells isolated from human airway epithelium and grown on Transwells, form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo."
12079,Experimental results using these lung epithelial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases SARS-CoV replicates to high titers in epithelial cells of the conducting airway.
12080,"The SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polarized Calu-3 cells and human airway epithelial cultures (HAE), indicating that hACE2 was accessible by SARS-CoV after lumenal airway delivery."
12081,"Furthermore, in HAE, hACE2 was exclusively localized to ciliated airway epithelial cells."
12082,"In support of the hACE2 localization data, the most productive route of inoculation and progeny virion egress in both polarized Calu-3 and ciliated cells of HAE was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lumen of the human lung."
12083,Preincubation of the apical surface of cultures with antisera directed against hACE2 reduced viral titers by two logs while antisera against DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR did not reduce viral replication levels suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for entry of SARS-CoV into the ciliated cells of HAE cultures.
12084,To assess infectivity in ciliated airway cultures derived from susceptible animal species we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF 7a/7b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulting in SARS-CoV GFP.
12085,"SARS-CoV GFP replicated to similar titers as wild type viruses in Vero E6, MA104, and CaCo2 cells."
12086,"In addition, SARS-CoV replication in airway epithelial cultures generated from Golden Syrian hamster tracheas reached similar titers to the human cultures by 72h post-infection."
12087,Efficient SARS-CoV infection of ciliated cell-types in HAE provides a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study characteristics of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.
12088," Infection of conventional mice with a mouse adapted (MA15) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) reproduces many aspects of human SARS such as pathological changes in lung, viremia, neutrophilia, and lethality."
12089,"However, established mouse cell lines highly susceptible to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection are not available."
12090,"In this work, efficiently transfectable mouse cell lines stably expressing the murine SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been generated."
12091,These cells yielded high SARS-CoV-MA15 titers and also served as excellent tools for plaque assays.
12092,"In addition, in these cell lines, SARS-CoV-MA15 induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-β, mimicking what has been observed in experimental animal models infected with SARS-CoV and SARS patients."
12093,These cell lines are valuable tools to perform in vitro studies in a mouse cell system that reflects the species used for in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-MA15 pathogenesis.
12094,Cellular entry of enveloped viruses is often dependent on attachment proteins expressed on the host cell surface.
12095,"Viral envelope proteins bind these receptors, and, in an incompletely understood process, facilitate fusion of the cellular and viral membranes so as to introduce the viral core into the cytoplasm."
12096,Only a small fraction of viral receptors have been identified so far.
12097,"Recently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."
12098,"The fusion protein gene of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was cloned and characterized, and shortly thereafter, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was shown to be its functional receptor."
12099,Identification of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV will likely contribute to the development of antivirals and vaccines.
12100,"It may also contribute to the development of additional animal models for studying SARS pathogenesis, and could help identify the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV."
12101,"Hepatitis C virus is considered a major public health problem, infecting 2%–3% of the human population."
12102,"Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma."
12103,"In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available."
12104,"Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection."
12105,"To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic."
12106,"In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development."
12107,"Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses)."
12108,Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models.
12109,"In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus."
12110,"Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen."
12111,"The threat of an influenza A virus pandemic stems from continual virus spillovers from reservoir species, a tiny fraction of which spark sustained transmission in humans."
12112,"To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human."
12113,"Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus."
12114,"The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures."
12115,"We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk."

12117,"Nipah virus, an enveloped ribonucleic acid virus, has been a major cause of encephalitis out-breaks with high mortality, primarily in the Indo-Bangladesh regions."
12118,"Except for the first outbreak in Malaysia-Singapore, which was related to contact with pigs and the outbreak in Philippines associated with horse slaughter, most other outbreaks have affected the Indo- Bangladesh regions."
12119,The Indo-Bangladesh outbreaks were associated with consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats and had a very high secondary attack rate.
12120,"The patient usually presents with fever, encephalitis and/or respiratory involvement with or without thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and transaminitis."
12121,Diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation and nucleic acid amplification in the acute phase or antibody detection during the convalescent phase.
12122,Treatment is mostly limited to supportive care and syndromic management of acute encephalitis syndrome.
12123,"Ribavirin, m102.4 monoclonal antibody and favipiravir are the only anti-virals with some activity against Nipah virus."
12124,"Standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipments are the cornerstone of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy."
12125,"With the recent outbreaks affecting newer geographical areas, there is a need for physicians to be aware of this disease and keep abreast of its current detection and management strategies."
12126,Sites of antigen presentation in T-cell mediated demyelinating diseases
12127,Data from EV-D68-infected patients demonstrate that pathological changes in the lower respiratory tract are principally characterized by severe respiratory illness in children and acute flaccid myelitis.
12128,"However, lack of a suitable animal model for EV-D68 infection has limited the study on the pathogenesis of this critical pathogen, and the development of a vaccine."
12129,Ferrets have been widely used to evaluate respiratory virus infections.
12130,"In the current study, we used EV-D68-infected ferrets as a potential animal to identify impersonal indices, involving clinical features and histopathological changes in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT and LRT)."
12131,The research results demonstrate that the EV-D68 virus leads to minimal clinical symptoms in ferrets.
12132,"According to the viral load detection in the feces, nasal, and respiratory tracts, the infection and shedding of EV-D68 in the ferret model was confirmed, and these results were supported by the EV-D68 VP1 immunofluorescence confocal imaging with α2,6-linked sialic acid (SA) in lung tissues."
12133,"Furthermore, we detected the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression level, which implied high expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-8, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-17a in the lungs."
12134,These data indicate that systemic observation of responses following infection with EV-D68 in ferrets could be used as a model for EV-D68 infection and pathogenesis.
12135," In order to gain entry into cells, diverse viruses, including Ebola virus, SARS-coronavirus and the emerging MERS-coronavirus, depend on activation of their envelope glycoproteins by host cell proteases."
12136,The respective enzymes are thus excellent targets for antiviral intervention.
12137,"In cell culture, activation of Ebola virus, as well as SARS- and MERS-coronavirus can be accomplished by the endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB)."
12138,"In addition, SARS- and MERS-coronavirus can use serine proteases localized at the cell surface, for their activation."
12139,"However, it is currently unclear which protease(s) facilitate viral spread in the infected host."
12140,"We report here that the cysteine protease inhibitor K11777, ((2S)-N-[(1E,3S)-1-(benzenesulfonyl)-5-phenylpent-1-en-3-yl]-2-{[(E)-4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl]amino}-3-phenylpropanamide) and closely-related vinylsulfones act as broad-spectrum antivirals by targeting cathepsin-mediated cell entry."
12141,"K11777 is already in advanced stages of development for a number of parasitic diseases, such as Chagas disease, and has proven to be safe and effective in a range of animal models."
12142,K11777 inhibition of SARS-CoV and Ebola virus entry was observed in the sub-nanomolar range.
12143,"In order to assess whether cysteine or serine proteases promote viral spread in the host, we compared the antiviral activity of an optimized K11777-derivative with that of camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and related serine proteases."
12144,"Employing a pathogenic animal model of SARS-CoV infection, we demonstrated that viral spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is driven by serine rather than cysteine proteases and can be effectively prevented by camostat."
12145,"Camostat has been clinically used to treat chronic pancreatitis, and thus represents an exciting potential therapeutic for respiratory coronavirus infections."
12146,"Our results indicate that camostat, or similar serine protease inhibitors, might be an effective option for treatment of SARS and potentially MERS, while vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors are excellent lead candidates for Ebola virus therapeutics."
12147,"Polymicrobial diseases involve two or more microorganisms that act synergistically, or in succession, to mediate complex disease processes."
12148,"Although polymicrobial diseases in animals and humans can be caused by similar organisms, these diseases are often also caused by organisms from different kingdoms, genera, species, strains, substrains and even by phenotypic variants of a single species."
12149,"Animal models are often required to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis, and to develop therapies and prevention regimes."
12150,"However, reproducing polymicrobial diseases of humans in animal hosts presents significant challenges."
12151,H9N2 avian influenza viruses have repeatedly caused infections in swine and humans in some countries.
12152,The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the pulmonary pathology caused by H9N2 viral infection in mice.
12153,Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 1 × 10(4) MID(50) of A/Chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2) virus.
12154,"Clinical signs, pathological changes and viral replication in lungs, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were observed at different time points after infection."
12155,A control group was infected intranasally with noninfectious allantoic fluid.
12156,"H9N2-infected mice exhibited severe respiratory syndrome, with a mortality rate of 60%."
12157,Gross observations showed that infected lungs were highly edematous.
12158,"Major histopathological changes in infected lungs included diffuse pneumonia and alveolar damage, with neutrophil-dominant inflammatory cellular infiltration, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and severe bronchiolitis/peribronchiolitis."
12159,"In addition, H9N2 viral infection resulted in severe progressive hypoxemia, lymphopenia, and a significant increase in neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in BALF."
12160,The features described above satisfy the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
12161,"Our data show that H9N2 viral infection resulted in ARDS in mice, and this may facilitate studies of the pathogenesis of future potential H9N2 disease in humans."
12162,Twenty-seven nanopeptides derived from the matrix (M) protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were screened for their ability to elicit a recall interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response from the splenocytes of BALB/c mice following DNA vaccination and a booster vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus rWR-PRRSV-M. We identified two peptides (amino acid residues K(93)FITSRCRL and F(57)GYMTFVHF) as CD8(+ )cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes.
12163,"These peptides elicited significant numbers of IFN-γ secreting cells, compared with other M nonapeptides and one irrelevant nonapeptide."
12164,"Bioinformatics analysis showed that the former is an H-2K(d)-restricted CTL epitope, and the latter is an H-2D(d)-restricted CTL epitope."
12165,"Multiple amino acid sequence alignment among different PRRSV M sequences submitted to GenBank indicated that these two CTL epitopes are strongly conserved, and they should therefore be considered for further research on the mechanisms of cellular immune responses to PRRSV."
12166,Many pandemics have been attributed to the ability of some RNA viruses to change their host range to include humans.
12167,"Here, we review the mechanisms of disease emergence that are related to the host-range specificity of selected mosquito-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses."
12168,"We discuss viruses of medical importance, including Venezuelan equine and Japanese encephalitis viruses, dengue viruses and West Nile viruses."
12169," Infection with virulent biotypes of feline coronavirus (FCoV) can result in the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a typically fatal immune mediated disease for which there is currently no effective antiviral treatment."
12170,In this study we demonstrate the ability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the replication of virulent FCoV strain FIPV WSU 79-1146 in an immortalised feline cell line.
12171,A panel of eight synthetic siRNAs targeting four different regions of the FCoV genome were tested for antiviral effects.
12172,"Efficacy was determined by qRT-PCR of intracellular viral genomic and messenger RNA, TCID50 infectivity assay of extracellular virus, and direct IFA for viral protein expression."
12173,All siRNAs demonstrated an inhibitory effect on viral replication in vitro.
12174,"The two most effective siRNAs, targeting the untranslated 5′ leader sequence (L2) and the nucleocapsid gene (N1), resulted in a >95% reduction in extracellular viral titre."
12175,Further characterisation of these two siRNAs demonstrated their efficacy when used at low concentrations and in cells challenged with high viral loads.
12176,Taken together these findings provide important information for the potential therapeutic application of RNAi in treating FIP.
12177,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused human respiratory infections with a high case fatality rate since 2012.
12178,"However, the mode of virus transmission is not well understood."
12179,The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection.
12180,"We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication."
12181,We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient.
12182,MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid.
12183,"In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation."
12184,"Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice."
12185,"Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole."
12186,"With the progression of the enteric infection, inflammation, virus-positive cells, and live viruses emerged in the lung tissues, indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection."
12187,"Taken together, these data suggest that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV."
12188, The highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has caused huge economic losses to the swine industry in China.
12189,Understanding the molecular basis in relation to the virulence of HP-PRRSV is essential for effectively controlling clinical infection and disease.
12190,"In the current study, we constructed and rescued a serial of mutant viruses in nsp9 and nsp10 based on the differential amino acid sites between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9."
12191,The replication efficiency in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and the pathogenicity of the mutant viruses for piglets were analyzed.
12192,"Our results showed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 decreased the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs, and could attenuate its virulence for piglets, suggesting that the residues 586 and 592 of nsp9 are critical sites natively in determining the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV for piglets."
12193,Emerging zoonoses have had a serious impact on human and animal health in recent decades.
12194,"More often than not, these disease outbreaks have taken public health by surprise because we have failed to shift the epidemiological curve to the far left and detect zoonoses in animal populations prior to spillover to people."
12195,Not only can animals serve as valuable sentinels for emerging zoonoses but also much can be gained by the study of the animals themselves.
12196,Influenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel influenza virus that infects cattle and swine.
12197,The goal of this study was to investigate the replication and transmission of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs.
12198,"Following direct intranasal inoculation of animals, the virus was detected in nasal washes of infected animals during the first 7 days postinfection."
12199,High viral titers were obtained from nasal turbinates and lung tissues of directly inoculated animals.
12200,"Further, bovine FLUDV was able to transmit from the infected guinea pigs to sentinel animals by means of contact and not by aerosol dissemination under the experimental conditions tested in this study."
12201,"Despite exhibiting no clinical signs, infected guinea pigs developed seroconversion and the viral antigen was detected in lungs of animals by immunohistochemistry."
12202,"The observation that bovine FLUDV replicated in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs was similar to observations described previously in studies of gnotobiotic calves and pigs experimentally infected with bovine FLUDV but different from those described previously in experimental infections in ferrets and swine with a swine FLUDV, which supported virus replication only in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lower respiratory tract, including lung."
12203,Our study established that guinea pigs could be used as an animal model for studying this newly emerging influenza virus.
12204,IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel emerging pathogen with bovine as its primary host.
12205,The epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus are not yet known.
12206,"FLUDV also spreads to swine, and the presence of FLUDV-specific antibodies in humans could indicate that there is a potential for zoonosis."
12207,Our results showed that bovine FLUDV replicated in the nasal turbinate and lungs of guinea pigs at high titers and was also able to transmit from an infected animal to sentinel animals by contact.
12208,"The fact that bovine FLUDV replicated productively in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of guinea pigs, similarly to virus infection in its native host, demonstrates that guinea pigs would be a suitable model host to study the replication and transmission potential of bovine FLUDV."
12209,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet fully efficacious treatments are missing."
12210,"In this study, we investigated RNA interference (RNAi), a specific gene silencing process mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, as an antiviral strategy against HCV."
12211,"Synthetic siRNAs were designed to target conserved sequences of the HCV 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) located in a functional, stem–loop structured domain of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which is crucial for initiation of polyprotein translation."
12212,"Several siRNAs dramatically reduced or even abrogated the replication of selectable subgenomic HCV replicons upon cotransfection of human hepatoma cells with viral target and siRNAs, or upon transfection of cells supporting autonomous replication of HCV replicon with siRNAs."
12213,"Importantly, three siRNAs also proved capable of strongly inhibiting virus production in cell culture."
12214,"One siRNA, targeting a sequence that is highly conserved across all genotypes and forms a critical pseudoknot structure involved in translation, was identified as the most promising therapeutic candidate."
12215,"These results indicate that the HCV life cycle can be efficiently blocked by using properly-designed siRNAs that target functionally important, highly conserved sequences of the HCV IRES."
12216,This finding offers a novel approach towards developing IRES-based antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infections.
12217,: This study describes a model developed to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated swine feed ingredients and the effect of two mitigation strategies during a simulated transport event from China to the US.
12218,"RESULTS: Ingredients imported to the USA from China, including organic & conventional soybeans and meal, lysine hydrochloride, D-L methionine, tryptophan, Vitamins A, D & E, choline, carriers (rice hulls, corn cobs) and feed grade tetracycline, were inoculated with PEDV."
12219,"Control ingredients, and treatments (ingredients plus a liquid antimicrobial (SalCURB, Kemin Industries (LA) or a 2 % custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA)) were tested."
12220,"The model ran for 37 days, simulating transport of cargo from Beijing, China to Des Moines, IA, US from December 23, 2012 to January 28, 2013."
12221,"To mimic conditions on land and sea, historical temperature and percent relative humidity (% RH) data were programmed into an environmental chamber which stored all containers."
12222,"To evaluate PEDV viability over time, ingredients were organized into 1 of 4 batches of samples, each batch representing a specific segment of transport."
12223,Batch 1 (segment 1) simulated transport of contaminated ingredients from manufacturing plants in Beijing (day 1 post-contamination (PC)).
12224,"Batch 2 (segments 1 and 2) simulated manufacturing and delivery to Shanghai, including time in Anquing terminal awaiting shipment (days 1–8 PC)."
12225,"Batch 3 (segments 1, 2 and 3) represented time in China, the crossing of the Pacific and entry to the US at the San Francisco, CA terminal (day 1–27 PC)."
12226,"Batch 4 (segments 1–4) represented the previous events, including transport to Des Moines, IA (days 1–37 PC)."
12227,"Across control (non-treated) ingredients, viable PEDV was detected in soybean meal (organic and conventional), Vitamin D, lysine hydrochloride and choline chloride."
12228,"In contrast, viable PEDV was not detected in any samples treated with LA or MCFA."
12229,CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the ability of PEDV to survive in a subset of feed ingredients using a model simulating shipment from China to the US.
12230,"This is proof of concept suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients could serve as transboundary risk factors for PEDV, along with the identification of effective mitigation options."
12231,"The Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV) model has been used to study the interactions of virus, myelin and anti-neuroantigen autoimmunity, TMEV and myelin can interrelate during virus entry and persistence."
12232,"On virus entry, TMEV might use peripheral myelin P0 protein as a virus receptor."
12233,"For persistence, TMEV seems to require myelin functional proteins or structural myelin itself."
12234,"Here, myelin and oligodendrocyte loss and downregulation of myelin genes would lead to demyelination, but might limit virus spread in the central nervous system."
12235,"Unlike experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a pathogenic role of anti-myelin autoimmunity is unclear in TMEV infection."
12236,Anti-myelin autoantibodies have been detected in TMEV infection.
12237,"Among them, only anti-galactocerebroside (GC) antibody is shown to be myelinotoxic, and has molecular mimicry with TMEV."
12238,Myelin-specific T cells play no role in initiation or progression of demyelination in the first two to three months after TMEV infection.
12239,"However, cellular autoimmunity against several myelin antigens (epitope spreading) can be detected during the late chronic stage."
12240,"Using the TMEV model, epitope spreading and autoantibody-mediated remyelination have been investigated by recombinant TMEV and anti-neuroantigen (natural) antibodies, respectively"
12241,"Live animal markets (LAMs) are an essential source of food and trade in Latin American countries; however, they can also serve as ‘hotbeds' for the emergence and potential spillover of avian influenza viruses (AIV)."
12242,"Despite extensive knowledge of AIV in Asian LAMs, little is known about the prevalence South American LAMs."
12243,"To fill this gap in knowledge, active surveillance was carried out at the major LAM in Medellin, Colombia between February and September 2015."
12244,"During this period, overall prevalence in the market was 2.67% and a North American origin H11N2 AIV most similar to a virus isolated from Chilean shorebirds asymptomatically spread through multiple bird species in the market resulting in 17.0% positivity at peak of infection."
12245,"Phenotypically, the H11 viruses displayed no known molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals, had α2,3-sialic acid binding preference, and caused minimal replication in vitro and little morbidity in vivo."
12246,"However, the Colombian H11N2 virus replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens explaining the spread throughout the market."
12247,Genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from North and South American shorebirds suggest that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover event.
12248,The ability to spread in domestic poultry as well as potential for human infection by H11 viruses highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America in both avian species and humans.
12249,"An ideal animal model for the study of a human disease is one which utilizes a route of infection that mimics the natural transmission of the pathogen; the ability to obtain disease with an infectious dose equivalent to that causing disease in humans; as well having a disease course, morbidity and mortality similar to that seen with human disease."
12250,"Additionally, the animal model should have a mode(s) of transmission that mimics human cases."
12251,"The development of small animal models for the study of monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been quite extensive for the relatively short period of time this pathogen has been known, although only a few of these models have been used to study anti-poxvirus agents."
12252,We will review those MPXV small animal models that have been developed thus far for the study of therapeutic agents.
12253," The coronaviruses, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) represent important sources of neonatal diarrhea on pig farms."
12254,"The requirement for aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for TGEV, but not for PEDV, is well established."
12255,"In this study, the biological relevance of APN as a receptor for PDCoV was tested by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the APN gene, ANPEP, in pigs."
12256,Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from ANPEP knockout (KO) pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection.
12257,"However, lung fibroblast-like cells, derived from the ANPEP KO PAM cultures, supported PDCoV infection to high levels."
12258,The results suggest that APN is a receptor for PDCoV in PAMs but is not necessary for infection of lung-derived fibroblast cells.
12259,The infection of the ANPEP KO pigs with PDCoV further confirmed that APN is dispensable as a receptor for PDCoV.
12260,: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae and is a causative agent of an economically important disease in poultry.
12261,"The spike glycoprotein of IBV is essential for host cell attachment, neutralization, and is involved in the induction of protective immunity."
12262,Previously obtained sequence data of the spike gene of IBV QX-like and Massachusetts strains were subjected to bioinformatics analysis.
12263,"FINDINGS: On analysis of potential phosphorylation sites, the Ser542 and Ser563 sites were not present in Massachusetts strains, while QX-like isolates did not have the Ser534 site."
12264,Massachusetts and QX-like strains showed different cleavage site motifs.
12265,"The N-glycosylation sites ASN-XAA-SER/THR-55, 147, 200 and 545 were additionally present in QX-like strains."
12266,"The leucine-rich repeat regions in Massachusetts strains consisted of stretches of 63 to 69 amino acids, while in the QX-like strains they contained 59 amino acids in length."
12267,An additional palmitoylation site was observed in CK/SWE/082066/2010 a QX-like strain.
12268,Primary structure data showed difference in the physical properties and hydrophobic nature of both genotypes.
12269,The comparison of secondary structures revealed no new structural domains in the genotypic variants.
12270,The phylogenetic analyses based on avian and mammalian coronaviruses showed the analysed IBV as closely related to turkey coronaviruses and distantly related to thrush and munia coronaviruses.
12271,CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that spike glycoprotein of the Massachusetts and the QX-like variants of IBV are molecularly distinct and that this may reflect in differences in the behavior of these viruses in vivo.
12272," Like other RNA viruses, influenza viruses are subject to high mutation rates."
12273,"Carrying segmented RNA genomes, their genetic variability is even higher."
12274,We aimed at analyzing the mutational events occurring during the infection of chickens by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus.
12275,"We therefore studied the different sequences of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as two internal proteins, PB2 and NS."
12276,"Three organs (lung, spleen, brain) were obtained from a chicken, experimentally infected with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus."
12277,Cloning these PCR fragments enabled us to investigate the mutations undergone by the virus after several replicative cycles.
12278,"The first outcome is the presence of a strong mutational bias, resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination, which is responsible for 81% of all mutations."
12279,"Whereas the frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations is compatible with the survival of the virus, the ADAR1-like activity usually strongly increases the mutation frequency into a level of “error catastrophe” in theory incompatible with virus survival."
12280,"Nevertheless, the virus was successfully infective."
12281,HPAI H5N1 virus displayed traits in agreement with the quasispecies theory.
12282,The role of this quasispecies structure in successful infection and the superposition with the ADAR1-like response is discussed.
12283,"The oncogenic gammaherpesviruses, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), are etiologically associated with a variety of human cancers, including Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL)."
12284,"Recently, we demonstrated KSHV infection of B- and endothelial cells to significantly upregulate the expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) which in turn enhances virus entry."
12285,This is an extension of the above study.
12286,"In here, we determined EBV infection of cells to trigger IFITM1 expression, in vitro."
12287,Silencing IFITM1 expression using siRNA specifically lowered gammaherpesvirus infection of cells at a post binding stage of entry.
12288,A natural model system to explore the effect of IFITM1 on gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo is infection of BALB/c mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68).
12289,Priming mice with siRNA specific to IFITM1 significantly lowered MHV-68 titers in the lung specimens compared to priming with (NS)siRNA or PBS.
12290,MHV-68 titers were monitored by plaque assay and qPCR.
12291,"Taken together, for the first time, this study provides insight into the critical role of IFITM1 to promoting in vivo gammaherpesvirus infections."
12292,Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) that causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates (up to 92%).
12293,"NiV can cause Acute Lung Injury (ALI) in humans, and human-to-human transmission has been observed in recent outbreaks of NiV."
12294,"While the exact route of transmission to humans is not known, we have previously shown that NiV can efficiently infect human respiratory epithelial cells."
12295,The molecular mechanisms of NiV-associated ALI in the human respiratory tract are unknown.
12296,"Thus, there is an urgent need for models of henipavirus infection of the human respiratory tract to study the pathogenesis and understand the host responses."
12297,"Here, we describe a novel human lung xenograft model in mice to study the pathogenesis of NiV."
12298,"Following transplantation, human fetal lung xenografts rapidly graft and develop mature structures of adult lungs including cartilage, vascular vessels, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and primitive “air” spaces filled with mucus and lined by cuboidal to flat epithelium."
12299,"Following infection, NiV grows to high titers (10(7) TCID(50)/gram lung tissue) as early as 3 days post infection (pi)."
12300,"NiV targets both the endothelium as well as respiratory epithelium in the human lung tissues, and results in syncytia formation."
12301,"NiV infection in the human lung results in the production of several cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IP-10, eotaxin, G-CSF and GM-CSF on days 5 and 7 pi."
12302,"In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NiV can replicate to high titers in a novel in vivo model of the human respiratory tract, resulting in a robust inflammatory response, which is known to be associated with ALI."
12303,This model will facilitate progress in the fundamental understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis and virus-host interactions; it will also provide biologically relevant models for other respiratory viruses.
12304,"The significance of bats as sources of emerging infectious diseases has been increasingly appreciated, and new data have been accumulated rapidly during recent years."
12305,"For some emerging pathogens the bat origin has been confirmed (such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, coronaviruses), for other it has been suggested (filoviruses)."
12306,"Several recently identified viruses remain to be ‘orphan’ but have a potential for further emergence (such as Tioman, Menangle, and Pulau viruses)."
12307,"In the present review we summarize information on major bat-associated emerging infections and discuss specific characteristics of bats as carriers of pathogens (from evolutionary, ecological, and immunological positions)."
12308,"We also discuss drivers and forces of an infectious disease emergence and describe various existing and potential approaches for control and prevention of such infections at individual, populational, and societal levels."
12309,Bat-borne viruses have been linked to a number of zoonotic diseases; in 2014 there have been human cases of Nipah virus (NiV) in Bangladesh and Ebola virus in West and Central Africa.
12310,"Here we describe a model designed to provide initial quantitative predictions of the risk of entry of such viruses to European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) through four routes: human travel, legal trade (e.g."
12311,"fruit and animal products), live animal movements and illegal importation of bushmeat."
12312,The model utilises available datasets to assess the movement via these routes between individual countries of the world and EU MSs.
12313,These data are combined with virus specific data to assess the relative risk of entry between EU MSs.
12314,"As a case study, the model was parameterised for NiV."
12315,Scenario analyses showed that the selection of exporting countries with NiV and potentially contaminated trade products were essential to the accuracy of all model outputs.
12316,Uncertainty analyses of other model parameters identified that the model expected number of years to an introduction event within the EU was highly susceptible to the prevalence of NiV in bats.
12317,"The relative rankings of the MSs and routes, however, were more robust."
12318,"The UK, the Netherlands and Germany were consistently the most likely points of entry and the ranking of most MSs varied by no more than three places (maximum variation five places)."
12319,"Legal trade was consistently the most likely route of entry, only falling below human travel when the estimate of the prevalence of NiV in bats was particularly low."
12320,"Any model-based calculation is dependent on the data available to feed into the model and there are distinct gaps in our knowledge, particularly in regard to various pathogen/virus as well as host/bat characteristics."
12321,"However, the strengths of this model lie in the provision of relative comparisons of risk among routes and MSs."
12322,The potential for expansion of the model to include other routes and viruses and the possibility of rapid parameterisation demonstrates its potential for use in an outbreak situation.
12323," The science of epidemiology has been developed over the last 200years, using traditional methods to describe the distribution of diseases by person, place, and time."
12324,"However, in the last several decades, a new set of technologies has become available, based on the methods of computer sciences, systems biology, and the extraordinary powers of the Internet."
12325,"Technological and analytical advances can enhance traditional epidemiological methods to study the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of viruses and associated diseases."
12326,Social media are increasingly used to detect the emergence and geographic spread of viral disease outbreaks.
12327,"Large-scale population movement can be estimated using satellite imagery and mobile phone use, and fine-scale population movement can be tracked using global positioning system loggers, allowing estimation of transmission pathways and contact patterns at different spatial scales."
12328,"Advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics permit more accurate determination of viral evolution and the construction of transmission networks, also at different spatial and temporal scales."
12329,Phylodynamics links evolutionary and epidemiological processes to better understand viral transmission patterns.
12330,"More complex and realistic mathematical models of virus transmission within human and animal populations, including detailed agent-based models, are increasingly used to predict transmission patterns and the impact of control interventions such as vaccination and quarantine."
12331,"In this chapter, we will briefly review traditional epidemiological methods and then describe the new technologies with some examples of their application."
12332,"Immunological checkpoints, such as the inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R), play a dual role in balancing the immune system during microbial infection."
12333,On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen.
12334,We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models.
12335,"We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice."
12336,MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans.
12337,We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling.
12338,"This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200(−/−) mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro."
12339,In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling.
12340,"However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females."
12341,"Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection."
12342,Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.
12343," Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease associated with environmental factors, possibly including several viruses such as the coronaviruses."
12344,"Indeed, murine coronavirus (MHV) infection provides a well-known experimental model for MS studies."
12345,Intracerebral infection of C57BL/6 mice with MHV-A59 revealed that viral replication was efficient and that clearance of infectious virus occurred as soon as 7 days post-infection.
12346,"Using cDNA arrays, analysis of gene expression profile in the brain revealed a modulation of 80 different genes following infection, with at least 27 of these genes having previously been directly related to innate or acquired immune responses."
12347,"Concordingly, an important activation of auto-reactive T cells specific to myelin basic protein was demonstrated."
12348,"Altogether, these results indicate that an MHV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to an important host genomic response implicating immunity-related genes and to the activation of myelin-reactive autoimmune T cells."
12349,Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified to cause severe respiratory infection in humans since 2012.
12350,The continuing MERS epidemic with a case-fatality of more than 30 % poses a major threat to public health worldwide.
12351,"Currently, the pathogenesis of human MERS-CoV infection remains poorly understood."
12352,"We reviewed experimental findings from human primary cells and ex vivo human lung tissues, as well as those from animal studies, so as to understand the pathogenesis and high case-fatality of MERS."
12353,Human respiratory epithelial cells are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can support productive viral replication.
12354,"However, the induction of antiviral cytokines and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are substantially dampened in the infected epithelial cells, due to the antagonistic mechanisms evolved by the virus."
12355,"MERS-CoV can readily infect and robustly replicate in human macrophages and dendritic cells, triggering the aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines."
12356,MERS-CoV can also effectively infect human primary T cells and induce massive apoptosis in these cells.
12357,"Although data from clinical, in vitro and ex vivo studies suggested the potential for virus dissemination, extrapulmonary involvement in MERS patients has not been ascertained due to the lack of autopsy study."
12358,"In MERS-CoV permissive animal models, although viral RNA can be detected from multiple organs of the affected animals, the brain of human DPP4-transgenic mouse was the only extrapulmonary organ from which the infectious virus can be recovered."
12359,More research findings on the pathogenesis of MERS and the tissue tropisms of MERS-CoV may help to improve the treatment and infection control of MERS.
12360,": Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has never been reported in Denmark, but it has been found in Europe, Asia and North America."
12361,"Ultimately, PEDV has been associated with devastating outbreaks in pig farms."
12362,"We developed a stochastic simulation model to carry out a quantitative risk assessment and to estimate the annual probability (PPlasma) of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population, by imported spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP)."
12363,The model was based on information from literature and Danish feed companies.
12364,Moreover testing the batch of raw blood (before the spray-drying) was considered as potential risk mitigation measure in the future.
12365,RESULTS: The median PPlasma was 0.2 % (90 % P.I.
12366,: 0.003 %; 2.6 %).
12367,"Hence, the annual probability of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population by imported SDPP appeared very low, and on average at least one introduction each 500 years – corresponding to 1/0.002 - could be expected."
12368,"However, if PEDV survived the spray-drying process and storage was insufficient to completely remove the remaining viable virus (e.g."
12369,due to storage at low environmental temperatures during a short time period) the PPlasma was 4.7 % (0.06 %; 57.4 %).
12370,"In that case, on average, at least one PEDV introduction each 21 years could be expected."
12371,This probability could be reduced to 0.3 % (0.004 %; 6.0 %) if the raw batch of blood could be tested before drying (corresponding to at least one introduction each 333 years on average).
12372,CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary and important information on the probability of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population by use of SDPP.
12373,"Currently PED is not a notifiable disease in the EU and uncertainty was present in our estimates due to possible underreporting in EU Member States, from which SDPP is imported into Denmark."
12374,"In the future, PED might become a notifiable disease, and in such a case, new knowledge could become available on its epidemiology."
12375,"Moreover, SDPP could be imported more safely if: producers find a way to substantiate freedom from disease (at least) in herds delivering blood for SDPP, the batch of blood tests negative for PEDV and conditions for processing/storage required by the international laws are respected."
12376,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and, to date, has been identified in 180 cases with 43% mortality."
12377,"In this study, we have determined the MERS-CoV evolutionary rate, documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the Arabian peninsula, and identified the genome positions under positive selection, important features for monitoring adaptation of MERS-CoV to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections."
12378,"Respiratory samples from confirmed KSA MERS cases from May to September 2013 were subjected to whole-genome deep sequencing, and 32 complete or partial sequences (20 were ≥99% complete, 7 were 50 to 94% complete, and 5 were 27 to 50% complete) were obtained, bringing the total available MERS-CoV genomic sequences to 65."
12379,"An evolutionary rate of 1.12 × 10(−3) substitutions per site per year (95% credible interval [95% CI], 8.76 × 10(−4); 1.37 × 10(−3)) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95% CI, December 2011; June 2012)."
12380,"Only one MERS-CoV codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection."
12381,"Four KSA MERS-CoV phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases."
12382,"The size of the population infected with MERS-CoV showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R(0)) for the virus that is less than 1."
12383,Viral infection of the central nervous system can lead to disability and death.
12384,"Yet the majority of viral infections with central nervous system involvement resolve with only mild clinical manifestations, if any."
12385,"This is generally attributed to efficient elimination of the infection from the brain coverings, i.e."
12386,"the meninges, ependyma and chorioplexus, which are the primary targets of haematogeneous viral spread."
12387,How the immune system is able to purge these structures from viral infection with only minimal detrimental effects is still poorly understood.
12388,In the present work we studied how an attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can be cleared from the central nervous system in the absence of overt disease.
12389,"We show that elimination of the virus from brain ependyma, but not from brain parenchyma, could be achieved by a T cell-dependent mechanism operating independently of major histocompatibility class I antigens and perforin."
12390,"Considering that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity is a leading cause of viral immunopathology and tissue damage, our findings may explain why the most common viral intruders of the central nervous system rarely represent a serious threat to our health."
12391,Comparisons were made between human enteric coronaviruses and the enteric coronaviruses of pigs and calves by negative staining.
12392,Examination of human intestinal organ culture fluids at various time intervals after inoculation with the human enteric coronavirus showed increasing numbers of particles in the fluids.
12393,Thin sections of the columnar epithelial cells of these explants showed a number of features consistent with the replication of known human and animal coronaviruses.
12394,Virus particles found in thin sections had a mean diameter of 68 nm.
12395,"In addition, a structure was found in thin sections which has not been described previously."
12396,This structure may represent the viral nucleocapsid.
12397, There have been rapid recent developments in establishing methods for identifying and characterising viruses associated with animal and human diseases.
12398,"These methodologies, commonly based on hybridisation or PCR techniques, are combined with advanced sequencing techniques termed ‘next generation sequencing’."
12399,"Allied advances in data analysis, including the use of computational transcriptome subtraction, have also impacted the field of viral pathogen discovery."
12400,"This review details these molecular detection techniques, discusses their application in viral discovery, and provides an overview of some of the novel viruses discovered."
12401,The problems encountered in attributing disease causality to a newly identified virus are also considered.
12402,Bat virus host shifts can result in the spread of diseases with significant effects.
12403,The rabies virus (RABV) is able to infect almost all mammals and is therefore a useful model for the study of host shift mechanisms.
12404,Carnivore RABVs originated from two historical host shifts from bat viruses.
12405,"To reveal the genetic pathways by which bat RABVs changed their host tropism from bats to carnivores, we investigated the second permanent bat-to-carnivore shift resulting in two carnivore variants, known as raccoon RABV (RRV) and south-central skunk RABV (SCSKV)."
12406,We found that their glycoprotein (G) genes are the result of recombination between an American bat virus and a carnivore virus.
12407,This recombination allowed the bat RABV to acquire the head of the G-protein ectodomain of the carnivore virus.
12408,"This region is involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to changes in the pH microenvironment, trimerization of G proteins, and cell-to-cell transmission during the viral infection."
12409,"Therefore, this recombination event may have significantly improved the variant’s adaptability to carnivores, altering its host tropism and thus leading to large-scale epidemics in striped skunk and raccoon."
12410,"To investigate the potential of adeno-associated viruses serotype 2 (AAV2)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as an antiviral agent against rabies, recombinant AAV2 vectors expressing siRNA targeting the nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus (RABV) (rAAV-N796) were constructed and evaluated."
12411,"When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N796 were challenged with RABV, there was a 37.8 ± 3.4% to 55.1 ± 5.3% reduction in RABV virus titer."
12412,"When cells pre-challenged with RABV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 ± 1.4 to 28.8 ± 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer."
12413,Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RABV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer.
12414,"When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations."
12415,"Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 ± 5.3 and 62.5 ± 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RABV."
12416,"When mice treated intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 were challenged intramuscularly with lethal RABV, they exhibited 37.5 ± 3.7% protection."
12417,"When mice were intracerebrally and intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 24 hr after exposure to RABV infection, they exhibited 25 ± 4.1% protection The N gene mRNA levels in the brains of challenged mice with three different administrations were reduced (55, 68, 32 and 25%, respectively)."
12418,"These results indicated that AAV2 vector-mediated siRNA delivery in vitro in NA cells inhibited RABV multiplication, inhibited RABV multiplication in vivo in the mice brain and imparted partial protection against lethal rabies."
12419,"So, it may have a potential to be used as an alternative antiviral approach against rabies."
12420,": The outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as SARS coronavirus, H5N1, H1N1, and recently H7N9 influenza viruses, have been associated with significant mortality and morbidity in humans."
12421,Neutralizing antibodies from individuals who have recovered from an infection confer therapeutic protection to others infected with the same pathogen.
12422,"However, survivors may not always be available for providing plasma or for the cloning of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)."
12423,"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The genome and the immunoglobulin genes in rhesus macaques and humans are highly homologous; therefore, we investigated whether neutralizing mAbs that are highly homologous to those of humans (human-like) could be generated."
12424,"Using the H5N1 influenza virus as a model, we first immunized rhesus macaques with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin (HA)."
12425,"Following screening an antibody phage display library derived from the B cells of immunized monkeys, we cloned selected macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions into the human IgG constant region, which generated human-macaque chimeric mAbs exhibiting over 97% homology to human antibodies."
12426,"Selected mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against three clades (0, 1, 2) of the H5N1 influenza viruses."
12427,The in vivo protection experiments demonstrated that the mAbs effectively protected the mice even when administered up to 3 days after infection with H5N1 influenza virus.
12428,"In particular, mAb 4E6 demonstrated sub-picomolar binding affinity to HA and superior in vivo protection efficacy without the loss of body weight and obvious lung damage."
12429,The analysis of the 4E6 escape mutants demonstrated that the 4E6 antibody bound to a conserved epitope region containing two amino acids on the globular head of HA.
12430,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated the generation of neutralizing mAbs for potential application in humans in urgent preparedness against outbreaks of new influenza infections or other virulent infectious diseases.
12431," Observational data suggest that the treatment of influenza infection with neuraminidase inhibitors decreases progression to more severe illness, especially when treatment is started soon after symptom onset."
12432,"However, even early treatment might fail to prevent complications in some patients, particularly those infected with novel viruses such as the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, avian influenza A H5N1 virus subtype, or the avian influenza A H7N9 virus subtype."
12433,"Furthermore, treatment with one antiviral drug might promote the development of antiviral resistance, especially in immunocompromised hosts and critically ill patients."
12434,An obvious strategy to optimise antiviral therapy is to combine drugs with different modes of action.
12435,"Because host immune responses to infection might also contribute to illness pathogenesis, improved outcomes might be gained from the combination of antiviral therapy with drugs that modulate the immune response in an infected individual."
12436,We review available data from preclinical and clinical studies of combination antiviral therapy and of combined antiviral-immunomodulator therapy for influenza.
12437,"Early-stage data draw attention to several promising antiviral combinations with therapeutic potential in severe infections, but there remains a need to substantiate clinical benefit."
12438,Combination therapies with favourable experimental data need to be tested in carefully designed aclinical trials to assess their efficacy.
12439, The nonstructural polyproteins of Sindbis virus are processed by a virus-encoded proteinase which is located in the C-terminal domain of nsP2.
12440,Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase.
12441,Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro.
12442,"Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme."
12443,These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558.
12444,"Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity."
12445,"Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual."
12446,"A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase."
12447,"All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested."
12448,"In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication."
12449,"Ebola virus (EBOV), family Filoviridae, emerged in 1976 on the African continent."
12450,Since then it caused several outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans with case fatality rates up to 90% and remains a serious Public Health concern and biothreat pathogen.
12451,The most pathogenic and best-studied species is Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV).
12452,"EBOV encodes one viral surface glycoprotein (GP), which is essential for replication, a determinant of pathogenicity and an important immunogen."
12453,"GP mediates viral entry through interaction with cellular surface molecules, which results in the uptake of virus particles via macropinocytosis."
12454,"Later in this pathway endosomal acidification activates the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL), which have been shown to cleave ZEBOV-GP leading to subsequent exposure of the putative receptor-binding and fusion domain and productive infection."
12455,We studied the effect of CatB and CatL on in vitro and in vivo replication of EBOV.
12456,"Similar to previous findings, our results show an effect of CatB, but not CatL, on ZEBOV entry into cultured cells."
12457,"Interestingly, cell entry by other EBOV species (Bundibugyo, Côte d'Ivoire, Reston and Sudan ebolavirus) was independent of CatB or CatL as was EBOV replication in general."
12458,"To investigate whether CatB and CatL have a role in vivo during infection, we utilized the mouse model for ZEBOV."
12459,"Wild-type (control), catB(−/−) and catL(−/−) mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted ZEBOV with no difference in virus replication and time to death."
12460,"In conclusion, our results show that CatB and CatL activity is not required for EBOV replication."
12461,"Furthermore, EBOV glycoprotein cleavage seems to be mediated by an array of proteases making targeted therapeutic approaches difficult."
12462,Existing and emerging viral CNS infections are major sources of human morbidity and mortality.
12463,Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited predominantly to herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus.
12464,"Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and by the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that may be rare, or in the case of arboviral infections, often have variable seasonal and geographic incidence."
12465,"Nonetheless, many novel approaches to antiviral therapy are available including candidate thiazolide and purazinecarboxamide derivatives with potential broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy."
12466,New herpesvirus drugs include viral helicase-primase and terminase inhibitors.
12467,The use of antisense oligonucleotides and other strategies to interfere with viral RNA translation has shown efficacy in experimental models of CNS viral disease.
12468,Identifying specific molecular targets within viral replication cycles has led to many existing antivirals and will undoubtedly continue to be the basis of future drug design.
12469,A promising new area of research involves therapies based on enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses.
12470,"Toll-like receptor agonists, and drugs that inhibit specific cytokines as well as interferon preparations have all shown potential therapeutic efficacy."
12471,Passive transfer of virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes have been used in humans and may provide an effective therapies for some herpesvirus infections and potentially for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
12472,Humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against specific viral proteins have been developed and in several cases evaluated in humans in settings including West Nile virus and HIV infection and in pre-exposure prophylaxis for rabies.
12473,"To determine whether an immunological or pharmaceutical product has potential for therapy in treating multiple sclerosis (MS), detailed animal models are required."
12474,"To date many animal models for human MS have been described in mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, marmosets, and rhesus monkeys."
12475,"The most comprehensive studies have involved murine experimental allergic (or autoimmune) encephalomyelitis (EAE), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)."
12476,"Here, we describe in detail multispecies animal models of human MS, namely EAE, SFV, MHV, and TMEV, in addition to chemically induced demyelination."
12477,The validity and applicability of each of these models are critically evaluated.
12478,"Viral diseases exhibit spatial and temporal variation, and there are many factors that can affect their occurrence."
12479,The identification of these factors is critical in the efforts to predict and lessen viral disease burden.
12480,"Because viral infection is able to spread to humans from the environment, animals, and other humans, the One-Health framework can be used to investigate the critical pathways through which viruses are transported and transmitted."
12481,"A holistic approach, incorporating publicly available clinical data for human, livestock, and wildlife disease occurrence, together with environmental data reported in federal and state databases such as parameters related to land use, environmental quality, and weather, can enhance the understanding of variations in disease patterns, leading to the design and implementation of surveillance systems."
12482,"An example analysis approach is presented for Michigan, United States, which is a state with large urban centers as well as a sizeable rural and agricultural population."
12483,Analysis of publicly available data from 2017 indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) and influenza-associated illnesses in Michigan may have been related with agricultural land use to a higher extent than with developed land use during that year.
12484,"Meanwhile, hepatitis A virus appears to be most closely related with developed land use in dense population areas."
12485,"GI illnesses may be related to precipitation, and this relationship is strongest in the springtime, although GI illnesses are most common in the winter months."
12486,"Integration of human-related clinical data, animal disease data, and environmental data can ultimately be used for prioritization of the most critical locations and times for viral outbreaks in both urban and rural environments."
12487,High-tech biomedical advances have led to increases both in the number of mice used for research and in exchanges of mice and/or their tissues between institutions.
12488,The latter are associated with the risk of dissemination of infectious agents.
12489,"Because of the lack of international standardization of health surveillance programs, health certificates for imported rodents may be informative but may not address the needs of the importing facility."
12490,"Preservation of mouse germ-plasm is achieved by cryopreservation of spermatozoa, embryos, or ovaries, and embryonic stem cells are used for the production of genetically engineered mice."
12491,"After embryo transfer, recipients and rederived pups that test negative in microbiological screening for relevant microorganisms are released into full barrier holding areas."
12492,"However, current research shows that embryos may also transmit microorganisms, especially viruses, to the recipient mice."
12493,"In this article, we discuss regulations and practical issues in the shipping of live mice and mouse tissues, including spermatozoa, embryos, ovaries, and embryonic stem cells, and review work on microbial contamination of these biological materials."
12494,"In addition, we present ways to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens to mice under routine conditions."
12495, The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has led to a renewed interest in studying the role of accessory proteins in regulating coronavirus infections in the natural host.
12496,"A significant body of evidence has accumulated in the area of SARS-CoV and host interactions that indicate that the accessory proteins might play an important role in modulating the host response to virus infection and thereby, contribute to pathogenesis."
12497,"In this review, we have compiled the current knowledge about SARS-CoV accessory proteins, obtained from studies in cell culture systems, reverse genetics and animal models, to shed some light into the possible role of these proteins in the propagation and virulence of SARS-CoV in its natural host."
12498,We conclude by providing some questions for future studies that will greatly advance our knowledge about the biological significance and contributions of the accessory proteins in the development of SARS in humans.
12499,Duck plague virus (DPV) is a representative pathogen transmitted among aquatic animals that causes gross lesions and immune inhibition in geese and ducks.
12500,The mechanism of organ tropism and innate immune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses.
12501,"In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays."
12502,Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs.
12503,"DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible."
12504,The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes.
12505,"Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages."
12506,"The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes."
12507,"The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes."
12508,"The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively."
12509,Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain.
12510,Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain.
12511,"The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations."
12512,"Our study provided practical methods for isolating and culturing duck primary cells, and our results will facilitate further investigations of organ tropism, innate immune responses, latent infection, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating DPV and potentially other aerial bird pathogens."
12513,"Infection of mice with variants of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), provide models of acute and chronic viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS)."
12514,"Through targeted recombination and reverse genetic manipulation, studies of infection with MHV-JHM variants have identified phenotypic differences and examined the effects of these differences on viral pathogenesis and anti-viral host immune responses."
12515,Studies employing recombinant viruses with a modified spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV-JHM have identified the S gene as a major determinant of neurovirulence.
12516,"However, the association of S gene variation and neurovirulence with host ability to generate anti-viral CD8 T cell responses is not completely clear."
12517,Partially protective anti-viral immune responses may result in persistent infection and chronic demyelinating disease characterized by myelin removal from axons of the CNS and associated with dense macrophage/microglial infiltration.
12518,"Demyelinating disease during MHV-JHM infection is immune-mediated, as mice that lack T lymphocytes fail to develop disease despite succumbing to encephalitis with high levels of infectious virus in the CNS."
12519,"However, the presence of T lymphocytes or anti-viral antibody can induce disease in infected immunodeficient mice."
12520,"The mechanisms by which these immune effectors induce demyelination share an ability to activate and recruit macrophages and microglia, thus increasing the putative role of these cells in myelin destruction."
12521,"Astroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses."
12522,"Their genomes contain three open reading frames, but the exact number of encoded proteins remains unknown."
12523,"Astroviruses were originally identified in association with childhood diarrhea; subsequently, they have been identified as a common enteric virus infecting children under the age of 2."
12524,"Infection is not restricted to humans, however, and host-specific astroviruses have been found in association with a variety of mammalian and avian species."
12525,"Generally, infection causes a mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, although infection in chickens and ducklings can result in nephritis or severe hepatitis, respectively."
12526,The immune response to astrovirus infection is only poorly characterized and may differ between mammalian and avian species.
12527,"In this article, the current knowledge of astroviruses is reviewed, including their molecular virology, viral evolution, pathogenesis, and immune response."
12528,: The effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood.
12529,This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting.
12530,RESULTS: PEDV RNA was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (INF) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
12531,Virus shedding in INF pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral RNA levels remained elevated through 19 dpi.
12532,Sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (LB) became PEDV positive after the first movement of study personnel from the INF group.
12533,"However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated."
12534,Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel.
12535,"In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected."
12536,All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative.
12537,CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions.
12538,"Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs."
12539,Hypusination of eIF5A as a Target for Antiviral Therapy
12540,Marburg virus (MARV) is an Ebola-like virus in the family Filovirdae that causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate as high as 90%.
12541,"AVI-7288, a positively charged antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMOplus) targeting the viral nucleoprotein gene, was evaluated as a potential therapeutic intervention for MARV infection following delayed treatment of 1, 24, 48, and 96 h post-infection (PI) in a nonhuman primate lethal challenge model."
12542,"A total of 30 cynomolgus macaques were divided into 5 groups of 6 and infected with 1,830 plaque forming units of MARV subcutaneously."
12543,AVI-7288 was administered by bolus infusion daily for 14 days at 15 mg/kg body weight.
12544,Survival was the primary endpoint of the study.
12545,"While none (0 of 6) of the saline group survived, 83–100% of infected monkeys survived when treatment was initiated 1, 24, 48, or 96 h post-infection (PI)."
12546,The antisense treatment also reduced serum viremia and inflammatory cytokines in all treatment groups compared to vehicle controls.
12547,The antibody immune response to virus was preserved and tissue viral antigen was cleared in AVI-7288 treated animals.
12548,These data show that AVI-7288 protects NHPs against an otherwise lethal MARV infection when treatment is initiated up to 96 h PI.
12549, We have completed the genetic characterization of all eight gene segments for four low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses.
12550,The objective of this study was to detect the presence of novel signatures that may serve as early warning indicators of the conversion of LPAI viruses to high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses.
12551,This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 viruses that were isolated from live poultry imported into Singapore as part of the national avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance program.
12552,"Based on the molecular criterion of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), sequence analysis with the translated amino acid (aa) sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed the absence of multibasic aa at the HA cleavage site, identifying all four virus isolates as LPAI."
12553,"Detailed phylogenetic tree analyses using the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes clustered these isolates in the Eurasian H5 lineage, but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes."
12554,"This analysis further revealed that the internal genes clustered to different avian and swine subtypes, suggesting that the four isolates may possibly share their ancestry with these different influenza subtypes."
12555,"Our results suggest that the four LPAI isolates in this study contained mainly avian signatures, and the phylogenetic tree for the internal genes further suggests the potential for reassortment with other different circulating avian subtypes."
12556,This is the first comprehensive report on the genetic characterization of LPAI H5N2/3 viruses isolated in South-East Asia.
12557," Aminopeptidase N, or CD13, is a receptor for serologically related coronaviruses of humans, pigs, and cats."
12558,A mouse line transgenic for the receptor of human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) was created using human APN (hAPN) cDNA driven by a hAPN promoter.
12559,"hAPN-transgenic mice expressed hAPN mRNA in the kidney, small intestine, liver, and lung."
12560,"hAPN protein was specifically expressed on epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted renal tubules, bronchi, alveolar sacs, and intestinal villi."
12561,The hAPN expression pattern within transgenic mouse tissues matched that of mouse APN and was similar in mice heterozygous or homozygous for the transgene.
12562,Primary embryonic cells and bone marrow dendritic cells derived from hAPN-transgenic mice also expressed hAPN protein.
12563,"Although hAPN-transgenic mice were resistant to HCoV-229E in vivo, primary embryonic cells and bone marrow dendritic cells were infected in vitro."
12564,hAPN-transgenic mice are valuable as a source of primary mouse cells expressing hAPN.
12565,"This hAPN-transgenic line will also be used for crossbreeding experiments with other knockout, immune deficient, or transgenic mice to identify factors, in addition to hAPN, that are required for HCoV-229E infection."
12566," Currently, there is no registered treatment for infections with emerging zoonotic coronaviruses like SARS- and MERS-coronavirus."
12567,"We here report that in cultured cells low-micromolar concentrations of alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A-analog, inhibit the replication of four different coronaviruses, including MERS- and SARS-coronavirus."
12568,"Ribavirin was found to further potentiate the antiviral effect of alisporivir in these cell culture-based infection models, but this combination treatment was unable to improve the outcome of SARS-CoV infection in a mouse model."
12569,"Nevertheless, our data provide a basis to further explore the potential of Cyp inhibitors as host-directed, broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus replication."
12570,"To identify environmental sites commonly contaminated by avian influenza virus A (H5N1) in live-bird markets in Indonesia, we investigated 83 markets in 3 provinces in Indonesia."
12571,"At each market, samples were collected from up to 27 poultry-related sites to assess the extent of contamination."
12572,Samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription–PCR and virus isolation.
12573,"A questionnaire was used to ascertain types of birds in the market, general infrastructure, and work practices."
12574,Thirty-nine (47%) markets showed contamination with avian influenza virus in >1 of the sites sampled.
12575,Risk factors were slaughtering birds in the market and being located in West Java province.
12576,Protective factors included daily removal of waste and zoning that segregated poultry-related work flow areas.
12577,"These results can aid in the design of evidence-based programs concerning environmental sanitation, food safety, and surveillance to reduce the risk for avian influenza virus A (H5N1) transmission in live-bird markets."
12578,6 Viral Etiology of Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis
12579,"The first reports of astroviruses in animals date back to the end of the 1970s, when infections in mammals such as lambs and calves suffering from diarrhea were reported for the first time."
12580,"Since then, several mammalian species have been shown to be susceptible to astroviruses which appear to be genetically diverse and to have acquired host-specificity."
12581,"To date, astroviruses have been detected in 16 different orders or species of mammals in addition to humans, and signs of infection range from unapparent infection or very mild disease to diarrhea, lethargy, and anorexia, mainly observed in young individuals."
12582,"This chapter describes those astroviruses detected in nonhuman mammalian species worldwide, as well as their molecular and phenotypic characteristics and their role in diseases."
12583,The capacity of these viruses to cross-species barriers and their subsequent adaptation to novel hosts is also highlighted.
12584, Objective Newly identified human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) and human bocavirus (HBoV) cannot propagate in vitro in traditional cell culture models; thus obtaining knowledge about these viruses and developing related vaccines are difficult.
12585,"Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel platform for the propagation of these types of viruses."
12586,Methods A platform for culturing human airway epithelia in a three-dimensional (3D) pattern using Matrigel as scaffold was developed.
12587,The features of 3D culture were identified by immunochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy.
12588,Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV in 3D cells at designated time points were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
12589,"Levels of cytokines, whose secretion was induced by the viruses, were measured by ELISA."
12590,"Results Properties of bronchial-like tissues, such as the expression of biomarkers CK5, ZO-1, and PCK, and the development of cilium-like protuberances indicative of the human respiration tract, were observed in 3D-cultured human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, but not in monolayer-cultured cells."
12591,Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV and levels of virus-induced cytokines were also measured using the 3D culture system.
12592,Conclusion Our data provide a preliminary indication that the 3D culture model of primary epithelia using a Matrigel scaffold in vitro can be used to propagate HRV-C and HBoV.
12593,": Many RNA viruses arise from animal reservoirs, namely bats, rodents and insectivores but mechanisms of virus maintenance and transmission still need to be addressed."
12594,The bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) has recently been identified as reservoir of the neurotropic Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1).
12595,PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six out of eleven wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews were trapped and revealed to be naturally infected with BoDV-1.
12596,All shrews were monitored in captivity in a long-term study over a time period up to 600 days that differed between the individual shrews.
12597,"Interestingly, all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction."
12598,"Infectious virus and viral RNA were demonstrated in saliva, urine, skin swabs, lacrimal fluid and faeces, both during the first 8 weeks of the investigation period and for long time shedding after more than 250 days in captivity."
12599,CONCLUSIONS: The various ways of shedding ensure successful virus maintenance in the reservoir population but also transmission to accidental hosts such as horses and sheep.
12600,Naturally BoDV-1-infected living shrews serve as excellent tool to unravel host and pathogen factors responsible for persistent viral co-existence in reservoir species while maintaining their physiological integrity despite high viral load in many organ systems.
12601," Susceptible BALB/c mice, after experimental infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3), revealed virus titres in the liver that increased gradually to a peak of 8 × 105 PFU/g of tissue after 3 days' infection, when the mice died of acute hepatitis."
12602,"BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with 35S-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis."
12603,"Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity."
12604,"We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs."
12605,The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins.
12606,"Whether these proteins are a result of a defence attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown."
12607,Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have had considerable success at crossing species barriers; both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 have been transmitted on multiple occasions from SIV-infected natural host species.
12608,"However, the precise evolutionary and ecological mechanisms characterizing a successful cross-species transmission event remain to be elucidated."
12609,"Here, in addition to expanding and clarifying our previous description of the adaptation of a diverse, naturally occurring SIVsm inoculum to a new rhesus macaque host, we present an analytical framework for understanding the selective forces driving viral adaptation to a new host."
12610,A preliminary analysis of large-scale changes in virus population structure revealed that viruses replicating in the macaques were subject to increasing levels of selection through day 70 postinfection (p.i.
12611,"), whereas contemporaneous viruses in the mangabeys remained similar to the source inoculum."
12612,Three different site-by-site methods were employed to identify the amino acid sites responsible for this macaque-specific selection.
12613,"Of 124 amino acid sites analyzed, 3 codons in V2, a 2–amino acid shift in an N-linked glycosylation site, and variation at 2 sites in the highly charged region were consistently evolving under either directional or diversifying selection at days 40 and 70 p.i."
12614,This strong macaque-specific selection on the V2 loop underscores the importance of this region in the adaptation of SIVsm to rhesus macaques.
12615,"Due to the extreme viral diversity already extant in the naturally occurring viral inoculum, we employed a broad range of phylogenetic and numerical tools in order to distinguish the signatures of past episodes of selection in viral sequences from more recent selection pressures."
12616,"Hendra virus (HeV) infection in humans is characterized by an influenza like illness, which may progress to pneumonia or encephalitis and lead to death."
12617,"The pathogenesis of HeV infection is poorly understood, and the lack of a mouse model has limited the opportunities for pathogenetic research."
12618,"In this project we reassessed the role of mice as an animal model for HeV infection and found that mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure, with aged mice reliably developing encephalitic disease."
12619,"We propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain, possibly along olfactory nerves."
12620,This is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals.
12621,In our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models.
12622,"These studies report a new animal model of HeV encephalitis that will allow more detailed studies of the neuropathogenesis of HeV infection, particularly the mode of viral spread and possible sequestration within the central nervous system; investigation of mechanisms that moderate the development of viremia and systemic disease; and inform the development of improved treatment options for human patients."
12623, Many theoretical studies have proposed different causal mechanisms by which the structure of a host population could have important implications for life history traits of pathogens.
12624,"However, little information is available from real systems to test these hypotheses."
12625,"The domestic cat, Felis silvestris catus, whose populations exhibit a great variability in social and spatial structure, represent an ideal case study to assess this question."
12626,"In the present article, we show how cat population structure may have influenced the evolution of feline viruses and, in return, how these viruses may have modified the genetic structure of cat populations."

12628,"Background The threat posed by swine influenza viruses with potential to transmit from pig populations to other hosts, including humans, requires the development of new experimental systems to study different aspects of influenza infection."
12629,Ex vivo organ culture (EVOC) systems have been successfully used in the study of both human and animal respiratory pathogens.
12630,Objectives We aimed to develop an air interface EVOC using pig tracheas in the study of influenza infection demonstrating that tracheal explants can be effectively maintained in organ culture and support productive influenza infection.
12631,Methods Tracheal explants were maintained in the air interface EVOC system for 7 days.
12632,Histological characteristics were analysed with different staining protocols and co‐ordinated ciliary movement on the epithelial surface was evaluated through a bead clearance assay.
12633,Explants were infected with a swine H1N1 influenza virus.
12634,Influenza infection of epithelial cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and viral replication was quantified by plaque assays and real‐time RT‐PCR.
12635,"Results Histological analysis and bead clearance assay showed that the tissue architecture of the explants was maintained for up to 7 days, while ciliary movement exhibited a gradual decrease after 4 days."
12636,Challenge with swine H1N1 influenza virus showed that the EVOC tracheal system shows histological changes consistent with in vivo influenza infection and supported productive viral replication over multiple cycles of infection.
12637,Conclusion The air interface EVOC system using pig trachea described here constitutes a useful biological tool with a wide range of applications in the study of influenza infection.
12638,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the causative agent of a severe respiratory disease associated with more than 2468 human infections and over 851 deaths in 27 countries since 2012.
12639,"There are no approved treatments for MERS-CoV infection although a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFNb) is currently being evaluated in humans in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
12640,"Here, we show that remdesivir (RDV) and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and RTV in vitro."
12641,"In mice, both prophylactic and therapeutic RDV improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology."
12642,"In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb slightly reduces viral loads without impacting other disease parameters."
12643,Therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improves pulmonary function but does not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology.
12644,"Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential for RDV to treat MERS-CoV infections."
12645,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged in the Middle East.
12646,"Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate."
12647,"Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated."
12648,We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding.
12649,Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication.
12650,"Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals."
12651,"Despite increased viral replication, pathology in the lungs was significantly lower in immunosuppressed animals."
12652,The observation that the virus was less pathogenic in these animals suggests that disease has an immunopathogenic component and shows that inflammatory responses elicited by the virus contribute to disease.
12653,Coronavirus host and cell specificities are determined by specific interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and host cell receptor(s).
12654,"Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis (IBV) has been adapted to embryonated chicken eggs, primary chicken kidney (CK) cells, monkey kidney cell line Vero, and other human and animal cells."
12655,Here we report that acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity by amino acid mutations in the S protein determines the infectivity of IBV in cultured cells.
12656,Expression of S protein derived from Vero- and CK-adapted strains showed efficient induction of membrane fusion.
12657,"However, expression of S protein cloned from the third passage of IBV in chicken embryo (EP3) did not show apparent syncytia formation."
12658,"By construction of chimeric S constructs and site-directed mutagenesis, a point mutation (L857-F) at amino acid position 857 in the heptad repeat 1 region of S protein was shown to be responsible for its acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity."
12659,"Furthermore, a G405-D point mutation in the S1 domain, which was acquired during further propagation of Vero-adapted IBV in Vero cells, could enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the protein."
12660,Re-introduction of L857 back to the S gene of Vero-adapted IBV allowed recovery of variants that contain the introduced L857.
12661,"However, compensatory mutations in S1 and some distant regions of S2 were required for restoration of the cell–cell fusion activity of S protein carrying L857 and for the infectivity of the recovered variants in cultured cells."
12662,This study demonstrates that acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity in S protein determines the selection and/or adaptation of a coronavirus from chicken embryo to cultured cells of human and animal origins.
12663,A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC/2012) was isolated from a man with acute pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012.
12664,"This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses."
12665,"The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs."
12666,"Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus."
12667,"In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus."
12668,"HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain."
12669,HCoV-EMC/2012 is the sixth coronavirus known to infect humans and the first human virus within betacoronavirus lineage C.
12670,"Zoonoses are a worldwide public health concern, accounting for approximately 75% of human infectious diseases."
12671,"In addition, zoonoses adversely affect agricultural production and wildlife."
12672,We review some mathematical models developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and identify areas where further modeling efforts are needed.
12673,"When pathogens become airborne, they travel associated with particles of different size and composition."
12674,"Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen."
12675,"Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown."
12676,"In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range."
12677,Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (μm) in diameter).
12678,"Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m(3) within each size range."
12679,IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10(2) (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1μm) to 4.3x10(5) RNA copies/m(3) in the largest particles (9.0–10.0μm).
12680,PRRSV was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1μm in quantities ranging from 6x10(2) (0.4–0.7μm) to 5.1x10(4) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm).
12681,"PEDV, an enteric virus, was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than IAV and PRRSV (p < 0.0001) ranging from 1.3x10(6) (0.4–0.7μm) to 3.5x10(8) RNA copies/m(3) (9.0–10.0μm)."
12682,"Infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses, and in the case of IAV and PRRSV, viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1μm."
12683,"In summary, our results indicated that airborne PEDV, IAV and PRRSV can be found in a wide range of particle sizes."
12684,"However, virus viability is particle size dependent."
12685,"In Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, an animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), axonal injury precedes inflammatory demyelinating lesions, and the distribution of axonal damage present during the early phase of infection corresponds to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase."
12686,"We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination."
12687,"Three weeks after TMEV infection, axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve."
12688,Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection.
12689,"Control mice, infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi."
12690,Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions.
12691,"In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi."
12692,We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups.
12693,This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment.
12694,"In this scenario, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model)."
12695,Neurotropic viruses infect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause acute or chronic neurologic disabilities.
12696,"Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role for immune homeostasis, but may inhibit pathogen-specific immunity in infectious disorders."
12697,The present review summarizes the current knowledge about Treg in human CNS infections and their animal models.
12698,"Besides dampening pathogen-induced immunopathology, Treg have the ability to facilitate protective responses by supporting effector T cell trafficking to the infection site and the development of resident memory T cells."
12699,"Moreover, Treg can reduce virus replication by inducing apoptosis of infected macrophages and attenuate neurotoxic astrogliosis and pro-inflammatory microglial responses."
12700,"By contrast, detrimental effects of Treg are caused by suppression of antiviral immunity, allowing for virus persistence and latency."
12701,"Opposing disease outcomes following Treg manipulation in different models might be attributed to differences in technique and timing of intervention, infection route, genetic background, and the host’s age."
12702,"In addition, mouse models of virus-induced demyelination revealed that Treg are able to reduce autoimmunity and immune-mediated CNS damage in a disease phase-dependent manner."
12703,Understanding the unique properties of Treg and their complex interplay with effector cells represents a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic approaches in neurotropic virus infections.
12704," The 31st International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) was held in Porto, Portugal from June 11–15, 2018."
12705,"In this report, volunteer rapporteurs provide their summaries of scientific presentations, hoping to effectively convey the speakers' goals and the results and conclusions of their talks."
12706,"This report provides an overview of the invited keynote and award lectures and highlights of short oral presentations, from the perspective of experts in antiviral research."
12707,"Of note, a session on human cytomegalovirus included an update on the introduction to the clinic of letermovir for the prevention of CMV infection and disease."
12708,The 31st ICAR successfully promoted new discoveries in antiviral research and drug development.
12709,"The 32nd ICAR will be held in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, May 6–10, 2019."
12710,"Rocio virus (ROCV) is a highly neuropathogenic mosquito-transmitted flavivirus responsible for an unprecedented outbreak of human encephalitis during 1975–1976 in Sao Paulo State, Brazil."
12711,"Previous studies have shown an increased number of inflammatory macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) of ROCV-infected mice, implying a role for macrophages in the pathogenesis of ROCV."
12712,"Here, we show that ROCV infection results in increased expression of CCL2 in the blood and in infiltration of macrophages into the brain."
12713,"Moreover, we show, using CCR2 knockout mice, that CCR2 expression is essential for macrophage infiltration in the brain during ROCV infection and that the lack of CCR2 results in increased disease severity and mortality."
12714,"Thus, our findings show the protective role of CCR2-mediated infiltration of macrophages in the brain during ROCV infection."
12715,  This chapter presents the history of viral immunology.
12716,The use of viral components for vaccination has been the subject of experimental clinical trials with adenoviruses and influenza subunit vaccines are in current use.
12717,"The effect of the production of antibodies against viral components during the course of infection is in vivo complement fixation, demonstrable in practice by the developing anti-complementary activity of serum."
12718,"Other antibody reactions, which may or may not result in neutralization of infectivity, may play an important role in the production of lesions, especially in certain persistent viral infections."
12719,"Immune complexes in which viral antigens rather than virions are involved may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of some acute infections, such as hemorrhagic dengue and in the glomerulonephritis found in several chronic viral infections."
12720,"Indeed, antigenemia and the early formation of immune complexes, rather than viremia as such, may provide the pathogenetic basis for the fever and symptoms that mark the end of the incubation period in many generalized viral infections and the prodromal rash may have a similar explanation."
12721,This article compares the treatment of living beings (unvaccinated chickens and infected cells) considered as sentinel devices in a farm and in a lab in Hong Kong.
12722,Sentinel devices are defined as living beings posted on a boundary from which they send signals of invisible threats.
12723,"The ethnography looks at how they transform differences between ordinary lives and lives exposed, between good death and bad death, through the practices of those who feed them."
12724,"In farms and labs exposed to Avian Influenza viruses, the logic of biosecurity intersects with a logic of care, blurring the distinction between self and other, friend and enemy through aesthetic judgments concerning what is a ‘good death’."
12725,Metabolism and immunity are redefined when sentinels are fed to produce clear signals of the mutations of viruses.
12726,Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been a significant research focus since its discovery in 2012.
12727,"Since 2012, 2,040 cases and 712 deaths have been recorded (as of August 11, 2017), representing a strikingly high case fatality rate of 36%."
12728,"Over the last several years, MERS-CoV research has progressed in several parallel and complementary directions."
12729,"This review will focus on three particular areas: the origins and evolution of MERS-CoV, the challenges and achievements in the development of MERS-CoV animal models, and our understanding of how novel proteins unique to MERS-CoV counter the host immune response."
12730,"The origins of MERS-CoV, likely in African bats, are increasingly clear, although important questions remain about the establishment of dromedary camels as a reservoir seeding human outbreaks."
12731,"Likewise, there have been important advances in the development of animal models, and both non-human primate and mouse models that seem to recapitulate human disease are now available."
12732,How MERS-CoV evades and inhibits the host innate immune response remains less clear.
12733,"Although several studies have identified MERS-CoV proteins as innate immune antagonists, little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection, but rather with ectopically expressed proteins."
12734,"Accordingly, considerable space remains for major contributions to understanding unique ways in which MERS-CoV interacts with and modulates the host response."
12735,"Collectively, these areas have seen significant advances over the last several years but continue to offer exciting opportunities for discovery."
12736,"Ferrets are the preferred animal model to assess influenza virus infection, virulence and transmission as they display similar clinical symptoms and pathogenesis to those of humans."
12737,"Measures of disease severity in the ferret include weight loss, temperature rise, sneezing, viral shedding and reduced activity."
12738,"To date, the only available method for activity measurement has been the assignment of an arbitrary score by a ‘blind’ observer based on pre-defined responsiveness scale."
12739,This manual scoring method is subjective and can be prone to bias.
12740,"In this study, we described a novel video-tracking methodology for determining activity changes in a ferret model of influenza infection."
12741,"This method eliminates the various limitations of manual scoring, which include the need for a sole ‘blind’ observer and the requirement to recognise the ‘normal’ activity of ferrets in order to assign relative activity scores."
12742,"In ferrets infected with an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, video-tracking was more sensitive than manual scoring in detecting ferret activity changes."
12743,"Using this video-tracking method, oseltamivir treatment was found to ameliorate the effect of influenza infection on activity in ferret."
12744,"Oseltamivir treatment of animals was associated with an improvement in clinical symptoms, including reduced inflammatory responses in the upper respiratory tract, lower body weight loss and a smaller rise in body temperature, despite there being no significant reduction in viral shedding."
12745,"In summary, this novel video-tracking is an easy-to-use, objective and sensitive methodology for measuring ferret activity."
12746," In contrast to adult mice, young AJ/mice, developed an acute hepatitis following infection with Mouse Hepatitis virus type 3."
12747,100 % of the young animals died 4 to 5 days after the infection and high levels of virus were found in the liver and peritoneal exudate.
12748,Very low levels of IFN-$#x03B3; were found in the serum and peritoneal exudate of infected young mice.
12749,This was in contrast to the levels observed in adult mice.
12750,"Spleen cells and macrophage cultures from young A/J mice, again in contrast to adult A/J mice, were shown to be unable to synthesize IFN-$#x03B3; and IFN-α/β respectively."
12751,"Macrophages from either young or adult A/J mice were able to be activated with exogenous recombinant IFN-$#x03B3; or IFN-α/β, enabling both sets of cells to restrict MHV3 replication."
12752,The results indicate that the ability of the immune system to synthesize IFN-$#x03B3; and IFN-α/β may playa major role in the age-dependent resistance of A/J mice to MHV3.
12753," The ferret is an excellent model for many human infectious diseases including influenza, SARS-CoV, henipavirus and pneumococcal infections."
12754,"The ferret is also used to study cystic fibrosis and various cancers, as well as reproductive biology and physiology."
12755,"However, the range of reagents available to measure the ferret immune response is very limited."
12756,"To address this deficiency, high-throughput real time RT-PCR TaqMan assays were developed to measure the expression of fifteen immune mediators associated with the innate and adaptive immune responses (IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12p40, IL17, Granzyme A, MCP1, TNFα), as well as four endogenous housekeeping genes (ATF4, HPRT, GAPDH, L32)."
12757,"These assays have been optimized to maximize reaction efficiency, reduce the amount of sample required (down to 1ng RNA per real time RT-PCR reaction) and to select the most appropriate housekeeping genes."
12758,"Using these assays, the expression of each of the tested genes could be detected in ferret lymph node cells stimulated with mitogens or infected with influenza virus in vitro."
12759,These new tools will allow a more comprehensive analysis of the ferret immune responses following infection or in other disease states.
12760,"A novel ultraviolet light irradiation (UV-C, 254 nm) process was designed as an additional safety feature for manufacturing of spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP)."
12761,In Exp.
12762,"1, three 10-L batches of bovine plasma were inoculated with 10(5.2±0.12) tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID(50)) of porcine parvovirus (PPV) per mL of plasma and subjected to UV-C ranging from 0 to 9180 J/L."
12763,No viable PPV was detected in bovine plasma by micro-titer assay in SK6 cell culture after UV-C at 2295 J/L.
12764,In Exp.
12765,"2, porcine plasma was subjected to UV-C (3672 J/L), then spray dried and mixed in complete mash diets."
12766,"Diets were a control without SDPP (Control), UV-C SDPP either at 3% (UVSDPP3) or 6% (UVSDPP6) and non-UV-C SDPP at 3% (SDPP3) or 6% (SDPP6)."
12767,Diets were fed ad libitum to 320 weaned pigs (26 d of age; 16 pens/diet; 4 pigs/pen) for 14 d after weaning and a common diet was fed d 15 to 28.
12768,"During d 0 to 14, pigs fed UVSDPP3, UVSDPP6, or SDPP6 had higher (P < 0.05) weight gain and feed intake than control."
12769,"During d 0 to 28, pigs fed UVSDPP3 and UVSDPP6 had higher (P < 0.05) weight gain and feed intake than control and SDPP3, and SDPP6 had higher (P < 0.05) feed intake than control."
12770,"Also, pigs fed UVSDPP had higher (P < 0.05) weight gain than pigs fed SDPP."
12771,"In conclusion, UV-C inactivated PPV in liquid plasma and UVSDPP used in pig feed had no detrimental effects on pig performance."
12772,The distribution of multi-host pathogens over their host range conditions their population dynamics and structure.
12773,"Also, host co-infection by different pathogens may have important consequences for the evolution of hosts and pathogens, and host-pathogen co-evolution."
12774,"Hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random, or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens, or between pathogens sharing a host."
12775,"To analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens, and for the observed patterns of co-infection, and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations."
12776,"Applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations: most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts, respectively."
12777,"Interestingly, the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones, suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens."
12778,Analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts.
12779,"The developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens, which will help to understand and model the population biology of multi-host pathogens."
12780,"Coronaviruses are widespread in the environment, infecting humans, domesticated and wild mammals, and birds."
12781,"Infections cause a variety of diseases including bronchitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and encephalitis, with symptoms ranging from being nearly undetectable to rapidly fatal."
12782,"A combination of interacting variables determine the pattern and severity of coronavirus-induced disease, including the infecting virus strain, its transmission strategy, and the age and immune status of the infected host."
12783,Coronavirus pathogenesis is best understood by discerning how each of these variables dictates clinical outcomes.
12784,This chapter focuses on variabilities amongst the spike (S) proteins of infecting virus strains.
12785,"Diversity of coronavirus surface proteins likely contributes to epidemic disease, an important and timely topic given the recent emergence of the human SARS coronavirus."
12786, The effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on neuropathological lesions induced by a chronic viral infection have been tested in the experimental model of the mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection.
12787,"Daily injections of CsA (50 mg/kg) inhibited the expression of the MHV3-induced ependymitis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and vasculitis."
12788,The effect was preserved even if CsA treatment was initiated 15 days after virus infection but was lost if CsA treatment was given later on or for a shorter period of time.
12789,Viral titers in brains of chronically infected mice were not affected by CsA treatment.
12790,"During the first week following MHV3 infection, CsA treatment increased both the percentage of acute death (31 vs. 10%) and the viral titers in brain and liver of infected mice."
12791,"In this model, the timing of CsA treatment appeared critical for the balance between its beneficial effect on CNS lesions and the risk of increased acute mortality."
12792, Human and animal models continue to play a crucial role in research to understand host immunity to rhinovirus (RV) and identify disease mechanisms.
12793,Human models have provided direct evidence that RV infection is capable of exacerbating chronic respiratory diseases and identified immunological processes that correlate with clinical disease outcomes.
12794,Mice are the most commonly used nonhuman experimental RV infection model.
12795,"Although semipermissive, under defined experimental conditions sufficient replication occurs to induce host immune responses that recapitulate immunity and disease during human infection."
12796,The capacity to use genetically modified mouse strains and drug interventions has shown the mouse model to be an invaluable research tool defining causal relationships between host immunity and disease and supporting development of new treatments.
12797,Used in combination the insights achieved from human and animal experimental infection models provide complementary insights into RV biology and yield novel therapeutic options to reduce the burden of RV-induced disease.
12798, Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is an arterivirus that naturally infects species of African nonhuman primates causing acute or persistent asymptomatic infections.
12799,"Although it was previously estimated that 1% of baboons are SHFV-positive, more than 10% of wild-caught and captive-bred baboons tested were SHFV positive and the infections persisted for more than 10 years with detectable virus in the blood (100–1000 genomes/ml)."
12800,"The sequences of two baboon SHFV isolates that were amplified by a single passage in primary macaque macrophages had a high degree of identity to each other as well as to the genome of SHFV-LVR, a laboratory strain isolated in the 1960s."
12801,"Infection of Japanese macaques with 100PFU of a baboon isolate consistently produced high level viremia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, elevated tissue factor levels and clinical signs indicating coagulation defects."
12802,The baboon virus isolate provides a reliable BSL2 model of viral hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques.
12803, Research studies of infectious disease outbreaks in wild species of the cat family Felidae have revealed unusual details regarding forces that shape population survival and genetic resistance in these species.
12804,"A highly virulent feline coronavirus epidemic in African cheetahs, a disease model for human SARS, illustrates the critical role of ancestral population genetic variation."
12805,"Widespread prevalence of species specific feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a relative of HIV–AIDS, occurs with little pathogenesis in felid species, except in domestic cats, suggesting immunological adaptation in species where FIV is endemic."
12806,Resolving the interaction of host and pathogen genomes can shed new light on the process of disease outbreak in wildlife and in humankind.
12807,The role of disease in endangered populations and species is difficult to access as opportunities to monitor outbreaks in natural populations are limited.
12808,Conservation management may benefit greatly from advances in molecular genetic tools developed for human biomedical research to assay the biodiversity of both host species and emerging pathogen.
12809,"As these examples illustrate, strong parallels exist between disease in human and endangered wildlife and argue for an integration of the research fields of comparative genomics, infectious disease, epidemiology, molecular genetics and population biology for an effective proactive conservation approach."
12810,The Caliciviridae family of small positive sense RNA viruses contains a diverse range of pathogens of both man and animals.
12811,The molecular mechanisms of calicivirus genome replication and translation have not been as widely studied as many other RNA viruses.
12812,"With the relatively recent development of robust cell culture and reverse genetics systems for several members of the Caliciviridae family, a more in-depth analysis of the finer detail of the viral life cycle has now been obtained."
12813,"As a result, the identification and characterization of the role of RNA structures in the calicivirus life cycle has also been possible."
12814,This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge with respect to the role of RNA structures at the termini of calicivirus genomes.
12815,The 2013–2016 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in West Africa was of unprecedented magnitude and changed our perspective on this lethal but sporadically emerging virus.
12816,This outbreak also marked the beginning of large-scale real-time molecular epidemiology.
12817,"Herein, we show how evolutionary analyses of Ebola virus genome sequences provided key insights into virus origins, evolution, and spread during the epidemic."
12818,"We provide basic scientists, epidemiologists, medical practitioners, and other outbreak responders with an enhanced understanding of the utility and limitations of pathogen genomic sequencing."
12819,This will be crucially important in our attempts to track and control future infectious disease outbreaks.
12820,"Despite high similarity of canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), bovine coronavirus, (BCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), these viruses differ in species specificity."
12821,"For years it was believed that they share receptor specificity, utilizing sialic acids for cell surface attachment, internalization, and entry."
12822,"Interestingly, careful literature analysis shows that viruses indeed bind to the cell surface via sialic acids, but there is no solid data that these moieties mediate virus entry."
12823,"In our study, using a number of techniques, we showed that all three viruses are indeed able to bind to sialic acids to a different extent, but these molecules render the cells permissive only for the clinical strain of HCoV-OC43, while for others they serve only as attachment receptors."
12824,CRCoV and BCoV appear to employ human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-1) as the entry receptor.
12825,"Furthermore, we identified heparan sulfate as an alternative attachment factor, but this may be related to the cell culture adaptation, as in ex vivo conditions, it does not seem to play a significant role."
12826,"Summarizing, we delineated early events during CRCoV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43 entry and systematically studied the attachment and entry receptor utilized by these viruses."
12827,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the most relevant causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
12828,Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models.
12829,"The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology."
12830,"We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species)."
12831,"Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)."
12832,"Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study."
12833,"210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats."
12834,"The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together."
12835,"Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages."
12836,Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses.
12837,"Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively."
12838,"Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus."
12839,Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%).
12840,Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV.
12841," Phylogenetic analysis of SARS coronavirus isolates based on the spike gene and protein sequence using Neighbor-Joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods indicated that a recent human SARS-CoV isolate was closer to some human SARS-CoV isolates from earlier epidemic phase than to the SARS-CoV-like viruses isolated from wild animals during previous epidemic phase."
12842,A reasonable judgment based on phylogenetic relationship and sequence variations it is likely that the recent human SARS-CoV isolate is closer to an unknown SARS-CoV predecessor.
12843,Multipartitism counts amongst the weirdest lifestyles found in the virosphere.
12844,Multipartite viruses have genomes segmented in pieces enclosed in different capsids that are independently transmitted.
12845,"Since all segments have to meet in the host for complementation and completion of the viral cycle, multipartite viruses are bound to fight the loss of genomic information."
12846,"While this is an obvious disadvantage of this strategy, no consensus on its actual advantages has been reached."
12847,In this review we present an exhaustive summary of all multipartite viruses described to date.
12848,"Based on evidence, we discuss possible mechanistic and evolutionary origins of different groups, as well as their mutual relationships."
12849,We argue that the ubiquitous interactions of viruses with other unrelated viruses and with subviral elements might be regarded as a plausible first step towards multipartitism.
12850,"In agreement with the view of the Virosphere as a deeply entangled network of gene sharing, we contend that the power of multipartitism relies on its dynamical and opportunistic nature, because it enables immediate adaptive responses to environmental changes."
12851,"As such, perhaps the reasons for its success should be shought in multipartitism itself as an adaptive mechanism, to which its evolutionarily short-lived products (that is, the extant ensemble of multipartite viral species) are subordinated."
12852,We close by discussing how our understanding of multipartitism would improve by using concepts and tools from systems biology.
12853,"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide."
12854,"Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear."
12855,"Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice."
12856,"In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection."
12857,"Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88(−/−)), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection."
12858,The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.
12859,MyD88(−/−) mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.
12860,"Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88(−/−) mice compared to wild-type mice."
12861,"Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88(−/−)mice."
12862,These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.
12863,Molecular imaging has gained attention as a possible approach for the study of the progression of inflammation and disease dynamics.
12864,"Herein we used [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) as a radiotracer for PET imaging coupled with CT (FDG-PET/CT) to gain insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammatory response of ferrets infected with a clinical isolate of a pandemic influenza virus, H1N1 (H1N1pdm)."
12865,"The thoracic regions of mock- and H1N1pdm-infected ferrets were imaged prior to infection and at 1, 2, 3 and 6 days post-infection (DPI)."
12866,"On 1 DPI, FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed areas of consolidation in the right caudal lobe which corresponded with elevated [(18)F]-FDG uptake (maximum standardized uptake values (SUVMax), 4.7–7.0)."
12867,"By days 2 and 3, consolidation (CT) and inflammation ([(18)F]-FDG) appeared in the left caudal lobe."
12868,"By 6 DPI, CT images showed extensive areas of patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations with the largest lesions having high SUVMax (6.0–7.6)."
12869,"Viral shedding and replication were detected in most nasal, throat and rectal swabs and nasal turbinates and lungs on 1, 2 and 3 DPI, but not on day 7, respectively."
12870,"In conclusion, molecular imaging of infected ferrets revealed a progressive consolidation on CT with corresponding [(18)F]-FDG uptake."
12871,Strong positive correlations were measured between SUVMax and bronchiolitis-related pathologic scoring (Spearman’s ρ = 0.75).
12872,"Importantly, the extensive areas of patchy GGO and consolidation seen on CT in the ferret model at 6 DPI are similar to that reported for human H1N1pdm infections."
12873,"In summary, these first molecular imaging studies of lower respiratory infection with H1N1pdm show that FDG-PET can give insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammation in real-time."
12874,": Since rotavirus is one of the leading pathogens that cause severe gastroenteritis and represents a serious threat to human and animal health, researchers have been searching for cheap, safe, and effective anti-rotaviral drugs."
12875,"There is a widespread of interest in using natural products as antiviral agents, and among them, licorice derived from Glycyrrhiza spp."
12876,has exerted antiviral properties against several viruses.
12877,"In this study, anti-rotaviral efficacy of Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract (GUE) as an effective and cheaper remedy without side-effects was evaluated in colostrums-deprived piglets after induction of rotavirus diarrhea."
12878,METHODS: Colostrums-deprived piglets were inoculated with porcine rotavirus K85 (G5P[7]) strain.
12879,"On the onset of diarrhea, piglets were treated with different concentration of GUE."
12880,"To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of GUE, fecal consistency score, fecal virus shedding and histological changes of the small intestine, mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines (IL8, IL10, IFN-β, IFN-γ and TNF-α), signaling molecules (p38 and JNK), and transcription factor (NFκB) in the small intestine and spleen were determined."
12881,"RESULTS: Among the dosages (100-400 mg/ml) administrated to animals, 400 mg/ml of GUE cured diarrhea, and markedly improved small intestinal lesion score and fecal virus shedding."
12882,"mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines (IL8, IL10, IFN-β, IFN-γ and TNF-α), signaling molecules (p38 and JNK), and transcription factor (NFκB) in the small intestine and spleen were markedly increased in animals with RVA-induced diarrhea, but dose- dependently decreased in GUE treated animals after RVA-induced diarrhea."
12883,CONCLUSIONS: GUE cures rotaviral enteritis by coordinating antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects.
12884,Therapy of this herbal medicine can be a viable medication for curing rotaviral enteritis in animals and humans.
12885,HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are two of the four human coronaviruses that circulate worldwide.
12886,These two viruses are unique in their relationship towards each other.
12887,"Phylogenetically, the viruses are more closely related to each other than to any other human coronavirus, yet they only share 65% sequence identity."
12888,"Moreover, the viruses use different receptors to enter their target cell."
12889,"HCoV-NL63 is associated with croup in children, whereas all signs suggest that the virus probably causes the common cold in healthy adults."
12890,"HCoV-229E is a proven common cold virus in healthy adults, so it is probable that both viruses induce comparable symptoms in adults, even though their mode of infection differs."
12891,"Here, we present an overview of the current knowledge on both human coronaviruses, focusing on similarities and differences."
12892,Viruses and the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis
12893," While the 2002–2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in 774 deaths, patients who were affected with mild pulmonary symptoms successfully recovered."
12894,"The objective of the present work was to identify, using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse infection models, immune factors responsible for clearing of the virus."
12895,The elimination of pulmonary SARS-CoV infection required the activation of B cells by CD4+ T cells.
12896,"Furthermore, passive immunization (post-infection) with homologous (murine) anti-SARS-CoV antiserum showed greater elimination efficacy against SARS-CoV than that with heterologous (rabbit) antiserum, despite the use of equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies."
12897,"This distinction was mediated by mouse phagocytic cells (monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils), as demonstrated both by adoptive transfer from donors and by immunological depletion of selected cell types."
12898,These results indicate that the cooperation of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and phagocytic cells plays an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV.
12899, In the bovine synepitheliochorial placenta key sites of fetal–maternal interaction are placentomes consisting of maternal caruncles interdigitating with fetal cotyledons.
12900,"The aim of this study was to establish an epithelial cell line from caruncles of pregnant cows and to develop a model to study restricted trophoblast invasion, pathogenesis of pregnancy associated diseases and pathways of infection and transport."
12901,"Primary epithelial cells were isolated, successfully subcultured for 32 passages and cryopreserved at various stages."
12902,The cultures were termed bovine caruncular epithelial cell line-1 (BCEC-1).
12903,"Cytokeratin, zonula occludens-1 protein and vimentin but neither α-smooth muscle actin nor desmin were detected by immunofluorescence performed every 5 (±1) passages."
12904,These results were confirmed by Western blotting.
12905,"BCEC-1 were then cultured either without matrix or on fibronectin or collagen coated Transwell® polyester membrane inserts, respectively, enabling separate access to the basal or apical epithelial compartments."
12906,"Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of BCEC-1 revealed ultrastructural features also observed in vivo, such as apical microvilli and junctional complexes."
12907,Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured regularly and revealed an increase with advancing confluence in all cultures.
12908,Cultures on coated inserts reached confluence and corresponding TEER-levels at an earlier stage.
12909,"In addition, the cells were tested negative for bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) virus, but were permissive for the virus."
12910,"In conclusion, the BCEC-1 cell line retained characteristics of maternal caruncular epithelial cells as observed in vivo and in primary cell cultures and thus will be a highly useful tool for future studies of pathways of invasion, fetal–maternal communication, transport and infection."
12911,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, causes periodic outbreaks in livestocks and humans in countries of the African continent and Middle East."
12912,"RVFV NSs protein, a nonstructural protein, is a major virulence factor that exhibits several important biological properties."
12913,"These include suppression of general transcription, inhibition of IFN-β promoter induction and degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R. Although each of these biological functions of NSs are considered important for countering the antiviral response in the host, the individual contributions of these functions towards RVFV virulence remains unclear."
12914,"To examine this, we generated two RVFV MP-12 strain-derived mutant viruses."
12915,"Each carried mutations in NSs that specifically targeted its general transcription inhibition function without affecting its ability to degrade PKR and inhibit IFN-β promoter induction, through its interaction with Sin3-associated protein 30, a part of the repressor complex at the IFN-β promoter."
12916,"Using these mutant viruses, we have dissected the transcription inhibition function of NSs and examined its importance in RVFV virulence."
12917,Both NSs mutant viruses exhibited a differentially impaired ability to inhibit host transcription when compared with MP-12.
12918,"It has been reported that NSs suppresses general transcription by interfering with the formation of the transcription factor IIH complex, through the degradation of the p62 subunit and sequestration of the p44 subunit."
12919,"Our study results lead us to suggest that the ability of NSs to induce p62 degradation is the major contributor to its general transcription inhibition property, whereas its interaction with p44 may not play a significant role in this function."
12920,"Importantly, RVFV MP-12-NSs mutant viruses with an impaired general transcription inhibition function showed a reduced cytotoxicity in cell culture and attenuated virulence in young mice, compared with its parental virus MP-12, highlighting the contribution of NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition towards RVFV virulence."
12921,"In recent years, viruses have been recognized increasingly as an important cause of foodborne infections."
12922,"More than 160 enteric viruses are excreted in the feces of infected individuals, and some may also be present in the vomitus."
12923,"Food and water are directly contaminated with fecal material, through the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, sewage pollution of shellfish culture beds, or may be contaminated by infected food-handlers."
12924," Immunocompetent, but not RAG1−/− mice infected with MHV–JHM develop demyelination."
12925,"Transferred CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes reconstitute demyelination, and this ability is dependent on donor IFN-γ."
12926,We used IFN-γR1−/− mice to examine the target of IFN-γ in CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination.
12927,"In IFN-γR1−/−RAG1−/− recipients, demyelination is decreased, but not eliminated, while viral titers are significantly increased when compared to IFN-γR1+/+RAG1−/− recipients."
12928,IFN-γR1−/− CD8 T cells retain virus-specific effector function regardless of IFN-γR1 expression.
12929,"Although IFN-γR1 responsiveness is critical for maximal demyelination, increased levels of infectious virus coupled with adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells may result in myelin destruction independent of IFN-γR1 expression."
12930,"In this chapter we discuss the factors that contribute to the unique immunological environment of the central nervous system and the mechanisms that may account for the development of autoimmunity within the CNS, including infectious agents as inducers of autoimmune disease."
12931,"Consideration is given to a variety of human neurological diseases of autoimmune or presumed autoimmune etiology: autism, neuromyelitis optica, neuromyotonia, schizophrenia, lethargic encephalitis and stiff‐man syndrome."
12932,"Also, we discuss autoimmunity as a possible mediator of CNS repair and examples of the protective effects of bacterial and helminth infections on CNS disease."
12933,Multiple sclerosis and models of multiple sclerosis are discussed with special attention given to the Theiler's virus‐induced demyelination model.
12934,Advanced age is a risk factor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans.
12935,"To understand its pathogenesis, we developed an animal model using BALB/c mice and the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)."
12936,We examined the immune responses to SARS-CoV in both young and adult mice.
12937,"SARS-CoV induced severe respiratory illness in all adult, but not young, mice on day 2 after inoculation with a mortality rate of 30 to 50%."
12938,Moribund adult mice showed severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage accompanied by virus replication.
12939,"Adult murine lungs, which had significantly higher interleukin (IL)-4 and lower IL-10 and IL-13 levels before infection than young murine lungs, rapidly produced high levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines known to induce macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation (eg, tumor necrosis factor-α)."
12940,"On day 2 after inoculation, young murine lungs produced not only proinflammatory cytokines but also IL-2, interferon-γ, IL-10, and IL-13."
12941,"Adult mice showed early and acute excessive proinflammatory responses (ie, cytokine storm) in the lungs after SARS-CoV infection, which led to severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage."
12942,Intravenous injection with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibody 3 hours after infection had no effect on SARS-CoV infection.
12943,"However, intraperitoneal interferon-γ injection protected adult mice from the lethal respiratory illness."
12944,The experimental model described here may be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of SARS and for evaluating therapies to treat SARS-CoV infection.
12945,"Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the world’s largest rodents, are distributed throughout South America."
12946,These wild herbivores are commonly found near water bodies and are well adapted to rural and urban areas.
12947,There is limited information on the viruses circulating through capybaras.
12948,This study aimed to expand the knowledge on the viral diversity associated with capybaras by sampling their faeces.
12949,"Using a viral metagenomics approach, we identified diverse single-stranded DNA viruses in the capybara faeces sampled in the Distrito Federal, Brazil."
12950,A total of 148 complete genomes of viruses in the Microviridae family were identified.
12951,"In addition, 14 genomoviruses (family Genomoviridae), a novel cyclovirus (family Circoviridae), and a smacovirus (family Smacoviridae) were identified."
12952,"Also, 37 diverse viruses that cannot be assigned to known families and more broadly referred to as unclassified circular replication associated protein encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses were identified."
12953,This study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity associated with capybaras that may be infectious to these animals or associated with their microbiota or diet.
12954,"Respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract, mostly causing mild diseases."
12955,"However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.g., pneumonia)."
12956,Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes.
12957,"Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality."
12958,"For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS)."
12959,"Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases."
12960,"Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology)."
12961,The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified.
12962,Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood.
12963,"Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses."
12964," Infectious diseases impact African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), but the nature and magnitude of this threat likely varies among populations according to different factors, such as the presence and prevalence of pathogens and land-use characteristics."
12965,We systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk.
12966,"Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp."
12967,exposure.
12968,"Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but Babesia was never detected."
12969,"Exposure to CDV was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities."
12970,Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk.
12971,"Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an important role in CDV transmission dynamics."
12972,Relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs.
12973,"Should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination."
12974,"If prevention of CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity, control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy."
12975,The Coronaviridae family of viruses encompasses a group of pathogens with a zoonotic potential as observed from previous outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
12976,"Accordingly, it seems important to identify and document the coronaviruses in animal reservoirs, many of which are uncharacterized and potentially missed by more standard diagnostic assays."
12977,"A combination of sensitive deep sequencing technology and computational algorithms is essential for virus surveillance, especially for characterizing novel- or distantly related virus strains."
12978,"Here, we explore the use of profile Hidden Markov Model-defined Pfam protein domains (Pfam domains) encoded by new sequences as a Coronaviridae sequence classification tool."
12979,The encoded domains are used first in a triage to identify potential Coronaviridae sequences and then processed using a Random Forest method to classify the sequences to the Coronaviridae genus level.
12980,The application of this algorithm on Coronaviridae genomes assembled from agnostic deep sequencing data from surveillance of bats and rats in Dong Thap province (Vietnam) identified thirty-four Alphacoronavirus and eleven Betacoronavirus genomes.
12981,This collection of bat and rat coronaviruses genomes provided essential information on the local diversity of coronaviruses and substantially expanded the number of coronavirus full genomes available from bat and rats and may facilitate further molecular studies on this group of viruses.
12982,: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 affected global health and caused major economic disruption.
12983,Adequate animal models are required to study the underlying pathogenesis of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics.
12984,We report the first findings of measurable clinical disease in nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with SARS-CoV.
12985,"METHODS AND FINDINGS: In order to characterize clinically relevant parameters of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV in three groups: Group I was infected in the nares and bronchus, group II in the nares and conjunctiva, and group III intravenously."
12986,Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness.
12987,All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing antibodies.
12988,Chest radiographs from several animals in groups I and II revealed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 postinfection.
12989,Clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed.
12990,"Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation."
12991,Half of the group I animals were infected with a recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV derived from the SARS-CoV Urbani strain.
12992,This infectious clone produced disease indistinguishable from wild-type Urbani strain.
12993,"CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV infection of cynomolgus macaques did not reproduce the severe illness seen in the majority of adult human cases of SARS; however, our results suggest similarities to the milder syndrome of SARS-CoV infection characteristically seen in young children."
12994, The Syrian golden hamster is an attractive animal for research on infectious diseases and other diseases.
12995,"We report here the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the Syrian hamster transcriptome."
12996,We include transcripts from ten pooled tissues from a naïve hamster and one stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.
12997,"Our data set identified 42,707 non-redundant transcripts, representing 34,191 unique genes."
12998,"Based on the transcriptome data, we generated a custom microarray and used this new platform to investigate the transcriptional response in the Syrian hamster liver following intravenous adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) infection."
12999,"We found that Ad5 infection caused a massive change in regulation of liver transcripts, with robust up-regulation of genes involved in the antiviral response, indicating that the innate immune response functions in the host defense against Ad5 infection of the liver."
13000,The data and novel platforms developed in this study will facilitate further development of this important animal model.
13001, It is important to identify viruses in animals because most infectious diseases in humans are caused by viruses of zoonotic origin.
13002,African green monkey is a widely used non-human primate model in biomedical investigations.
13003,"In this study, total RNAs were extracted from stool samples of 10 African green monkeys with diarrhea."
13004,High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize viromes.
13005,PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the full genome sequences.
13006,Great viral diversity was observed.
13007,The dominant viruses were enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses.
13008,Six enterovirus genomes and a picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence were characterized.
13009,Five enteroviruses belonged to two putative new genotypes of species Enterovirus J.
13010,One enterovirus belonged to EV-A92.
13011,The picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence had the highest nucleotide similarity (93.48%) with human picobirnavirus isolate GPBV6C2.
13012,The present study helped to identify the potential zoonotic viruses in African green monkeys.
13013,Further investigations are required to elucidate their pathogenic roles in animals and humans.
13014,"Given the side effects of vaccination against infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), novel strategies for ILT control and therapy are urgently needed."
13015,"The modulation of host-virus interactions is a promising strategy to combat the virus; however, the interactions between the host and avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) are unclear."
13016,"Using genome-wide transcriptome studies in combination with a bioinformatic analysis, we identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) to be an important modulator of ILTV infection."
13017,Src controls the virulence of ILTV and is phosphorylated upon ILTV infection.
13018,Functional studies revealed that Src prolongs the survival of host cells by increasing the threshold of virus-induced cell death.
13019,"Therefore, Src is essential for viral replication in vitro and in ovo but is not required for ILTV-induced cell death."
13020,"Furthermore, our results identify a positive-feedback loop between Src and the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is necessary for the phosphorylation of either Src or FAK and is required for Src to modulate ILTV infection."
13021,"To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify a key host regulator controlling host-ILTV interactions."
13022,We believe that our findings have revealed a new potential therapeutic target for ILT control and therapy.
13023,"IMPORTANCE Despite the extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines starting from the mid-20th century and the administration of recombinant vaccines in recent years, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) outbreaks due to avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) occur worldwide annually."
13024,"Presently, there are no drugs or control strategies that effectively treat ILT."
13025,Targeting of host-virus interactions is considered to be a promising strategy for controlling ILTV infections.
13026,"However, little is known about the mechanisms governing host-ILTV interactions."
13027,The results from our study advance our understanding of host-ILTV interactions on a molecular level and provide experimental evidence that it is possible to control ILT via the manipulation of host-virus interactions.
13028,Extensive glycosylation of the envelope spikes of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) is an important factor for the resistance of these viruses to neutralization by antibodies.
13029,SIVmac239 gp41 has three closely spaced sites for N-linked carbohydrate attachment.
13030,"Rhesus macaques experimentally infected with mutant versions of SIVmac239 lacking two or three of these carbohydrate sites developed strong serum reactivity against mutated peptide sequences at the site of these glycosylations, as well as high titers of neutralizing activity to the mutant viruses (E. Yuste et al., J. Virol."
13031,"82:12472–12486, 2008)."
13032,"However, whether antibodies that recognize these underlying peptides have neutralizing activity has not been directly demonstrated."
13033,"Here we describe the isolation and characterization of three gp41-specific monoclonal antibodies (4G8, 6G8, and 7D6) from one of these mutant-infected monkeys."
13034,All three antibodies reacted with mutant gp41 from viral particles and also with peptides corresponding to mutated sequences.
13035,Slight differences in peptide specificities were observed among the three antibodies.
13036,"Sequence analysis revealed that the heavy chains of all three antibodies were derived from the same germ line heavy-chain segment (IGHV4-59*01), but they all had very different sequences in complementarity-determining region 3."
13037,The light chains of all three antibodies were very closely related to one another.
13038,"All three antibodies had neutralizing activity to mutant viruses deficient in gp41 carbohydrate attachment, but they did not neutralize the parental SIVmac239."
13039,These results demonstrate unambiguously that antibodies with specificity for peptide sequences underlying gp41 carbohydrates can effectively neutralize SIV when these carbohydrates are absent.
13040,"However, the presence of these gp41 carbohydrates effectively shields the virus from antibodies that would otherwise neutralize viral infectivity."
13041, Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease primarily affecting the central nervous system.
13042,"Of the many candidate polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC genes contributing to disease susceptibility, including those encoding effector (cytokines and chemokines) or receptor molecules within the immune system (MHC, TCR, Ig or FcR), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes have the most significant influence."
13043,In this article we put forward the hypothesis that the influence of HLA genes on the risk to develop MS is actually the sum of multiple antigen presenting cell (APC) and T-cell interactions involving HLA class I and class II molecules.
13044,"This article will also discuss that, because of the genetic and immunologic similarity to humans, autoimmune models of MS in non-human primates are the experimental models “par excellence” to test this hypothesis."
13045,"Small-animal models have been developed for several Filoviridae species; however, serial adaptation was required to produce lethal infection."
13046,"These adapted viruses have sequence changes in several genes, including those that modulate the host immune response."
13047,Nonhuman primate models do not require adaptation of filoviruses.
13048,"Here, we describe lethal models of disease for Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Zaire species of Ebolavirus in the domestic ferret, using wild-type nonadapted viruses."
13049,Pathologic features were consistent with disease in primates.
13050,"Of particular importance, this is the only known small-animal model developed for Bundibugyo and the only uniformly lethal animal model for Bundibugyo."
13051," Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that affects the central nervous system (CNS) white matter, and for which no effective cure exists."
13052,"Indeed, whether the primary event in MS pathology affects myelin or axons of the CNS remains unclear."
13053,Animal models are necessary to identify the immunopathological mechanisms involved in MS and to develop novel therapeutic and reparative approaches.
13054,"Specifically, viral models of chronic demyelination and axonal damage have been used to study the contribution of viruses in human MS, and they have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of MS pathology."
13055,"The Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model is one of the most commonly used MS models, although other viral models are also used, including neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce chronic inflammatory demyelination with similar histological features to those observed in MS."
13056,This review will discuss the immunopathological mechanisms involved in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD).
13057,The TMEV model reproduces a chronic progressive disease due to the persistence of the virus for the entire lifespan in susceptible mice.
13058,"The evolution and significance of the axonal damage and neuroinflammation, the importance of epitope spread from viral to myelin epitopes, the presence of abortive remyelination and the existence of a brain pathology in addition to the classical spinal cord demyelination, are some of the findings that will be discussed in the context of this TMEV-IDD model."
13059,"Despite their limitations, viral models remain an important tool to study the etiology of MS, and to understand the clinical and pathological variability associated with this disease."
13060, Genetic and environmental factors jointly determine the susceptibility to develop Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
13061,"Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility to MS."
13062,"Similar to other autoimmune diseases, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes."
13063,Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and for non-MHC regions.
13064,"The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been associated with MS development."
13065,"Current data suggest that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which predisposes for MS development."
13066,"In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS."
13067,One of the main goals of community ecology is to measure the relative importance of environmental filters to understand patterns of species distribution at different temporal and spatial scales.
13068,"Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission."
13069,"We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional)."
13070,The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA).
13071,"For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed."
13072,"This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased."
13073,Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales.
13074,"We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures."
13075,"At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures."
13076,"RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales."
13077,"Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale."
13078,The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis.
13079,"Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination."
13080,ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: Supplementary material is available for this article at 10.1556/168.2018.19.2.9 and is accessible for authorized users.
13081,"Canine circovirus (CanineCV) was detected, together with canine parvovirus (CPV), in samples from an outbreak of fatal gastroenteritis in dogs in Argentina."
13082,"We obtained the full-length genome of this recently discovered virus by overlapping PCR, designated strain UBA-Baires."
13083,Sequence analysis revealed a highly conserved genome but also showed several unique mutations in amino acids from the capsid protein that have not been previously reported.
13084,Phylogenetic analysis shows that this strain is more closely related to European strains than to viruses detected in North America or Asia.
13085,"Although the pathogenic role of CanineCV in dogs is still unclear, this study highlights the importance of CanineCV as a coinfecting virus in disease development."
13086,"To our knowledge, this is the first report of the involvement of CanineCV in severe clinical disease in dogs in South America."
13087,Our results expand our information on the geographical extent of this virus and contribute to the understanding of its role in disease.
13088,Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic disease seen exclusively in humans.
13089,Central nervous system (CNS) infection and neurological involvement have also been reported in CCHF.
13090,"In the current study, we inoculated NSG-SGM3 mice engrafted with human hematopoietic CD34(+) stem cells with low-passage CCHF virus strains isolated from human patients."
13091,"In humanized mice, lethal disease develops, characterized by histopathological change in the liver and brain."
13092,"To date, targets of neurological infection and disease have not been investigated in CCHF."
13093,"CNS disease in humanized mice was characterized by gliosis, meningitis, and meningoencephalitis, and glial cells were identified as principal targets of infection."
13094,"Humanized mice represent a novel lethal model for studies of CCHF countermeasures, and CCHF-associated CNS disease."
13095,Our data suggest a role for astrocyte dysfunction in neurological disease and identify key regions of infection in the CNS for future investigations of CCHF.
13096,New regulatory and consumer demands highlight the importance of animal feed as a part of our national food safety system.
13097,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food.
13098,"Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces."
13099,"A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment."
13100,Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
13101,"Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05)."
13102,Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing.
13103,"Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces."
13104,"Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer."
13105,A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity.
13106,"This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities."
13107,Viral pathogens have adapted to the host organism to exploit the cellular machinery for virus replication and to modulate the host cells for efficient systemic dissemination and immune evasion.
13108,Much of our knowledge of the effects that virus infections have on cells originates from in vitro imaging studies using experimental culture systems consisting of cell lines and primary cells.
13109,"Recently, intravital microscopy using multi-photon excitation of fluorophores has been applied to observe virus dissemination and pathogenesis in real-time under physiological conditions in living organisms."
13110,"Critical steps during viral infection and pathogenesis could be studied by direct visualization of fluorescent virus particles, virus-infected cells, and the immune response to viral infection."
13111,"In this review, I summarize the latest research on in vivo studies of viral infections using multi-photon intravital microscopy (MP-IVM)."
13112,"Initially, the underlying principle of multi-photon microscopy is introduced and experimental challenges during microsurgical animal preparation and fluorescent labeling strategies for intravital imaging are discussed."
13113,I will further highlight recent studies that combine MP-IVM with optogenetic tools and transcriptional analysis as a powerful approach to extend the significance of in vivo imaging studies of viral pathogens.
13114,"Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural hosts of several recently emerged zoonotic viruses of animal and human health significance in Australia and Asia, including Hendra and Nipah viruses."
13115,"Satellite telemetry was used on nine flying-foxes of three species (Pteropus alecto n = 5, P. vampyrus n = 2, and P. neohibernicus n = 2) to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region."
13116,"The animals were captured and released from six different locations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste."
13117,"Their movements were recorded for a median of 120 (range, 47–342) days with a median total distance travelled of 393 (range, 76–3011) km per individual."
13118,"Pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Western Province) on four occasions, between Papua New Guinea (Western Province) and Indonesia (Papua) on ten occasions, and to traverse Torres Strait on two occasions."
13119,Pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (West Timor) on one occasion.
13120,"These findings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by flying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of flying-fox populations in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sunda Islands."
13121,"Proof that a newly identified coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) came from a series of studies on experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis)."
13122,SARS-CoV-infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re-isolated from these animals and they developed SARS-CoV-specific antibodies.
13123,"This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS-CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS."
13124,"Besides the macaque model, a ferret and a cat model for SARS-CoV were also developed."
13125,These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS-CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies.
13126,"The first of these studies has shown that pegylated interferon-alpha, a drug approved for human use, limits SARS-CoV replication and lung damage in experimentally infected macaques."
13127,"Finally, we argue that, given the worldwide nature of the socio-economic changes that have predisposed for the emergence of SARS and avian influenza in Southeast Asia, such changes herald the beginning of a global trend for which we are ill prepared."
13128,The discovery of novel viruses in animals expands our knowledge of viral diversity and potentially emerging zoonoses.
13129,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology gives millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a comprehensive survey of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification."
13130,"In this study, we screened 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattles (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11) and monkeys (n = 20) using a HTS metagenomics approach."
13131,"The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a specimen from a Common Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii)."
13132,"It is about 7.5kb in length, with a G+C content of 45.8% and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs."
13133,"Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related."
13134,"Estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was approximately 60.2–91.9 millions of years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes."
13135,The estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from co-divergence because of possible host shifts.
13136,"As the nucleotide sequence of this virus only showed limited similarity with that of related animal PVs, the conventional approach of PCR using consensus primers would be unlikely to have detected the novel virus in the sample."
13137,"Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no apparent mucosal or skin lesions whereas RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus."
13138,We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the novel Dyolambda-papillomavirus genus.
13139,We earlier established a model of a persistent viral CNS infection using two week old immunologically normal (genetically unmodified) mice and recombinant measles virus (MV).
13140,"Using this model infection we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as regulators of the immune response in the brain, and assessed whether the persistent CNS infection can be modulated by manipulation of Tregs in the periphery."
13141,"CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs were expanded or depleted during the persistent phase of the CNS infection, and the consequences for the virus-specific immune response and the extent of persistent infection were analyzed."
13142,Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells predominantly recognising the H-2D(b)-presented viral hemagglutinin epitope MV-H(22–30) (RIVINREHL) were quantified in the brain by pentamer staining.
13143,Expansion of Tregs after intraperitoneal (i.p.)
13144,application of the superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody D665 inducing transient immunosuppression caused increased virus replication and spread in the CNS.
13145,"In contrast, depletion of Tregs using diphtheria toxin (DT) in DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells)-mice induced an increase of virus-specific CD8(+) effector T cells in the brain and caused a reduction of the persistent infection."
13146,These data indicate that manipulation of Tregs in the periphery can be utilized to regulate virus persistence in the CNS.
13147,"Besides being a common threat to farm animals and poultry, coronavirus (CoV) was responsible for the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002–4."
13148,"However, many aspects of CoV behavior, including modes of its transmission, are yet to be fully understood."
13149,We show that the amount and the peculiarities of distribution of the protein intrinsic disorder in the viral shell can be used for the efficient analysis of the behavior and transmission modes of CoV.
13150,The proposed model allows categorization of the various CoVs by the peculiarities of disorder distribution in their membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N).
13151,"This categorization enables quick identification of viruses with similar behaviors in transmission, regardless of genetic proximity."
13152,"Based on this analysis, an empirical model for predicting the viral transmission behavior is developed."
13153,This model is able to explain some behavioral aspects of important coronaviruses that previously were not fully understood.
13154,"The new predictor can be a useful tool for better epidemiological, clinical, and structural understanding of behavior of both newly emerging viruses and viruses that have been known for a long time."
13155,A potentially new vaccine strategy could involve searches for viral strains that are characterized by the evolutionary misfit between the peculiarities of the disorder distribution in their shells and their behavior.
13156,Filoviruses cause severe and fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans.
13157,Filovirus research has been extensive since the 2014 Ebola outbreak.
13158,"Due to their high pathogenicity and mortality, live filoviruses require Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) facilities, which have restricted the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs."
13159,An HIV-based pseudovirus cell infection assay is widely used for viral entry studies in BSL-2 conditions.
13160,"Here, we successfully constructed nine in vitro pseudo-filovirus models covering all filovirus genera and three in vivo pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models using Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lloviu virus as representative viruses."
13161,The pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed visualizing bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner.
13162,A bioluminescence peak in mice was reached on day 5 post-infection for Ebola virus and Marburg virus and on day 4 post-infection for Lloviu virus.
13163,"Two known filovirus entry inhibitors, clomiphene and toremiphene, were used to validate the model."
13164,"Collectively, our study shows that all genera of filoviruses can be well-pseudotyped and are infectious in vitro."
13165,The pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models can be used for in vivo activity evaluation of anti-filovirus drugs.
13166,This sequential in vitro and in vivo evaluation system of filovirus entry inhibitors provides a secure and efficient platform for screening and assessing anti-filovirus agents in BSL-2 facilities.
13167,"The gap junctions (GJs), which form intercellular communicating channels between two apposing cells or form hemichannel with extracellular environment, perform crucial functions to maintain small molecule homeostasis."
13168,The central nervous system (CNS) GJs are important for maintenance of myelin sheath and neuronal activity.
13169,Connexin (Cx) proteins are building blocks of GJs.
13170,"Recent cell-biological investigations show that amongst the CNS specific Cxs, the most abundant Cx protein, Cx43 and its oligodendrocytic coupling partner Cx47 primarily important for maintenance of CNS myelin."
13171,"Recent investigations elucidate that the expression of Cx43 and Cx47 is very important to maintain K+ buffering and nutrient homeostasis in oligodendrocytes, CNS myelin and oligodendrocyte function."
13172,The investigations on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient samples and EAE hypothesized that the functional loss of Cx43/Cx47 could be associated with spread of chronic MS lesions.
13173,"Exploring the mechanism of initial GJ alteration and its effect on demyelination in this model of MS might play a primary role to understand the basis of altered CNS homeostasis, observed during MS."
13174,"In this review, we mainly discuss the role of CNS GJs, specifically the Cx43/Cx47 axis in the perspective of demyelination."
13175,Emerging infectious diseases are a key threat to public health and the majority are caused by zoonotic pathogens.
13176,"Here we discuss new collaborative approaches to understanding the process of zoonotic disease emergence that link veterinary medicine, public health, and ecological approaches: conservation medicine and one health."
13177,"We demonstrate how studies on the underlying drivers of disease emergence (bushmeat hunting, wildlife trade, and deforestation) can provide ways to model, predict, and ultimately prevent zoonotic disease emergence and spread."
13178,Two polypeptide precursors to the neuropeptide substance P have recently been identified.
13179,"One of them (β-preprotachykinin) contains amino acid sequences corresponding not only to substance P but also to substance K, a novel, related peptide."
13180,"A third substance P-like peptide, neuromedin K, has recently been isolated from spinal cord."
13181,The existence in vertebrates of three members of the tachykinin family of peptides may account for pharmacological observations suggesting the presence of more than one type of substance P receptor in the nervous system.
13182,"Sudan virus (SUDV) outbreaks in Africa are highly lethal; however, the development and testing of novel antivirals and vaccines for this virus has been limited by a lack of suitable animal models."
13183,"Non-human primates (NHP) remain the gold standard for modeling filovirus disease, but they are not conducive to screening large numbers of experimental compounds and should only be used to test the most promising candidates."
13184,"Therefore, other smaller animal models are a valuable asset."
13185,We have recently developed a guinea-pig adapted SUDV virus that is lethal in guinea pigs.
13186,"In our current study, we show that ferrets are susceptible to wild-type SUDV, providing a small animal model to directly study clinical isolates, screen experimental anti-SUDV compounds and potentially study viral transmission."
13187,The lack of an animal model for human norovirus (HuNoV) has hindered the development of therapeutic strategies.
13188,"This study demonstrated that a commonly used cholesterol-lowering statin medication, simvastatin, which increases HuNoV replication in an in vitro replicon system, also enhances HuNoV infectivity in the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model."
13189,"In contrast, oral treatment with interferon (IFN)-α reduces HuNoV infectivity."
13190,"Young piglets, all with A or H1 histo-blood group antigens on enterocytes, were treated orally with 8 mg/kg/day of simvastatin; 5 days later, the pigs were inoculated orally with a GII.4 HuNoV (HS194/2009/US strain) and then treated with simvastatin for 5 more days."
13191,"Simvastatin induced significantly earlier onset and longer duration of HuNoV fecal shedding in treated pigs, frequently with higher fecal viral titers."
13192,"Simvastatin impaired poly (I:C)-induced IFN-α expression in macrophages or dendritic cells, possibly due to lowered toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expression; however, the mechanisms were not related to interferon regulatory factor 3 or nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway."
13193,"Thus, the enhanced, earlier infectivity of HuNoV in simvastatin-treated pigs coincided with the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on innate immunity."
13194,"In contrast to the increased HuNoV shedding that simvastatin induced, viral shedding during the treatment period was reduced or curtailed in the HuNoV-inoculated pigs pre-treated/treated with human IFN-α."
13195,Our findings are the first to indicate that IFN-α has potential as antiviral therapy against HuNoV.
13196,"Based on these intriguing and novel findings using the Gn pig model, we confirmed that HuNoV infectivity is altered by treatment with simvastatin or IFN-α."
13197,"Collectively, these findings indicate that Gn pigs are a useful model to test immunomodulators or efficacy of antivirals against HuNoV."
13198,The key to better understanding complex virus-host interactions is the utilization of robust three-dimensional (3D) human cell cultures that effectively recapitulate native tissue architecture and model the microenvironment.
13199,A lack of physiologically-relevant animal models for many viruses has limited the elucidation of factors that influence viral pathogenesis and of complex host immune mechanisms.
13200,"Conventional monolayer cell cultures may support viral infection, but are unable to form the tissue structures and complex microenvironments that mimic host physiology and, therefore, limiting their translational utility."
13201,The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor was designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to model microgravity and was later found to more accurately reproduce features of human tissue in vivo.
13202,"Cells grown in RWV bioreactors develop in a low fluid-shear environment, which enables cells to form complex 3D tissue-like aggregates."
13203,A wide variety of human tissues (from neuronal to vaginal tissue) have been grown in RWV bioreactors and have been shown to support productive viral infection and physiological meaningful host responses.
13204,"The in vivo-like characteristics and cellular features of the human 3D RWV-derived aggregates make them ideal model systems to effectively recapitulate pathophysiology and host responses necessary to conduct rigorous basic science, preclinical and translational studies."
13205,Filoviruses are emerging pathogens and causative agents of viral haemorrhagic fever.
13206,"Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref."
13207,1).
13208,Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases.
13209,Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential.
13210,"Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells."
13211,"Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator."
13212,Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models.
13213,"Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection."
13214,"In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses."
13215,"This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule."
13216,We provide additional pharmacological characterizations supporting the potential development of BCX4430 as a countermeasure against human filovirus diseases and other viral diseases representing major public health threats.
13217,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature13027) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
13218,It remains challenging to develop animal models of lung infection and severe pneumonia by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome cornavirus (MERS-CoV) without high level of containment.
13219,This inevitably hinders understanding of virushost interaction and development of appropriate countermeasures.
13220,"Here we report that intranasal inoculation of sublethal doses of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A-59 (MHV-A59), a hepatic and neuronal tropic coronavirus, can induce acute pneumonia and severe lung injuries in C57BL/6 mice."
13221,"Inflammatory leukocyte infiltrations, hemorrhages and fibrosis of alveolar walls can be observed 2–11 days after MHV-A59 infection."
13222,"This pathological manifestation is associated with dramatical elevation of tissue IP-10 and IFN-γ and moderate increase of TNF-α and IL-1β, but inability of anti-viral type I interferon response."
13223,These results suggest that intranasal infection of MHV-A59 would serve as a surrogate mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
13224, The therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CH–C) started with interferon (IFN) monotherapy in the early 1990s and this therapy was considered effective in about 10% of cases.
13225,The present standard therapy of pegylated IFN with ribavirin achieves a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients.
13226,"However, about half of the CH–C patients are still at risk of fatal liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma."
13227,The other significant event in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research has been the development of a cell culture system.
13228,The subgenomic replicon system enables robust HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells.
13229,"And recently, the complete life cycle of HCV has been achieved using a genotype 2a strain, JFH1."
13230,"These hallmarks have provided much information about the mechanisms of HCV replication, including information on the host molecules required for the replication."
13231,"Anti-HCV reagents targeting HCV proteins have been developed, and some of them are now in clinical trials."
13232,"However, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase frequently causes mutations in the HCV genome, which lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants."
13233,Some of the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication have already been discovered using the HCV cell culture system.
13234,These host molecules are also candidate targets for antivirals.
13235,"Here, we describe the recent progress regarding the anti-HCV reagents targeting host metabolism."
13236,Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes.
13237,Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions.
13238,"For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment."
13239,"Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections."
13240,"Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes."
13241,"From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes."
13242,"The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals."
13243,"This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level."
13244,"We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture."
13245,"Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures."
13246,"Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general."
13247,This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes.
13248,"Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential."
13249,The swine-origin pandemic (p) H1N1 influenza A virus causes mild upper-respiratory tract disease in most human patients.
13250,"However, some patients developed severe lower-respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences, and the cause of these infections remain unknown."
13251,"Recently, it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to pH1N1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics."
13252,"Here, we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model."
13253,Our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients.
13254,"Severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication, especially in alveolar areas, and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs."
13255,"Moreover, detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down-regulation of IFNα in the lungs."
13256,"Additionally, severe lung lesions were associated with greater up-regulations of pro-apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages."
13257,"In conclusion, this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of pH1N1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts’ capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung."
13258,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13567-014-0085-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
13259,"Several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), produce more severe disease in the elderly, yet the molecular mechanisms governing age-related susceptibility remain poorly studied."
13260,"Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early- and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis."
13261,"Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS."
13262,"In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed."
13263,Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics.
13264,"SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS."
13265,"Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress."
13266,"Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor."
13267,These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality.
13268,"Although the molecular mechanisms governing ARDS pathophysiology remain unknown in aged animals, these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which SARS-CoV infection induces changes in the host response, leading to death."
13269,": Thousands of different microorganisms affect the health, safety, and economic stability of populations."
13270,"Many different medical and governmental organizations have created lists of the pathogenic microorganisms relevant to their missions; however, the nomenclature for biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is inexact."
13271,This ambiguity can be a significant block to effective communication among the diverse communities that must deal with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks.
13272,RESULTS: We have developed a database known as the Microbial Rosetta Stone.
13273,"The database relates microorganism names, taxonomic classifications, diseases, specific detection and treatment protocols, and relevant literature."
13274,The database structure facilitates linkage to public genomic databases.
13275,"This paper focuses on the information in the database for pathogens that impact global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents."
13276,CONCLUSION: The Microbial Rosetta Stone is available at .
13277,"The database provides public access to up-to-date taxonomic classifications of organisms that cause human diseases, improves the consistency of nomenclature in disease reporting, and provides useful links between different public genomic and public health databases."
13278,"Viruses closely related to Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were recently found in stored stool samples from two calves (United Kingdom and Germany) and four pigs (Japan), sparking discussions about the potential for zoonotic transmission."
13279,"To investigate if NLVs are commonly present in farm animals, pooled stool samples from 100 pig farms, 48 chicken farms, 43 dairy cow herds, and 75 veal calf farms from the Netherlands were assayed by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction amplification, using primers specific for the detection of NLVs from humans."
13280,NLV RNA was detected in 33 (44%) of the specimens from veal calf farms and two (2%) specimens from pig farms.
13281,Our data show that NLV infections until recently thought to be restricted to humans occur often in calves and sometimes in pigs.
13282,"While zoonotic transmission has not been proven, these findings suggest that calves and pigs may be reservoir hosts of NLVs."
13283,"We discovered a lethal hemorrhagic syndrome arising from severe thrombocytopenia in Japanese macaques kept at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University."
13284,Extensive investigation identified that simian retrovirus type 4 (SRV-4) was the causative agent of the disease.
13285,SRV-4 had previously been isolated only from cynomolgus macaques in which it is usually asymptomatic.
13286,"We consider that the SRV-4 crossed the so-called species barrier between cynomolgus and Japanese macaques, leading to extremely severe acute symptoms in the latter."
13287,"Infectious agents that cross the species barrier occasionally amplify in virulence, which is not observed in the original hosts."
13288,"In such cases, the new hosts are usually distantly related to the original hosts."
13289,"However, Japanese macaques are closely related to cynomolgus macaques, and can even hybridize when given the opportunity."
13290,This lethal outbreak of a novel pathogen in Japanese macaques highlights the need to modify our expectations about virulence with regards crossing species barriers.
13291,: Provision for the emergence of an influenza pandemic is an urgent issue.
13292,The discovery of a novel anti-influenza therapeutic approach would increase the effectiveness of traditional virus-based strategies.
13293,This study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment on influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced pneumonia in mice.
13294,"METHODS: Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with H1N1, then anti-HMGB1 mAb or control mAb were administered intravenously at 1, 24 and 48 hours after H1N1 inoculation and the survival rate was analyzed."
13295,"Lung lavage and histopathological analysis were performed on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 after inoculation."
13296,"RESULTS: Anti-HMGB1 mAb significantly improved the survival rate of H1N1-inoculated mice (1 out of 15 versus 8 out of 15 deaths in the anti-HMGB1 mAb-treated group versus the control mAb-treated group, p < 0.01), although the treatment did not affect virus propagation in the lungs."
13297,The treatment also significantly attenuated histological changes and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of H1N1-inoculated mice.
13298,"This was associated with inhibition of HMGB1 and suppression of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression and oxidative stress enhancement, which were observed in H1N1-inoculated mice."
13299,The expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products and nuclear factor κB was attenuated by the treatment.
13300,CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HMGB1 mAb may provide a novel and effective pharmacological strategy for severe influenza virus infection in humans by reducing the inflammatory responses induced by HMGB1.
13301,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-015-0983-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
13302,The recent appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) highlights the continual threat to human health posed by emerging viruses.
13303,"However, the central processes in the evolution of emerging viruses are unclear, particularly the selection pressures faced by viruses in new host species."
13304,We outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence.
13305,"We emphasize that, although the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide them with great adaptability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases, their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints."
13306,"Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries."
13307,"Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses."
13308,"We show, however, that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for recombination are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineages and that recombination is unlikely to explain the appearance of SARS in humans."
13309,": Mathematical modeling of virus dynamics has provided quantitative insights into viral infections such as influenza, the simian immunodeficiency virus/human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Through modeling, we can estimate the half-life of infected cells, the exponential growth rate, and the basic reproduction number (R(0))."
13310,"To calculate R(0) from virus load data, the death rate of productively infected cells is required."
13311,"This can be readily estimated from treatment data collected during the chronic phase, but is difficult to determine from acute infection data."
13312,"Here, we propose two new models that can reliably estimate the average life span of infected cells from acute-phase data, and apply both methods to experimental data from humanized mice infected with HIV-1."
13313,"METHODS: Both new models, called as the reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model, are derived by simplification of a standard model for the acute-phase dynamics of target cells, viruses and infected cells."
13314,"By having only a limited number of parameters, both models allow us to reliably estimate the death rate of productively infected cells."
13315,"Simulated datasets with plausible parameter values are generated with the standard model to compare the performance of the new models with that of the major previous model (i.e., the simple exponential model)."
13316,"Finally, we fit models to time course data from HIV-1 infected humanized mice to estimate the several important parameters characterizing their acute infection."
13317,RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The new models provided much better estimates than the previous model because they more precisely capture the de novo infection process.
13318,"Both models describe the acute phase of HIV-1 infected humanized mice reasonably well, and we estimated an average death rate of infected cells of 0.61 and 0.61, an average exponential growth rate of 0.69 and 0.76, and an average basic reproduction number of 2.30 and 2.38 in the RQS model and the PWR model, respectively."
13319,These estimates are fairly close to those obtained in humans.
13320,"The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in ER stress that triggers cytoprotective signaling pathways, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), to restore and maintain homeostasis in the ER or to induce apoptosis if ER stress remains unmitigated."
13321,"The UPR signaling network encompasses three core elements, i.e., PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)."
13322,"Activation of these three branch pathways of the UPR leads to the translation arrest and degradation of misfolded proteins, the expression of ER molecular chaperones, and the expansion of the ER membrane to decrease the load of proteins and increase the protein-folding capacity in the ER."
13323,"Recently, the essential roles of the UPR have been implicated in a number of mammalian diseases, particularly viral diseases."
13324,"In virus-infected cells, the cellular translation machinery is hijacked by the infecting virus to produce large amounts of viral proteins, which inevitably perturbs ER homeostasis and causes ER stress."
13325,"This review summarizes current knowledge about the UPR signaling pathways, highlights two identified UPR pathways in plants, and discuss progress in elucidating the UPR in virus-infected cells and its functional roles in viral infection."
13326, The last century has witnessed the emergence of several previously unknown viruses as life-threatening human pathogens.
13327,"Several examples include HIV, Ebola, Lujo, and, most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola."
13328,"In this study, we describe a method for the swift generation of a human-derived monoclonal antibody, known as LCA60, as a treatment for MERS infections."
13329,LCA60 antibody was generated using the Cellclone Technology from the immortalized B cells of a human donor recovering from MERS.
13330,"Only four months were required from the initial screening of B cells to the development of a stable CHO cell line suitable for the production of clinical grade antibody, thereby delineating a rapid pathway for the development of antiviral therapies against emerging viruses."
13331,"Currently, the LCA60 antibody is being considered for clinical development, which includes prophylaxis in individuals at risk and a treatment for severe MERS-CoV infections."
13332, This paper describes a method to provide improved probability estimates that exposure to a specific dose of an airborne infectious pathogen will result in animal infection.
13333,Individual animals were exposed to a specific dose of airborne pathogen.
13334,"Following exposure, animals were individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection."
13335,The detection of specific antibodies and/or the pathogen in diagnostic specimens was evidence that the exposure dose resulted in infection.
13336,"If replicated over a range of doses, the results can be used to derive a dose–response curve for a variety of animal species and infectious pathogens."
13337,This information is useful in estimating the likelihood of infection associated with exposure to airborne infectious microorganisms.
13338,"Applications include predicting the risk of transmission associated with exposure to airborne pathogens, modeling the transmission of airborne pathogens, and determining requirements for effective exposure doses for vaccines delivered in aerosols."
13339,"Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have limited efficacy in reducing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and increase pneumonia risk, through unknown mechanisms."
13340,Rhinoviruses precipitate most exacerbations and increase susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.
13341,"Here, we show that the ICS fluticasone propionate (FP) impairs innate and acquired antiviral immune responses leading to delayed virus clearance and previously unrecognised adverse effects of enhanced mucus, impaired antimicrobial peptide secretion and increased pulmonary bacterial load during virus-induced exacerbations."
13342,Exogenous interferon-β reverses these effects.
13343,FP suppression of interferon may occur through inhibition of TLR3- and RIG-I virus-sensing pathways.
13344,Mice deficient in the type I interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR1(−/−)) have suppressed antimicrobial peptide and enhanced mucin responses to rhinovirus infection.
13345,This study identifies type I interferon as a central regulator of antibacterial immunity and mucus production.
13346,Suppression of interferon by ICS during virus-induced COPD exacerbations likely mediates pneumonia risk and raises suggestion that inhaled interferon-β therapy may protect.
13347,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged into Canada in January of 2014.
13348,The virus was considered to be of high importance and the number of new cases were tracked using different mechanisms by stakeholders such as veterinary services from the provincial government and the swine industry.
13349,"In addition to the initial date of infection, veterinary organizations in the swine industry maintained a disease control program (DCP) database that contained the date of declaration of freedom from PEDV in individual herds."
13350,"Such data allowed for the determination of the duration of PEDV infection in individual herds based on herd type, year and season of diagnosis."
13351,"Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine time to PEDV elimination in Ontario swine herds infected between 2014 and 2017, on the basis of records from the DCP database; and to identify factors associated with the likelihood of elimination."
13352,Duration of time to eliminate PEDV was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
13353,"The final Cox's proportional hazard model included herd type, season and year of diagnosis."
13354,"The hazard of PEDV elimination for premises that were farrow-to-wean was 3.36 times larger (P-value: 0.044, 95% CI: 1.03, 10.93) than for farrow-to-feeder herds."
13355,"Herds diagnosed in the summer and fall had hazard ratios of 1.40 (P-value: 0.044, 95% CI: 1.03, 10.93) and 7.32 (P-value: <0.001, 95% CI: 3.12, 17.18), respectively compared to herds diagnosed in the winter months."
13356,"The hazard ratio for herds diagnosed in 2015 was 0.54 (P-value: 0.015, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.89) compared to herds diagnosed in 2014."
13357,"Factors associated with time to elimination are likely reflective of the complexity of infection control practices applied in herds with different demographics and population structures, seasonal variability in the pathogen transmissibility, and the availability of resources to manage an emerging production-limiting disease."
13358,"The median times to elimination were relatively long, which could be due to how it was measured, decisions made at the level of individual herds or delays related to reporting PEDV elimination."
13359,Design of control measures for production-limiting diseases at the regional level should take these factors into consideration.
13360,"The purpose of this article is to provide for practitioners a comprehensive overview of respiratory diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, in the mouse, rat, hamster, and gerbil."
13361,The information presented will also be useful for veterinarians pursuing board certification.
13362,"Anatomy and physiology are briefly addressed, as those two facets alone could encompass an entire article for these species."
13363,The recurrence of new human cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) underscores the need for effective therapeutic countermeasures.
13364,Nonhuman primate models are considered the gold standard for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic countermeasures.
13365,"However, MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease in humans is associated with high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract, which may be difficult to achieve in nonhuman primate models."
13366,"Considering this limitation, we wanted to ascertain the effectiveness of using a MERS-CoV infectious clone (icMERS-0) previously shown to replicate to higher titers than the wild-type EMC 2012 strain."
13367,We observed respiratory disease resulting from exposure to the icMERS-0 strain as measured by CT in rhesus monkeys with concomitant detection of virus antigen by immunohistochemistry.
13368,"Overall, respiratory disease was mild and transient, resolving by day 30 post-infection."
13369,"Although pulmonary disease was mild, these results demonstrate for the first time the utility of CT imaging to measure disease elicited by a MERS-CoV infectious clone system in nonhuman primate models."
13370," A novel coronavirus, termed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infected humans in Guangdong, China, in November 2002 and the subsequent efficient human-to-human transmissions of this virus caused profound disturbances in over 30 countries worldwide in 2003."
13371,"Eventually, this epidemic was controlled by isolation and there has been no human infection reported since January 2004."
13372,"However, research on different aspects of the SARS-CoV is not waning, as it is not known if this virus will re-emerge, especially since its origins and potential reservoir(s) are unresolved."
13373,The SARS-CoV genome is nearly 30kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs).
13374,"Some of these ORFs encode for genes that are homologous to proteins found in all known coronaviruses, namely the replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b) and the four structural proteins: nucleocapsid, spike, membrane and envelope, and these proteins are expected to be essential for the replication of the virus."
13375,"The remaining eight ORFs encodes for accessory proteins, varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids, which are unique to SARS-CoV."
13376,"This review will summarize the expeditious research on these accessory viral proteins in three major areas: (i) the detection of antibodies against accessory proteins in the serum of infected patients, (ii) the expression, processing and cellular localization of the accessory proteins, and (iii) the effects of the accessory proteins on cellular functions."
13377,"These in-depth molecular and biochemical characterizations of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, which have no homologues in other coronaviruses, may offer clues as to why the SARS-CoV causes such a severe and rapid attack in humans, while other coronaviruses that infect humans seem to be more forgiving."
13378,Half of the human population is at risk of infection by an arthropod-borne virus.
13379,"Many of these arboviruses, such as West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses, infect humans by way of a bite from an infected mosquito."
13380,This infectious inoculum is insect cell-derived giving the virus particles distinct qualities not present in secondary infectious virus particles produced by infected vertebrate host cells.
13381,"The insect cell-derived particles differ in the glycosylation of virus structural proteins and the lipid content of the envelope, as well as their induction of cytokines."
13382,"Thus, in order to accurately mimic the inoculum delivered by arthropods, arboviruses should be derived from arthropod cells."
13383,"Previous studies have packaged replicon genome in mammalian cells to produce replicon particles, which undergo only one round of infection, but no studies exist packaging replicon particles in mosquito cells."
13384,"Here we optimized the packaging of West Nile virus replicon genome in mosquito cells and produced replicon particles at high concentration, allowing us to mimic mosquito cell-derived viral inoculum."
13385,These particles were mature with similar genome equivalents-to-infectious units as full-length West Nile virus.
13386,We then compared the mosquito cell-derived particles to mammalian cell-derived particles in mice.
13387,Both replicon particles infected skin at the inoculation site and the draining lymph node by 3 hours post-inoculation.
13388,The mammalian cell-derived replicon particles spread from the site of inoculation to the spleen and contralateral lymph nodes significantly more than the particles derived from mosquito cells.
13389,This in vivo difference in spread of West Nile replicons in the inoculum demonstrates the importance of using arthropod cell-derived particles to model early events in arboviral infection and highlights the value of these novel arthropod cell-derived replicon particles for studying the earliest virus-host interactions for arboviruses.
13390,"Although the risk of infection with hepatitis and human immunodeficiency viruses from blood transfusions has been reduced to negligible levels, emerging infections continue to offer threats."
13391,"Such threats occur with any infection that has an asymptomatic, blood-borne phase."
13392,"In the past, it was thought that any emerging transfusion-transmitted disease would have epidemiologic properties similar to those of AIDS or viral hepatitis."
13393,"Over the past 20 years, however, greatest concern has arisen from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, West Nile virus, and Babesia."
13394,These and other emerging infections are discussed in the context of blood safety.
13395,": The emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV) causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans, with high fatality rates."
13396,"Nipah virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, posing a high risk for epidemic outbreaks."
13397,"However, a broadly applicable approach for human NiV outbreaks in field settings is lacking."
13398,"METHODS: We engineered new antiviral lipopeptides and analyzed in vitro fusion inhibition to identify an optimal candidate for prophylaxis of NiV infection in the lower respiratory tract, and we assessed antiviral efficiency in 2 different animal models."
13399,RESULTS: We show that lethal NiV infection can be prevented with lipopeptides delivered via the respiratory route in both hamsters and nonhuman primates.
13400,"By targeting retention of peptides for NiV prophylaxis in the respiratory tract, we avoid its systemic delivery in individuals who need only prevention, and thus we increase the safety of treatment and enhance utility of the intervention."
13401,CONCLUSIONS: The experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of antifusion lipopeptides for prophylaxis of lethal NiV.
13402,These results advance the goal of rational development of potent lipopeptide inhibitors with desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties and a safe effective delivery method to target NiV and other pathogenic viruses.
13403,"During the recent severe acute respiratory (SARS) outbreak, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV)."
13404,We have isolated a SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) strain by injecting Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia; the patient traveled from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003.
13405,Ultrastructural analysis of infected Vero cells showed the virions within cell vesicles and around the cell membrane.
13406,The full-length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the Hong-Kong Hotel M isolate.
13407,"By using both real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay and an infectivity plaque assay, we determined that approximately 360 viral genomes were required to generate a PFU."
13408,"In addition, heparin (100 μg/mL) inhibited infection of Vero cells by 50%."
13409,"Overall, the molecular and biologic characteristics of the strain HSR1 provide evidence that SARS-CoV forms a fourth genetic coronavirus group with distinct genomic and biologic features."
13410, Autoimmune reactivity and autoimmune disease in the eye is a rapidly expanding area of research and therapy.
13411,We present evidence implicating three distinct classes of infectious agents in the development of an autoimmune process within the retina.
13412,"We highlight two human diseases triggered by Onchocerca volvulus or Toxoplasma gondii and an experimental model of retinal degenerative disease, referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR)."
13413,Analysis of these systems revealed distinct pathogenic mechanisms involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by each organism.
13414,"In T. gondii infections, the chronic reactivation is probably responsible for the presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes of the immune system."
13415,"In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and the human RPE protein may contribute to retinal pathology."
13416,"In ECOR, differences in time of induction, duration, and intensity of innate immune reactivity may contribute to autoimmune reactivity in BALB/c mice."
13417,"With >1600 documented human infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and a case fatality rate of approximately 36%, medical countermeasures are needed to prevent and limit the disease."
13418,"We examined the in vivo efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody m336, which has high neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV in vitro."
13419,m336 was administered to rabbits intravenously or intranasally before infection with MERS-CoV.
13420,"Prophylaxis with m336 resulted in a reduction of pulmonary viral RNA titers by 40–9000-fold, compared with an irrelevant control antibody with little to no inflammation or viral antigen detected."
13421,This protection in rabbits supports further clinical development of m336.

13423," In addition to neuraminidase inhibitors and other drugs that directly target viral replication, a number of adjunctive and immunomodulatory therapies are currently under evaluation for the treatment of influenza."
13424,"These novel treatments, which focus either on pathophysiological aspects of influenza virus infection or the neutralization of virus with antibodies, are the subject of this review."
13425,"Cytokine dysregulation has been observed in patients with severe influenza, such as avian influenza A (H5N1) and pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1pdm09) virus infections, but the role of immunomodulatory therapy is unclear, due to lack of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)."
13426,Convalescent plasma appears to be useful as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of H5N1 and H1N1pdm09 infections.
13427,"Until lately, data interpretation was limited to case reports and studies of non-randomized design, but a recent RCT found that patients with severe influenza A (H1N1pdm09) who were treated with hyperimmune immunoglobulin from persons who had survived the same disease had a lower peak viral load and lower mortality than controls, providing treatment was begun within 5days of symptom onset."
13428,"The efficacy of agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including intravenous immunoglobulin, N-acetylcysteine, acute use of statins, macrolides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, celecoxib and mesalazine, and the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy, deserve more investigation and where feasible, studies by RCTs."
13429,"Prospective observational studies have shown that systemic corticosteroids increase morbidity (e.g., secondary infections) and mortality in H1N1pdm09 influenza."
13430,This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on “Treatment of influenza: targeting the virus or the host.”
13431,In vivo experiments in animal models of disease are of crucial importance for viral tropism and pathogenesis studies.
13432,"However, these experiments must be complemented with in vitro and ex vivo experiments."
13433,"Here, we describe a protocol for the preparation and ex vivo infection of lung slices from different mammalian host species with various respiratory paramyxoviruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins, and suggest follow-up experiments including immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy."
13434,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the major cause of severe hand-foot-and-mouth diseases (HFMD), especially encephalitis and other nervous system diseases."
13435,EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 mediates virus attachment and is the important virulence factor in the EV-A71pathogenesis.
13436,"In this study, we explored the roles of VP1 in the permeability of blood–brain barrier (BBB)."
13437,"Sera albumin, Evans blue, and dextran leaked into brain parenchyma of the 1-week-old C57BL/6J mice intracranially injected with VP1 recombinant protein."
13438,"VP1 also increased the permeability of the brain endothelial cells monolayer, an in vitro BBB model."
13439,Tight junction protein claudin-5 was reduced in the brain tissues or brain endothelial cells treated with VP1.
13440,"In contrast, VP1 increased the expression of virus receptor vimentin, which could be blocked with VP1 neutralization antibody."
13441,Vimentin expression in the VP1-treated brain endothelial cells was regulated by TGF-β/Smad-3 and NF-κB signal pathways.
13442,"Moreover, vimentin over-expression was accompanied with compromised BBB."
13443,"From these studies, we conclude that EV-A71 virus capsid protein VP1 disrupted BBB and increased virus receptor vimentin, which both may contribute to the virus entrance into brain and EV-A71 CNS infection."
13444,Risk Group 4 pathogens are a group of often lethal human viruses for which there are no widely available vaccines or therapeutics.
13445,"These viruses are endemic to specific geographic locations and typically cause relatively infrequent, self-limiting, but often devastating human disease outbreaks (e.g."
13446,"Ebola virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Lassa virus)."
13447,The overall rarity of disease outbreaks with the associated lack of clinical data and the requirement for research on Risk Group 4 pathogens to be performed in maximum (biosafety level 4) containment necessarily impede progress in medical countermeasure development.
13448,"Next-generation technologies may aid to bridge the current gaps of knowledge by increasing the amount of useful data that can be gleaned from individual diagnostic samples, possibly even at point-of-care; enable personalized medicine approaches through genomic virus characterization in the clinic; refine our comprehension of pathogenesis by using ex vivo technologies such as organs-on-chips or organoids; identify novel correlates of protection or disease survival that could inform novel medical countermeasure development; or support patient and treatment response monitoring through non-invasive techniques such as medical imaging."
13449,This chapter provides an overview of a subset of such technologies and how they may positively impact the field of Risk Group 4 pathogen research in the near future.
13450,"Chapter 18 Emerging Diseases at the Interface of People, Domestic Animals, and Wildlife*"
13451, Swine influenza virus (SIV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp) are widespread in farms and are major pathogens involved in the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC).
13452,The aim of this experiment was to compare the pathogenicity of European avian-like swine H1N1 and European human-like reassortant swine H1N2 viruses in naïve pigs and in pigs previously infected with Mhp.
13453,"Six groups of SPF pigs were inoculated intra-tracheally with either Mhp, or H1N1, or H1N2 or Mhp+H1N1 or Mhp+H1N2, both pathogens being inoculated at 21 days intervals in these two last groups."
13454,A mock-infected group was included.
13455,"Although both SIV strains induced clinical signs when singly inoculated, results indicated that the H1N2 SIV was more pathogenic than the H1N1 virus, with an earlier shedding and a greater spread in lungs."
13456,"Initial infection with Mhp before SIV inoculation increased flu clinical signs and pathogenesis (hyperthermia, loss of appetite, pneumonia lesions) due to the H1N1 virus but did not modify significantly outcomes of H1N2 infection."
13457,"Thus, Mhp and SIV H1N1 appeared to act synergistically, whereas Mhp and SIV H1N2 would compete, as H1N2 infection led to the elimination of Mhp in lung diaphragmatic lobes."
13458,"In conclusion, SIV would be a risk factor for the severity of respiratory disorders when associated with Mhp, depending on the viral subtype involved."
13459,This experimental model of coinfection with Mhp and avian-like swine H1N1 is a relevant tool for studying the pathogenesis of SIV-associated PRDC and testing intervention strategies for the control of the disease.
13460,"The ongoing moratorium on gain-of-function (GOF) research with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn attention to the current debate on these research practices and the potential benefits and risks they present."
13461,"While much of the discussion has been steered by members of the microbiology and policy communities, additional input from medical practitioners will be highly valuable toward developing a broadly inclusive policy that considers the relative value and harm of GOF research."
13462,"This review attempts to serve as a primer on the topic for the clinical community by providing a historical context for GOF research, summarizing concerns about its risks, and surveying the medical products that it has yielded."
13463,No effective drug is currently available for treatment of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection.
13464,Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq.
13465,(ST) has been used as a herbal constituent of traditional Chinese medicine.
13466,We studied whether the aqueous extract of Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq (STE) has antiviral activity.
13467,"STE inhibited replication of EV71, as evident by its ability to diminish plaque formation and cytopathic effect induced by EV71, and to inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and protein."
13468,"Moreover, daily single-dose STE treatment significantly improved the survival of EV71-infected mice, and ameliorated the symptoms."
13469,"Mechanistically, STE exerts multiple effects on enteroviral infection."
13470,"Treatment with STE reduced viral attachment and entry; the cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G) by EV71 protease, 2A(pro); virus-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation; and relocation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm."
13471,It was accompanied by a decline in EV71-associated hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15.
13472,"It is plausible that STE may inhibit ROS-induced p38 kinase activation, and subsequent hnRNP A1 relocation and EPS15-mediated membrane trafficking in infected cells."
13473,"These findings suggest that STE possesses anti-EV71 activities, and may serve as health food or candidate antiviral drug for protection against EV71."
13474,OBJECTIVE: To clarify the possible association between the Zika virus (ZIKV) and microcephaly and understand where we are in terms of research and the debate on the causation between mild maternal clinical features and severe fetal microcephaly.
13475,"DATA SOURCES: We did a comprehensive literature review with the keywords “zika” and/or “microcephaly” from inception to May 27, 2016, with PubMed."
13476,STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included and analyzed if they met all of the following criteria: “probable or confirmed infant microcephaly” and “probable or confirmed ZIKV infection among mothers or infants”.
13477,"RESULTS: We emphasize the diagnosis of ZIKV infection, including maternal clinical manifestations, maternal and fetal laboratory confirmation, and possible autopsy if need."
13478,Other confounders that may lead to microcephaly should be excluded from the study.
13479,"We presented the results from clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection, testing methods evolving but the mechanism of microcephaly uncertain, flexible definition challenging the diagnosis of microcephaly, and limited causal reference on pregnant women."
13480,We made analog comparison of severe acute respiratory syndrome and chikungunya virus in terms of DNA mutation and global movement to provide further research recommendation.
13481,The chance of catch-up growth may decrease the number of pervious “diagnosed” microcephaly.
13482,CONCLUSIONS: There are some evidence available through mice models and direct isolation of ZIKV in affected pregnancies on kindly causal relationship but not convincible enough.
13483,We analyzed and presented the weakness or limitation of published reports with the desire to shed light to further study directions.
13484," A new disease, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerged at the end of 2002 and caused profound disturbances in over 30 countries worldwide in 2003."
13485,A novel coronavirus was identified as the aetiological agent of SARS and the 30kb viral genome was deciphered with unprecedented speed in a coordinated manner by the global community.
13486,"Since then, much progress has been made in the virological and molecular characterization of the proteins encoded by SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome, which contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs)."
13487,"These investigations can be broadly classified into three groups: (a) studies on the replicase 1a/1b gene products which are important for viral replication, (b) studies on the structural proteins, spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope, which have homologues in all coronaviruses, and are important for viral assembly and (c) expression and functional studies of the “accessory” proteins that are specifically encoded by SARS-CoV."
13488,A comparison of the properties of these three groups of SARS-CoV proteins with the knowledge that coronavirologists have generated over more than 30 years of research can help us in the prevention and treatment of SARS in the event of the re-emergence of this new infectious disease.
13489,": Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae, is spread via nasal secretions and causes respiratory disease, neurological disorders and abortions."
13490,"The virus is a significant equine pathogen, but current EHV-1 vaccines are only partially protective and effective metaphylactic and therapeutic agents are not available."
13491,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNA's), delivered intranasally, could prove a valuable alternative for infection control."
13492,"siRNA's against two essential EHV-1 genes, encoding the viral helicase (Ori) and glycoprotein B, were evaluated for their potential to decrease EHV-1 infection in a mouse model."
13493,METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FNDINGS: siRNA therapy in vitro significantly reduced virus production and plaque size.
13494,Viral titers were reduced 80-fold with 37.5 pmol of a single siRNA or with as little as 6.25 pmol of each siRNA when used in combination.
13495,siRNA therapy in vivo significantly reduced viral replication and clinical signs.
13496,Intranasal treatment did not require a transport vehicle and proved effective when given up to 12 h before or after infection.
13497,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: siRNA treatment has potential for both prevention and early treatment of EHV-1 infections.
13498,"A close relative of poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71) is regarded as an important neurotropic virus of serious public health concern."
13499,"EV71 causes Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and has been associated with neurological complications in young children."
13500,Our limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its neuropathogenesis has hampered the development of effective therapeutic options.
13501,"Here, using a two-dimensional proteomics approach combined with mass spectrometry, we have identified a unique panel of host proteins that were differentially and dynamically modulated during EV71 infection of motor-neuron NSC-34 cells, which are found at the neuromuscular junctions where EV71 is believed to enter the central nervous system."
13502,Meta-analysis with previously published proteomics studies in neuroblastoma or muscle cell lines revealed minimal overlapping which suggests unique host-pathogen interactions in NSC-34 cells.
13503,"Among the candidate proteins, we focused our attention on prohibitin (PHB), a protein that is involved in multiple cellular functions and the target of anti-cancer drug Rocaglamide (Roc-A)."
13504,"We demonstrated that cell surface-expressed PHB is involved in EV71 entry into neuronal cells specifically, while membrane-bound mitochondrial PHB associates with the virus replication complex and facilitates viral replication."
13505,"Furthermore, Roc-A treatment of EV71-infected neuronal cells reduced significantly virus yields."
13506,"However, the inhibitory effect of Roc-A on PHB in NSC-34 cells was not through blocking the CRAF/MEK/ERK pathway as previously reported."
13507,"Instead, Roc-A treated NSC-34 cells had lower mitochondria-associated PHB and lower ATP levels that correlated with impaired mitochondria integrity."
13508,"In vivo, EV71-infected mice treated with Roc-A survived longer than the vehicle-treated animals and had significantly lower virus loads in their spinal cord and brain, whereas virus titers in their limb muscles were comparable to controls."
13509,"Together, this study uncovers PHB as the first host factor that is specifically involved in EV71 neuropathogenesis and a potential drug target to limit neurological complications."
13510,": We previously reported that Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection activates autophagy, which promotes viral replication both in vitro and in vivo."
13511,In the present study we further investigated whether EV71 infection of neuronal SK-N-SH cells induces an autophagic flux.
13512,"Furthermore, the effects of autophagy on EV71-related pathogenesis and viral load were evaluated after intracranial inoculation of mouse-adapted EV71 (MP4 strain) into 6-day-old ICR suckling mice."
13513,"RESULTS: We demonstrated that in EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells, EV71 structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C co-localized with LC3 and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR, endosome marker) proteins by immunofluorescence staining, indicating amphisome formation."
13514,"Together with amphisome formation, EV71 induced an autophagic flux, which could be blocked by NH(4)Cl (inhibitor of acidification) and vinblastine (inhibitor of fusion), as demonstrated by Western blotting."
13515,"Suckling mice intracranially inoculated with EV71 showed EV71 VP1 protein expression (representing EV71 infection) in the cerebellum, medulla, and pons by immunohistochemical staining."
13516,"Accompanied with these infected brain tissues, increased expression of LC3-II protein as well as formation of LC3 aggregates, autophagosomes and amphisomes were detected."
13517,"Amphisome formation, which was confirmed by colocalization of EV71-VP1 protein or LC3 puncta and the endosome marker protein MPR."
13518,"Thus, EV71-infected suckling mice (similar to EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells) also show an autophagic flux."
13519,"The physiopathological parameters of EV71-MP4 infected mice, including body weight loss, disease symptoms, and mortality were increased compared to those of the uninfected mice."
13520,"We further blocked EV71-induced autophagy with the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which attenuated the disease symptoms and decreased the viral load in the brain tissues of the infected mice."
13521,"CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we reveal that EV71 infection of suckling mice induces an amphisome formation accompanied with the autophagic flux in the brain tissues."
13522,Autophagy induced by EV71 promotes viral replication and EV71-related pathogenesis.
13523,"Outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock are not uncommon, and an important component in containment of such emerging viral diseases is rapid and reliable diagnostics."
13524,Such methods are often PCR-based and hence require the availability of sequence data from the pathogen.
13525,Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens.
13526,"Transmission may be direct via contact with the animal, for example, through exposure to its faecal matter, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors."
13527,Here we investigated the viral content in rat faecal matter (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA.
13528,"Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the Picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples."
13529,Here we describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including near-full-length genomes closely related to the Boone cardiovirus and Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus.
13530,"From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized."
13531,The virome of R. norvegicus should be investigated further to assess the full potential for zoonotic virus transmission.
13532,": Globally, regions at the highest risk for emerging infectious diseases are often the ones with the fewest resources."
13533,"As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging."
13534,"The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed."
13535,"Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance."
13536,"This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings."
13537,We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations.
13538,"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host’s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model."
13539,"Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR."
13540,"Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia."
13541,Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus.
13542,"CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts."
13543,Background.
13544,Infections caused by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus range from mild upper respiratory tract syndromes to fatal diseases.
13545,"However, studies comparing virological and immunological profile of different clinical severity are lacking."
13546,Methods.
13547,"We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 74 patients with pandemic H1N1 infection, including 23 patients who either developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died (ARDS-death group), 14 patients with desaturation requiring oxygen supplementation and who survived without ARDS (survived-without-ARDS group), and 37 patients with mild disease without desaturation (mild-disease group)."
13548,"We compared their pattern of clinical disease, viral load, and immunological profile."
13549,Results.
13550,"Patients with severe disease were older, more likely to be obese or having underlying diseases, and had lower respiratory tract symptoms, especially dyspnea at presentation."
13551,"The ARDS-death group had a slower decline in nasopharyngeal viral loads, had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and were more likely to have bacterial coinfections (30.4%), myocarditis (21.7%), or viremia (13.0%) than patients in the survived-without-ARDS or the mild-disease groups."
13552,"Reactive hemophagocytosis, thrombotic phenomena, lymphoid atrophy, diffuse alveolar damage, and multiorgan dysfunction similar to fatal avian influenza A H5N1 infection were found at postmortem examinations."
13553,Conclusions.
13554,The slower control of viral load and immunodysregulation in severe cases mandate the search for more effective antiviral and immunomodulatory regimens to stop the excessive cytokine activation resulting in ARDS and death.
13555,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has caused over 2400 cases and more than 800 deaths.
13556,Epidemiological studies identified diabetes as the primary comorbidity associated with severe or lethal MERS-CoV infection.
13557,Understanding how diabetes affects MERS is important because of the global burden of diabetes and pandemic potential of MERS-CoV.
13558,"We used a model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by expressing human DPP4, and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high-fat diet."
13559,"Upon infection with MERS-CoV, diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery that was independent of virus titers."
13560,"Histological analysis revealed that diabetic mice had delayed inflammation, which was then prolonged through 21 days after infection."
13561,"Diabetic mice had fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and CD4(+) T cells, which correlated with lower levels of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 expression."
13562,"Diabetic mice also had lower levels of Tnfa, Il6, Il12b, and Arg1 expression and higher levels of Il17a expression."
13563,"These data suggest that the increased disease severity observed in individuals with MERS and comorbid type 2 diabetes is likely due to a dysregulated immune response, which results in more severe and prolonged lung pathology."
13564," Although mucosal immune responses are critical for protection of hosts from clinical illness and even mortality caused by mucosal pathogens, the molecular mechanism of mucosal immunity, which is independent of systemic immunity, remains elusive."
13565,"To explore the mechanistic basis of mucosal protective immunity, gene transcriptional profiling in mucosal tissues was evaluated after the primary and secondary immunization of animals with an attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype of Coronavirus and a well-characterized mucosal pathogen."
13566,"Results showed that a number of innate immune factors including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), type I interferons (IFNs), complements, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) were activated locally after the primary immunization."
13567,"This was accompanied or immediately followed by a potent Th1 adaptive immunity as evidenced by the activation of T-cell signaling molecules, surface markers, and effector molecules."
13568,"A strong humoral immune response as supported by the significantly up-regulated immunoglobulin (Ig) gamma chain was observed in the absence of innate, Th1 adaptive immunity, or IgA up-regulation after the secondary immunization, indicating that the local memory response is dominated by IgG."
13569,"Overall, the results provided the first detailed kinetics on the molecular basis underlying the development of primary and secondary mucosal immunity."
13570,The key molecular signatures identified may provide new opportunities for improved prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat mucosal infections.
13571,": Infectious diseases have contributed to the decline and local extinction of several wildlife species, including African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus)."
13572,"Mitigating such disease threats is challenging, partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches."
13573,"Serious impacts on susceptible populations most frequently occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant (often domestic) “reservoir” hosts, and spill over into less abundant host species."
13574,"If this is the case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate."
13575,"However, pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important, and may not be controllable by managing another host species."
13576,"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated interspecific and intraspecific transmission routes, by comparing African wild dogs' exposure to six canine pathogens with behavioural measures of their opportunities for contact with domestic dogs and with other wild dogs."
13577,"Domestic dog contact was associated with exposure to canine parvovirus, Ehrlichia canis, Neospora caninum and perhaps rabies virus, but not with exposure to canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus."
13578,Contact with other wild dogs appeared not to increase the risk of exposure to any of the pathogens.
13579,"CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings, combined with other data, suggest that management directed at domestic dogs might help to protect wild dog populations from rabies virus, but not from canine distemper virus."
13580,"However, further analyses are needed to determine the management approaches – including no intervention – which are most appropriate for each pathogen."
13581,About 30% of weanling rats inoculated with JHM virus developed a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) 3 weeks after inoculation (a.i.).
13582,"From the remaining animals, 5% displayed overt neurological signs 3,6, and 8 months a.i."
13583,Animals with and without clinical signs 6–8 months a.i.
13584,were morphologically examined.
13585,Fresh demyelinating lesions could be demonstrated in paralyzed animals.
13586,Viral antigen was demonstrated and infectious JHM virus could be recovered from one animal which developed clinical signs at 3 months a.i.
13587,"In one animal with clinical onset of 8 months a.i., completely remyelinated areas as well as recent demyelinating lesions were observed, suggesting a recurrence of the disease process."
13588,Remyelinated areas were also found in 40% of clinically silent animals.
13589,The morphology of the late onset of the demyelination was similar to that occurring in SDE.
13590,Remyelination consisted of both CNS and PNS-type.
13591,This animal model offers the possibility to investigate the virus-host relationship which is responsible for the induction of a demyelinating process after a long incubation period.
13592,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in September 2012 and to date 86 deaths from a total of 206 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to the WHO.
13593,"Camels have been implicated as the reservoir of MERS-CoV, but the exact source and mode of transmission for most patients remain unknown."
13594,"During a 3 month period, June to August 2013, there were 12 positive MERS-CoV cases reported from the Hafr Al-Batin region district in the north east region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
13595,"In addition to the different regional camel festivals in neighboring countries, Hafr Al-Batin has the biggest camel market in the entire Kingdom and hosts an annual camel festival."
13596,"Thus, we conducted a detailed epidemiological, clinical and genomic study to ascertain common exposure and transmission patterns of all cases of MERS-CoV reported from Hafr Al-Batin."
13597,Analysis of previously reported genetic data indicated that at least two of the infected contacts could not have been directly infected from the index patient and alternate source should be considered.
13598,"While camels appear as the likely source, other sources have not been ruled out."
13599,"More detailed case control studies with detailed case histories, epidemiological information and genomic analysis are being conducted to delineate the missing pieces in the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV outbreak."
13600,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of severe lower respiratory illness in infants and young children, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for viral pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated."
13601,"To date, no drugs or vaccines have been employed to improve clinical outcomes for RSV-infected patients."
13602,"In this paper, we report that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protected against severe lung injury induced by RSV infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients."
13603,"Moreover, ACE2 deficiency aggravated RSV-associated disease pathogenesis, mainly by its action on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)."
13604,"Furthermore, administration of a recombinant ACE2 protein alleviated the severity of RSV-induced lung injury."
13605,"These findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in preventing RSV-induced lung injury, and suggest that ACE2 is a promising potential therapeutic target in the management of RSV-induced lung disease."
13606,": The pathogenesis and immune response to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a recently discovered coronavirus, MERS-CoV, have not been fully characterized because a suitable animal model is currently not available."
13607,(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a longitudinal noninvasive approach can be beneficial in providing biomarkers for host immune response.
13608,[(18)F]-FDG uptake is increased in activated immune cells in response to virus entry and can be localized by PET imaging.
13609,We used [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT to investigate the host response developing in nonhuman primates after MERS-CoV exposure and applied kinetic modeling to monitor the influx rate constant (K(i)) in responsive lymphoid tissue.
13610,METHODS: Multiple [(18)F]-FDG-PET and CT images were acquired on a PET/CT clinical scanner modified to operate in a biosafety level 4 environment prior to and up to 29 days after MERS-CoV aerosol exposure.
13611,"Time activity curves of various lymphoid tissues were reconstructed to follow the [(18)F]-FDG uptake for approximately 60 min (3,600 s)."
13612,Image-derived input function was used to calculate K(i) for lymphoid tissues by Patlak plot.
13613,RESULTS: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed alterations in K(i) that was associated with the time point (p < 0.001) after virus exposure and the location of lymphoid tissue (p = 0.0004).
13614,"As revealed by a statistically significant interaction (p < 0.0001) between these two factors, the pattern of K(i) changes over time differed between three locations but not between subjects."
13615,A distinguished pattern of statistically significant elevation in K(i) was observed in mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) that correlated to K(i) changes in axillary LNs.
13616,Changes in LNs K(i) were concurrent with elevations of monocytes in peripheral blood.
13617,CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]-FDG-PET is able to detect subtle changes in host immune response to contain a subclinical virus infection.
13618,Full quantitative analysis is the preferred approach rather than semiquantitative analysis using standardized uptake value for detection of the immune response to the virus.

13620," Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel single-stranded, positive-sense RNA betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
13621,"Dromedary camels, hosts for MERS-CoV, are implicated in direct or indirect transmission to human beings, although the exact mode of transmission is unknown."
13622,"The virus was first isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."
13623,"As of May 31, 2015, 1180 laboratory-confirmed cases (483 deaths; 40% mortality) have been reported to WHO."
13624,Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmission reported in the community.
13625,"Although most cases of MERS have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cases have been reported in Europe, the USA, and Asia in people who travelled from the Middle East or their contacts."
13626,"Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities."
13627,No specific drug treatment exists for MERS and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent spread in health-care facilities.
13628,"MERS-CoV continues to be an endemic, low-level public health threat."
13629,"However, the virus could mutate to have increased interhuman transmissibility, increasing its pandemic potential."
13630,Bats have been increasingly recognized as reservoir of important zoonotic viruses.
13631,"However, until now many attempts to isolate bat-borne viruses in cell culture have been unsuccessful."
13632,"Further, experimental studies on reservoir host species have been limited by the difficulty of rearing these species."
13633,"The epithelium of the respiratory tract plays a central role during airborne transmission, as it is the first tissue encountered by viral particles."
13634,"Although several cell lines from bats were established recently, no well-characterized, selectively cultured airway epithelial cells were available so far."
13635,"Here, primary cells and immortalized cell lines from bats of the two important suborders Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera, Carollia perspicillata (Seba's short-tailed bat) and Eidolon helvum (Straw-colored fruit bat), were successfully cultured under standardized conditions from both fresh and frozen organ specimens by cell outgrowth of organ explants and by the use of serum-free primary cell culture medium."
13636,Cells were immortalized to generate permanent cell lines.
13637,Cells were characterized for their epithelial properties such as expression of cytokeratin and tight junctions proteins and permissiveness for viral infection with Rift-Valley fever virus and vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana.
13638,These cells can serve as suitable models for the study of bat-borne viruses and complement cell culture models for virus infection in human airway epithelial cells.
13639," Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly contagious disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), in sheep and goats which has been considered as a serious threat to the local economy in Africa and Asia."
13640,"However, the in-depth evolutionary dynamics of PPRV during an epidemic is not well understood."
13641,We conducted phylogenetic analysis on genomic sequences of 25 PPRV strains from China 2013–2014 outbreaks.
13642,All these strains clustered into a novel clade in lineage 4.
13643,"An evolutionary rate of 2.61 × 10−6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day was estimated, dating the most recent common ancestor of PPRV China 2013–2014 strains to early August 2013."
13644,"Transmission network analysis revealed that all the virus sequences could be grouped into five clusters of infection, suggesting long-distance animal transmission play an important role in the spread of PPRV in China."
13645,These results expanded our knowledge for PPRV evolution to achieve effective control measures.
13646,Estimating detailed transmission trees that reflect the relationships between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological process.
13647,"These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals."
13648,Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate.
13649,"Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees."
13650,"We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled."
13651,"Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41 472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data."
13652,These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data.
13653,"In marked contrast to their historical classification as relatively harmless, common cold-causing, respiratory pathogens, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with more severe clinical complications, as emphasized by the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003."
13654,"Still, their precise pathogenic potential is largely unknown, particularly regarding the most recently identified strains HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, and definite proof for their etiology remains a major challenge."
13655,"This article focuses on the characteristics of the five HCoVs that are known, and summarizes current knowledge of their pathogenic potential in people, with an emphasis on the interactions between these viruses and their cognate receptors on susceptible target cells."
13656, Viral hepatitis remains the most common cause of liver disease and a major public health problem.
13657,"Here, we focus on the role of CD4 CD8 double negative T (DN T) cells involved in the mechanisms of viral persistence in hepatitis."
13658,C3H/HeJ mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) were used to display chronic viral hepatitis.
13659,DN T cells dramatically increased in MHV-3 infected mice.
13660,Adoptive transfer of DN T cells from MHV-3 infected mice led to a significant increase in mice survival.
13661,The DN T cells with production of IFN-γ and IL-2 are able to kill virus-specific CD8+ T cells via the Fas/FasL dependent pathway.
13662,The delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells may lead to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis.
13663,"In short, our study identified DN T cells contributing to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis in C3H/HeJ mice, which provides a rationale for modulating DN T cells for the management of viral hepatitis."
13664,High seroprevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels has been previously reported in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
13665,"However, the molecular detection of the virus has never been reported before in UAE."
13666,"Of the 7,803 nasal swabs tested in the epidemiological survey, MERS-CoV nucleic acid was detected by real-time PCR in a total of 126 (1.6 %) camels."
13667,Positive camels were detected at the borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and in camels’ slaughter houses.
13668,MERS-CoV partial sequences obtained from UAE camels were clustering with human- and camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences in the same geographic area.
13669,Results provide further evidence of MERS-CoV zoonosis.
13670,"Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon."
13671,"Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection."
13672,"In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms."
13673,This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans.
13674,"Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events."
13675,This work provides a foundation for transdisciplinary investigation of spillover and synthetic theory on zoonotic transmission.
13676,"Reye’s Syndrome (RS) was first documented by Douglas Reye and colleagues in 1963 as an “encephalopathy with fatty degeneration of the viscera,” a rare entity, but one that at that time was associated with an 80% mortality rate (Reye et al., 1963)."
13677,"Although the apparent incidence and outcome of the disease have improved, it continues to be one of the major causes of noninflammatory neurologic death after a viral illness in children (Sullivan-Boylai and Corey, 1981; Heubi et al., 1987)."
13678, Rabies virus (RABV) is a neurotropic virus that causes fatal disease in humans and animals.
13679,Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear.
13680,"It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and into the CNS."
13681,"Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS."
13682,"In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV."
13683,Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced.
13684,This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.
13685,Ebola virus infections cause a deadly hemorrhagic disease for which no vaccines or therapeutics has received regulatory approval.
13686,"Here we show isolation of three (Q206, Q314 and Q411) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the surface glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus identified in West Africa in 2014 through sequential immunization of Chinese rhesus macaques and antigen-specific single B cell sorting."
13687,These mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against both pseudo and live Ebola virus independent of complement.
13688,"Biochemical, single particle EM, and mutagenesis analysis suggested Q206 and Q411 recognized novel epitopes in the head while Q314 targeted the glycan cap in the GP1 subunit."
13689,Q206 and Q411 appeared to influence GP binding to its receptor NPC1.
13690,Treatment with these mAbs provided partial but significant protection against disease in a mouse model of Ebola virus infection.
13691,These novel mAbs could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection.
13692,"This commentary highlights the article by Ng et al, emphasizing the need for autopsies to better model infectious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome."
13693,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sensors that recognize molecular patterns from viruses, bacteria, and fungi to initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens."
13694,"The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a concern for global public health, as there is a lack of efficacious vaccine platforms and antiviral therapeutic strategies."
13695,"Previously, it was shown that MyD88, an adaptor protein necessary for signaling by multiple TLRs, is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection in vivo."
13696,"Here, we demonstrate that TLR3(−/−), TLR4(−/−), and TRAM(−/−) mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection."
13697,"In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers."
13698,"Distinct alterations in inflammation were present in TRIF(−/−) mice infected with SARS-CoV, including excess infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory cell types that correlate with increased pathology of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including influenza virus infections."
13699,"Aberrant proinflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signaling programs were also noted following infection of TRIF(−/−) mice that were similar to those seen in human patients with poor disease outcome following SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection."
13700,These findings highlight the importance of TLR adaptor signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic coronavirus infections.
13701,"Viruses are frequent causes of respiratory infection, and viral respiratory infections are significant causes of hospitalization, morbidity, and sometimes mortality in a variety of patient populations."
13702,"Lung inflammation induced by infection with common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus is accompanied by increased lung production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, lipid mediators with a wide range of effects on host immune function."
13703,Deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene production often results in a dampened inflammatory response to acute infection with a respiratory virus.
13704,"These mediators may, therefore, serve as appealing therapeutic targets for disease caused by respiratory viral infection."
13705,"In 2012 a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, associated with severe respiratory disease emerged in the Arabian Peninsula."
13706,"To date, 55 human cases have been reported, including 31 fatal cases."
13707,Several of the cases were likely a result of human-to-human transmission.
13708,The emergence of this novel coronavirus prompts the need for a small animal model to study the pathogenesis of this virus and to test the efficacy of potential intervention strategies.
13709,"In this study we explored the use of Syrian hamsters as a small animal disease model, using intratracheal inoculation and inoculation via aerosol."
13710,"Clinical signs of disease, virus replication, histological lesions, cytokine upregulation nor seroconversion were observed in any of the inoculated animals, indicating that MERS-CoV does not replicate in Syrian hamsters."
13711,"In humans, infections with the human coronavirus (HCoV) strains HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 usually result in mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold."
13712,"By contrast, the CoVs responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which were discovered in Hong Kong, China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, have received global attention over the past 12 years owing to their ability to cause community and health-care-associated outbreaks of severe infections in human populations."
13713,These two viruses pose major challenges to clinical management because there are no specific antiviral drugs available.
13714,"In this Review, we summarize the epidemiology, virology, clinical features and current treatment strategies of SARS and MERS, and discuss the discovery and development of new virus-based and host-based therapeutic options for CoV infections."
13715,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrd.2015.37) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
13716,Innate immunity serves as the frontline defence against invading pathogens.
13717,"Despite decades of research, new insights are constantly challenging our understanding of host-elicited immunity during microbial infections."
13718,"Recently, two families of humoral innate immune proteins, pentraxins and collectins, have become a major focus of research in the field of innate immunity."
13719,"Pentraxins and collectins are key players in activating the humoral arm of innate immunity, taking centre stage in immunoregulation and disease modulation."
13720,"However, increasing evidence suggests that pentraxins and collectins can also mediate pathogenic effects during some infections."
13721,"Herein, we discuss the protective and pathogenic effects of pentraxins and collectins, as well as their therapeutic significance."
13722,The antimalarial drug chloroquine has been suggested as a treatment for Ebola virus infection.
13723,"Chloroquine inhibited virus replication in vitro, but only at cytotoxic concentrations."
13724,"In mouse and hamster models, treatment did not improve survival."
13725,Chloroquine is not a promising treatment for Ebola.
13726,Efforts should be directed toward other drug classes.
13727,Systems biology offers considerable promise in uncovering novel pathways by which viruses and other microbial pathogens interact with host signaling and expression networks to mediate disease severity.
13728,"In this study, we have developed an unbiased modeling approach to identify new pathways and network connections mediating acute lung injury, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen."
13729,"We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes."
13730,"This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection."
13731,"With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice."
13732,"We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity."
13733,"The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar damage and acute lung injury, following infection with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV."
13734, Previous studies show that a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus expressing VP2 of AHSV serotype 4 (MVA-VP2) induced virus neutralising antibodies in horses and protected interferon alpha receptor gene knock-out mice (IFNAR −/−) against challenge.
13735,"Follow up experiments indicated that passive transfer of antiserum, from MVA-VP2 immune donors to recipient mice 1h before challenge, conferred complete clinical protection and significantly reduced viraemia."
13736,"These studies have been extended to determine the protective effect of MVA-VP2 vaccine-induced antiserum, when administered 48h before, or 48h after challenge."
13737,"In addition, passive transfer of splenocytes was undertaken to assess if they confer any degree of immunity to immunologically naïve recipient mice."
13738,"Thus, antisera and splenocytes were collected from groups of mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-VP2, or wild type MVA (MVA-wt), for passive immunisation of recipient mice."
13739,"The latter were subsequently challenged with AHSV-4 (together with appropriate vaccinated or unvaccinated control animals) and protection was assessed by comparing clinical signs, lethality and viraemia between treated and control groups."
13740,All antiserum recipients showed high protection against disease (100% survival rates even in mice that were immunised 48h after challenge) and statistically significant reduction or viraemia in comparison with the control groups.
13741,"The mouse group receiving splenocytes from MVA-VP2 vaccinates, showed only a 40% survival rate, with a small reduction in viraemia, compared to those mice that had received splenocytes from MVA-wt vaccinates."
13742,These results confirm the primarily humoral nature of protective immunity conferred by MVA-VP2 vaccination and show the potential of administering MVA-VP2 specific antiserum as an emergency treatment for AHSV.
13743,: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a recently reported enteric disease of adult horses.
13744,"Natural infection by ECoV has been reported in adult horses worldwide, whereas experimental infection has only been reported in juvenile horses."
13745,"An experimental infection model is needed to study the clinical presentation, laboratory abnormalities, and pathophysiological changes associated with ECoV."
13746,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, hematologic, molecular, and serological features of adult horses experimentally infected with ECoV."
13747,ANIMALS: Eight adult horses.
13748,METHODS: Four horses were intragastrically infected with fecal material containing 10(9) genome equivalents of ECoV.
13749,Four additional horses were exposed daily to the feces from the experimentally‐infected horses.
13750,"Monitoring included physical examinations, as well as daily nasal swab, whole blood, and fecal collection for molecular detection of ECoV."
13751,Blood was collected every other day for hematologic analysis and weekly for serologic analysis.
13752,RESULTS: All 8 horses shed ECoV in feces.
13753,"Six of the 8 horses (75%) exhibited mild, clinical disease with soft, formed manure; 1 horse exhibited transient pyrexia."
13754,"All horses maintained total white cell counts within normal limits, but 3 horses developed transient lymphopenia."
13755,No statistically significant differences (P = .20) were observed in quantity of fecal shedding of ECoV between the 2 groups.
13756,"CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Experimental infection of adult horses with ECoV was associated with mild and self‐limiting clinical signs, transient lymphopenia, and fecal shedding of ECoV, which mimics natural infection."
13757,No differences between experimentally‐infected horses and horses exposed to ECoV‐containing feces were identified.
13758,Results of our study support a fecal‐oral route of transmission.
13759," Population of wild boar is increasing in the whole Europe, the animals migrate close to human habitats which greatly increases the possibility of natural transmission between domestic animals or humans and wild boars."
13760,"The aim of the study was to estimate in population of free-living wild boar in the Czech Republic the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A and C (RVA and RVC), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and members of family Coronaviridae (transmissible gastroenteritis virus – TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus − PEDV, porcine respiratory coronavirus – PRCV, and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus – PHEV) and Picornaviridae,(teschovirus A – PTV, sapelovirus A – PSV, and enterovirus G – EV-G)."
13761,"In our study, stool samples from 203 wild boars culled during hunting season 2014–2015 (from October to January) were examined by RT-PCR."
13762,RVA was detected in 2.5% of tested samples.
13763,"Nucleotide analysis of VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes revealed that four RVA strains belong to G4P[25]I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5, and G5P[13]I5 genotypes and phylogenetic analysis suggested close relation to porcine and human RVAs."
13764,"The prevalence of RVC in wild boar population reached 12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9%, and EV-G in 2.5% of samples."
13765,During our study no PRRSV or coronaviruses were detected.
13766,Our study provides the first evidence of RVC prevalence in wild boars and indicates that wild boars might contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses.
13767,"This chapter reviews the naturally occurring viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and parasitic diseases of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) with an emphasis on those diseases found in captive guinea pigs."
13768,"For each organism, etiology, epizootiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, pathology, diagnosis, prevention, and therapy are discussed."
13769,"Major viruses include adenoviruses, herpesviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, paramyxoviruses (including Sendai virus), and cavian leukemia virus."
13770,"Common bacterial organisms are Clostridia sp., Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bordetella, Chlamydia, Klebsiella, Lawsonia intercellularis, Leptospira, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella, Streptobacillus moniliformis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis."
13771,"Common fungal organisms include Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi."
13772,"Major protozoal diseases are Amoebiasis, Balantidiasis, Cryptosporidiosis, Eimeria, Giardiasis, Klossiella cobayae, Leishmaniasis, Toxoplasmosis, and Tritrichomonas caviae."
13773,"Common external parasites include lice (Gyropus ovalis, Gliricola porcelli and Trimenopon hispidum) and mites (Chirodiscoides caviae and Trixacarus caviae)."
13774,"Internal parasites are cestodes, Pelodera strongyloides, Baylisascaris, Paraspidodera uncinata, Trichinella, and Fasciola spp."
13775,"The majority of human emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic, with viruses originating in wild mammals of particular concern (e.g."
13776,"HIV, Ebola, SARS)(1–3)."
13777,"Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs(4)."
13778,"However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries(5–7)."
13779,"Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable."
13780,"After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range – which may reflect human-wildlife contact."
13781,We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders.
13782,We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of ‘missing viruses’ and ‘missing zoonoses’ and therefore of highest value for future surveillance.
13783,"We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people."
13784,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, originated from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz), the precursor of the human virus, approximately 100 years ago."
13785,This indicates that HIV-1 has emerged through the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to humans.
13786,"However, it remains unclear how SIVcpz has evolved into pandemic HIV-1 in humans."
13787,"To address this question, we inoculated three SIVcpz strains (MB897, EK505, and MT145), four pandemic HIV-1 strains (NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), and two nonpandemic HIV-1 strains (YBF30 and DJO0131)."
13788,"Humanized mice infected with SIVcpz strain MB897, a virus phylogenetically similar to pandemic HIV-1, exhibited a peak viral load comparable to that of mice infected with pandemic HIV-1, while peak viral loads of mice infected with SIVcpz strain EK505 or MT145 as well as nonpandemic HIV-1 strains were significantly lower."
13789,"These results suggest that SIVcpz strain MB897 is preadapted to humans, unlike the other SIVcpz strains."
13790,"Moreover, viral RNA sequencing of MB897-infected humanized mice identified a nonsynonymous mutation in env, a G413R substitution in gp120."
13791,The infectivity of the gp120 G413R mutant of MB897 was significantly higher than that of parental MB897.
13792,"Furthermore, we demonstrated that the gp120 G413R mutant of MB897 augments the capacity for viral replication in both in vitro cell cultures and humanized mice."
13793,"Taken together, this is the first experimental investigation to use an animal model to demonstrate a gain-of-function evolution of SIVcpz into pandemic HIV-1."
13794,"IMPORTANCE From the mid-20th century, humans have been exposed to the menace of infectious viral diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus."
13795,"These outbreaks of emerging/reemerging viruses can be triggered by cross-species viral transmission from wild animals to humans, or zoonoses."
13796,"HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, emerged by the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz, the HIV-1 precursor in chimpanzees, around 100 years ago."
13797,"However, the process by which SIVcpz evolved to become HIV-1 in humans remains unclear."
13798,"Here, by using a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized-mouse model, we experimentally recapitulate the evolutionary process of SIVcpz to become HIV-1."
13799,"We provide evidence suggesting that a strain of SIVcpz, MB897, preadapted to infect humans over other SIVcpz strains."
13800,We further demonstrate a gain-of-function evolution of SIVcpz in infected humanized mice.
13801,Our study reveals that pandemic HIV-1 has emerged through at least two steps: preadaptation and subsequent gain-of-function mutations.
13802, The nucleotide sequence of the unique region of coronavirus MHV-A59 mRNA 2 has been determined.
13803,Two open reading frames (ORF) are predicted: ORF1 potentially encodes a protein of 261 amino acids; its amino acid sequence contains elements which indicate nucleotide binding properties.
13804,ORF2 predicts a 413 amino acids protein; it lacks a translation initiation codon and is therefore probably a pseudogene.
13805,The amino acid sequence of ORF2 shares 30% homology with the HA1 hemagglutinin sequence of influenza C virus.
13806,A short stretch of nucleotides immediately upstream of ORF2 shares 83% homology with the MHC class I nucleotide sequences.
13807,We discuss the possibilitythat both similarities are the result of recombinations and present a model for the acquisition and the subsequent inactivation of ORF2; the model applies also to MHV-A59-related coronaviruses in which we expect ORF2 to be still functional.
13808,"Interferon-inducible p200 family protein IFI204 was reported to be involved in DNA sensing, and subsequently induces the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory mediators."
13809,"However, its function in the regulation of antiviral innate immune signaling pathway remains unclear."
13810,Here we reported a novel role of IFI204 that specifically inhibits the IRF7-mediated type I interferons response during viral infection.
13811,IFI204 and other p200 family proteins are highly expressed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.
13812,The abundant IFI204 could significantly interact with IRF7 in nucleus by its HIN domain and prevent the binding of IRF7 with its corresponding promoter.
13813,"Moreover, other p200 family proteins that possess HIN domain could also inhibit the IRF7-mediated type I interferons."
13814,"These results reveal that, besides the positive regulation function in type I interferon response at the early stage of DNA virus infection, the interferon-inducible p200 family proteins such as IFI204 could also negatively regulate the IRF7-mediated type I interferon response after RNA virus infection to avoid unnecessary host damage from hyper-inflammatory responses."
13815, Viruses with the ability to establish persistent infection in the central nervous system (CNS) can induce progressive neurologic disorders associated with diverse pathological manifestations.
13816,"Clinical, epidemiological, and virological evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses contribute to human mental diseases whose etiology remains elusive."
13817,"Therefore, the investigation of the mechanisms whereby viruses persist in the CNS and disturb normal brain function represents an area of research relevant to clinical and basic neurosciences."
13818,Borna disease virus (BDV) causes CNS disease in several vertebrate species characterized by behavioral abnormalities.
13819,"Based on its unique features, BDV represents the prototype of a new virus family."
13820,BDV provides an important model for the investigation of the mechanisms and consequences of viral persistence in the CNS.
13821,"The BDV paradigm is amenable to study virus–cell interactions in the CNS that can lead to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, immune-mediated damage, as well as alterations in cell differentiated functions that affect brain homeostasis."
13822,"Moreover, seroepidemiological data and recent molecular studies indicate that BDV is associated with certain neuropsychiatric diseases."
13823,The potential role of BDV and of other yet to be uncovered BDV-related viruses in human mental health provides additional impetus for the investigation of this novel neurotropic infectious agent.
13824,"Acute viral pneumonia is an important cause of acute lung injury (ALI), although not enough is known about the exact incidence of viral infection in ALI."
13825,"Polymerase chain reaction-based assays, direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, and viral cultures can detect viruses in samples from the human respiratory tract, but the presence of the virus does not prove it to be a pathogen, nor does it give information regarding the interaction of viruses with the host immune response and bacterial flora of the respiratory tract."
13826,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a better understanding of how viral pathogens mediate lung injury.
13827,"Although the viruses initially infect the respiratory epithelium, the relative role of epithelial damage and endothelial dysfunction has not been well defined."
13828,The inflammatory host immune response to H1N1 infection is a major contributor to lung injury.
13829,The SARS coronavirus causes lung injury and inflammation in part through actions on the nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway.
13830,The lessons learned from the pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and H1N1 capture key principles of virally mediated ALI.
13831,There are pathogen-specific pathways underlying virally mediated ALI that converge onto a common end pathway resulting in diffuse alveolar damage.
13832,"In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care."
13833,"There is little evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial, and they might be harmful."
13834,"Future therapeutic strategies may be targeted to specific pathogens, the pathogenetic pathways in the host immune response, or enhancing repair and regeneration of tissue damage."
13835," Most pandemics—eg, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza—originate in animals, are caused by viruses, and are driven to emerge by ecological, behavioural, or socioeconomic changes."
13836,"Despite their substantial effects on global public health and growing understanding of the process by which they emerge, no pandemic has been predicted before infecting human beings."
13837,"We review what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts that they originate in, and the factors that drive their emergence."
13838,"We discuss challenges to their control and new efforts to predict pandemics, target surveillance to the most crucial interfaces, and identify prevention strategies."
13839,"New mathematical modelling, diagnostic, communications, and informatics technologies can identify and report hitherto unknown microbes in other species, and thus new risk assessment approaches are needed to identify microbes most likely to cause human disease."
13840,We lay out a series of research and surveillance opportunities and goals that could help to overcome these challenges and move the global pandemic strategy from response to pre-emption.
13841,The risk of transmission of a viral haemorrhagic fever infection in a United Kingdom laboratory
13842,"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent of the large SARS outbreak in 2003, originated in bats."
13843,"Many SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been detected in bats, particularly those that reside in China, Europe, and Africa."
13844,"To further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017."
13845,"PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes."
13846,"Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and ZC45) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs)."
13847,"These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China."
13848,"Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy."
13849,"Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of SL-CoVs using suckling rats as an animal model."
13850,"The exposure of wild carnivores to viral pathogens, with emphasis on parvovirus (CPV/FPLV), was assessed based on the molecular screening of tissue samples from 128 hunted or accidentally road-killed animals collected in Portugal from 2008 to 2011, including Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon, n = 99), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n = 19), stone marten (Martes foina, n = 3), common genet (Genetta genetta, n = 3) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles, n = 4)."
13851,"A high prevalence of parvovirus DNA (63%) was detected among all surveyed species, particularly in mongooses (58%) and red foxes (79%), along with the presence of CPV/FPLV circulating antibodies that were identified in 90% of a subset of parvovirus-DNA positive samples."
13852,"Most specimens were extensively autolysed, restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation."
13853,"Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR possibly correspond to viral DNA reminiscent from previous infections."
13854,"The molecular characterization of viruses, based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene, allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red fox’s as feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and one stone marten’s as newCPV-2b type."
13855,"The genetic similarity found between the FPLV viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in Portugal and publicly available comparable sequences, suggests a closer genetic relatedness among FPLV circulating in Portugal."
13856,"Although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established, this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread, potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species, such as the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus)."
13857,Emerging viral infections represent a public health risk pointed out by the spreading of pathogens with potential zoonotic risk.
13858,"Moreover, the risk of zoonosis has probably been underestimated in occupational settings."
13859,A literature review between 2007 and 2018 was performed to identify evidences concerning the epidemiological associations between some emerging viruses and occupational diseases.
13860,Observational studies and case-reports were selected and analyzed.
13861,"West Nile Virus (WNV) disease, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) disease and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection were included in the review for their potential zoonotic transmission."
13862,"The most important risk factor for acquiring WNV infection and CCHF infection is the exposure to infected mosquitoes and ticks, respectively; therefore, outdoor workers are at risk of infection."
13863,"HEV is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, that can become infected through waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic transmission routes."
13864,"A total of 10, 34 and 45 eligible studies for WNV, CCHF virus (CCFHV) and HEV, respectively, were analyzed by year, country, study design, risk group and outcomes."
13865,"The occupational risk groups mainly included farm and agricultural workers, veterinarians, slaughterers, animal handlers, healthcare workers and soldiers."
13866,These findings support the need to develop effective interventions to prevent transmission of emerging viruses.
13867,"Immune reactivity in the retina can be critically important in inflammation and infections, but regulation of this response is essential."
13868,"The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), a unique retinal cell, displays a number of essential functions to support the health of the retina."
13869,"In this review, we highlight how the RPE cell plays a pivotal role in immune defense."
13870,"The RPE cell orchestrates both innate and adaptive immunity since it expresses TLRs, complement components, MHC class I and II molecules, and serves as an antigen presenting cell."
13871,"Moreover, both of these immune responses result in the production of a plethora of cytokines, mainly proinflammatory."
13872,"In order to counteract these inflammatory factors and silence unwanted immune reactivity, the RPE cell also generates suppressive molecules."
13873,"Recently, chronic immune reactivity has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD)."
13874,Current evidence suggests that the generation of excessive retinal inflammation may be the consequence of a loss of RPE immunosuppressive factors.
13875,"Herein, we summarize the varied interactions of the RPE cell with the immune response and highlight how the RPE cell survives and participates in this dynamic environment."
13876,"Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, 24,70 chlamydia, 18,19,43,55,116 and mycoplasma 61 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma."
13877,Viruses have been demonstrated to be associated with asthma epidemiologically in at least two ways (Fig.
13878,1).
13879,"First, during infancy, certain viruses have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype."
13880,"Second, in patients, particularly children, with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations of airway obstruction that may result in frequent outpatient visits or hospitalizations."
13881,"24,55,56,57 This article reviews these two areas by focusing first on mechanisms by which virus infections may lead to the development of asthma in infants and children and, second, on mechanisms by which virus infections may produce acute asthmatic symptoms in patients who already have established disease."
13882,We used data on feeding practices and domestic animal health gathered from 207 Bangladeshi villages to identify any association between grazing dropped fruit found on the ground or owners directly feeding bat- or bird-bitten fruit and animal health.
13883,"We compared mortality and morbidity in domestic animals using a mixed effects model controlling for village clustering, herd size, and proxy measures of household wealth."
13884,Thirty percent of household heads reported that their animals grazed on dropped fruit and 20% reported that they actively fed bitten fruit to their domestic herds.
13885,"Household heads allowing their cattle to graze on dropped fruit were more likely to report an illness within their herd (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.02–1.31)."
13886,"Household heads directly feeding goats bitten fruit were more likely to report illness (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16–1.57) and deaths (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.13–2.4)."
13887,Reporting of illnesses and deaths among goats rose as the frequency of feeding bitten fruit increased.
13888,One possible explanation for this finding is the transmission of bat pathogens to domestic animals via bitten fruit consumption.
13889, Myelin basic protein (MBP) appears frequently in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice with chronic demyelination following intracerebral infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV); antibody to MBP can frequently be found in the sera.
13890,The peaks of the immune responses to both MBP and TMEV coincide with the time course of the clinical signs of disease.
13891,Adsorption of mouse sera with TMEV or MBP indicate the non-identity of the antigens and the specificity of the antisera as measured by ELISA.
13892,Immunoblot analysis of sera confirmed the ELISA findings.
13893,The mechanism of induction of antibody directed against MBP and its role in TMEV-associated demyelination remain to be determined.
13894, We recently established a mouse model (288–330+/+) that developed acute respiratory disease resembling human pathology following infection with a high dose (5 × 106 PFU) of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (icMERSma1).
13895,"Although this high dose conferred fatal respiratory disease in mice, achieving similar pathology at lower viral doses may more closely reflect naturally acquired infections."
13896,Through continued adaptive evolution of icMERSma1 we generated a novel mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (maM35c4) capable of achieving severe respiratory disease at doses between 103 and 105 PFU.
13897,Novel mutations were identified in the maM35c4 genome that may be responsible for eliciting etiologies of acute respiratory distress syndrome at 10–1000 fold lower viral doses.
13898,"Importantly, comparative genetics of the two mouse-adapted MERS strains allowed us to identify specific mutations that remained fixed through an additional 20 cycles of adaptive evolution."
13899,Our data indicate that the extent of MERS-CoV adaptation determines the minimal infectious dose required to achieve severe respiratory disease.
13900,"Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection causes hand, foot and mouth disease in children under 6 years old and this infection occasionally induces severe neurological complications."
13901,No vaccines or drugs are clinical available to control EV71 epidemics.
13902,"In present study, we show that treatment with lycorine reduced the viral cytopathic effect (CPE) on rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells by inhibiting virus replication."
13903,Analysis of this inhibitory effect of lycorine on viral proteins synthesis suggests that lycorine blocks the elongation of the viral polyprotein during translation.
13904,"Lycorine treatment of mice challenged with a lethal dose of EV71 resulted in reduction of mortality, clinical scores and pathological changes in the muscles of mice, which were achieved through inhibition of viral replication."
13905,"When mice were infected with a moderate dose of EV71, lycorine treatment was able to protect them from paralysis."
13906,Lycorine may be a potential drug candidate for the clinical treatment of EV71-infected patients.
13907,"siRNA approaches have demonstrated promise in treating viral infections in animal models, but poor delivery limits clinical application."
13908,"In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Beloor et al."
13909,"(2018) report that nose-to-brain delivery of viral-targeted siRNA cures mice from West Nile virus encephalitis, with potential implications for human infection."
13910,"To assess the temporal dynamics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in dromedary camels, specimens were collected at 1–2 month intervals from 2 independent groups of animals during April 2013–May 2014 in Al-Ahsa Province, Saudi Arabia, and tested for MERS-CoV RNA by reverse transcription PCR."
13911,"Of 96 live camels, 28 (29.2%) nasal swab samples were positive; of 91 camel carcasses, 56 (61.5%) lung tissue samples were positive."
13912,Positive samples were more commonly found among young animals (<4 years of age) than adults (>4 years of age).
13913,The proportions of positive samples varied by month for both groups; detection peaked during November 2013 and January 2014 and declined in March and May 2014.
13914,These findings further our understanding of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels and may help inform intervention strategies to reduce zoonotic infections.
13915,It has been documented that the epidemiological characteristics of human infections with H7N9 differ significantly between H5N1.
13916,"However, potential factors that may explain the different spatial distributions remain unexplored."
13917,"We use boosted regression tree (BRT) models to explore the association of agro-ecological, environmental and meteorological variables with the occurrence of human cases of H7N9 and H5N1, and map the probabilities of occurrence of human cases."
13918,"Live poultry markets, density of human, coverage of built-up land, relative humidity and precipitation were significant predictors for both."
13919,"In addition, density of poultry, coverage of shrub and temperature played important roles for human H7N9 infection, whereas human H5N1 infection was associated with coverage of forest and water body."
13920,"Based on the risks and distribution of ecological characteristics which may facilitate the circulation of the two viruses, we found Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, along with a few spots on the southeast coastline, to be the high risk areas for H7N9 and H5N1."
13921,"Additional, H5N1 risk spots were identified in eastern Sichuan and southern Yunnan Provinces."
13922,Surveillance of the two viruses needs to be enhanced in these high risk areas to reduce the risk of future epidemics of avian influenza in China.
13923, Full-genome sequences have been used to monitor the fine-scale dynamics of epidemics caused by RNA viruses.
13924,"However, the ability of this approach to confidently reconstruct transmission trees is limited by the knowledge of the genetic diversity of viruses that exist within different epidemiological units."
13925,"In order to address this question, this study investigated the variability of 45 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome sequences (from 33 animals) that were collected during 2007 from eight premises (10 different herds) in the United Kingdom."
13926,Bayesian and statistical parsimony analysis demonstrated that these sequences exhibited clustering which was consistent with a transmission scenario describing herd-to-herd spread of the virus.
13927,"As an alternative to analysing all of the available samples in future epidemics, the impact of randomly selecting one sequence from each of these herds was used to assess cost-effective methods that might be used to infer transmission trees during FMD outbreaks."
13928,"Using these approaches, 85% and 91% of the resulting topologies were either identical or differed by only one edge from a reference tree comprising all of the sequences generated within the outbreak."
13929,"The sequence distances that accrued during sequential transmission events between epidemiological units was estimated to be 4.6 nucleotides, although the genetic variability between viruses recovered from chronic carrier animals was higher than between viruses from animals with acute-stage infection: an observation which poses challenges for the use of simple approaches to infer transmission trees."
13930,"This study helps to develop strategies for sampling during FMD outbreaks, and provides data that will guide the development of further models to support control policies in the event of virus incursions into FMD free countries."
13931,: Disseminated or fatal Zika virus (ZIKV) infections were reported in immunosuppressed patients.
13932,Existing interferon-signaling/receptor-deficient mouse models may not be suitable for evaluating treatment effects of recombinant interferons.
13933,METHODS: We developed a novel mouse model for ZIKV infection by immunosuppressing BALB/c mice with dexamethasone.
13934,RESULTS: Dexamethasone-immunosuppressed male mice (6–8 weeks) developed disseminated infection as evidenced by the detection of ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and high viral loads in multiple organs.
13935,"They had ≥ 10% weight loss and high clinical scores soon after dexamethasone withdrawal (10 dpi), which warranted euthanasia at 12 dpi."
13936,Viral loads in blood and most tissues at 5 dpi were significantly higher than those at 12 dpi (P < 0.05).
13937,"Histological examination revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs, and CD45 + and CD8 + inflammatory cells were seen in the testis."
13938,These findings suggested that clinical deterioration occurred during viral clearance by host immune response.
13939,Type I interferon treatments improved clinical outcome of mice (100% vs 0% survival).
13940,"CONCLUSIONS: Besides virus dissemination, inflammation of various tissues, especially orchitis, may be potential complications of ZIKV infection with significant implications on disease transmission and male fertility."
13941,Interferon treatment should be considered in patients at high risks for ZIKV-associated complications when the potential benefits outweigh the side effects of treatment.
13942,"To understand the pathogenesis and develop an animal model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Frankfurt 1 SARS-CoV isolate was passaged serially in young F344 rats."
13943,Young rats were susceptible to SARS-CoV but cleared the virus rapidly within 3 to 5 days of intranasal inoculation.
13944,"After 10 serial passages, replication and virulence of SARS-CoV were increased in the respiratory tract of young rats without clinical signs."
13945,"By contrast, adult rats infected with the passaged virus showed respiratory symptoms and severe pathological lesions in the lung."
13946,Levels of inflammatory cytokines in sera and lung tissues were significantly higher in adult F344 rats than in young rats.
13947,"During in vivo passage of SARS-CoV, a single amino acid substitution was introduced within the binding domain of the viral spike protein recognizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known as a SARS-CoV receptor."
13948,The rat-passaged virus more efficiently infected CHO cells expressing rat ACE2 than did the original isolate.
13949,These results strongly indicate that host and virus factors such as advanced age and virus adaptation are critical for the development of SARS in rats.
13950,Canine viral diarrhea is a severe disease in dogs worldwide.
13951,"The role of canine parvovirus (CPV) in canine viral diarrhea is a common health problem in dogs, attracting major concern from veterinarians and dog owners across China."
13952,"In this mini-review, we summarize the CPV epidemiology in China, including its origin, prevalence, coinfection, and the genetic evolution of the virus."
13953,"The review reveals the correlation between CPV-2 infection and seasonality, a dog's age/gender/breed/vaccination; that CPV-2 is the main causative agent of canine diarrhea in Northeast China and that coinfection with other pathogens is a common occurrence; the predominant CPV epidemic strains were the new CPV-2a, and CPV-2c has shown significant growth trends since 2010."
13954,This mini-review will provide valuable information for CPV infections across China and other countries.
13955,"Fusion between the viral and target cell membranes is an obligatory step for the infectivity of all enveloped virus, and blocking this process is a clinically validated therapeutic strategy."
13956,"Viral fusion is driven by specialized proteins which, although specific to each virus, act through a common mechanism, the formation of a complex between two heptad repeat (HR) regions."
13957,"The HR regions are initially separated in an intermediate termed “prehairpin”, which bridges the viral and cell membranes, and then fold onto each other to form a 6-helical bundle (6HB), driving the two membranes to fuse."
13958,HR-derived peptides can inhibit viral infectivity by binding to the prehairpin intermediate and preventing its transition to the 6HB.
13959,The antiviral activity of HR-derived peptides differs considerably among enveloped viruses.
13960,"For weak inhibitors, potency can be increased by peptide engineering strategies, but sequence-specific optimization is time-consuming."
13961,"In seeking ways to increase potency without changing the native sequence, we previously reported that attachment to the HR peptide of a cholesterol group (”cholesterol-tagging”) dramatically increases its antiviral potency, and simultaneously increases its half-life in vivo."
13962,"We show here that antiviral potency may be increased by combining cholesterol-tagging with dimerization of the HR-derived sequence, using as examples human parainfluenza virus, Nipah virus, and HIV-1."
13963,"Together, cholesterol-tagging and dimerization may represent strategies to boost HR peptide potency to levels that in some cases may be compatible with in vivo use, possibly contributing to emergency responses to outbreaks of existing or novel viruses."
13964,"The development of novel broad-spectrum, antiviral agents against H5N1 infection is urgently needed."
13965,"In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory activities and protective effect of Eupatorium adenophorum polysaccharide (EAP) against the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype influenza virus."
13966,"EAP treatment significantly increased the production of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ both in vivo and in vitro as measured by qPCR and ELISA."
13967,"In a mouse infection model, intranasal administration of EAP at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight prior to H5N1 viral challenge efficiently inhibited viral replication, decreased lung lesions, and increased survival rate."
13968,"We further evaluated the innate immune recognition of EAP, as this process is regulated primarily Dectin-1 and mannose receptor (MR)."
13969,These results indicate that EAP may have immunomodulatory properties and a potential prophylactic effect against H5N1 influenza infection.
13970,Our investigation suggests an alternative strategy for the development of novel antiinfluenza agents and benefits of E. adenophorum products.
13971, The dynamics of H5N1 influenza virus pathogenesis are multifaceted and can be seen as an emergent property that cannot be comprehended without looking at the system as a whole.
13972,"In past years, most of the high-throughput studies on H5N1–host interactions have focused on the host transcriptomic response, at the cellular or the lung tissue level."
13973,These studies pointed out that the dynamics and magnitude of the innate immune response and immune cell infiltration is critical to H5N1 pathogenesis.
13974,"However, viral–host interactions are multidimensional and advances in technologies are creating new possibilities to systematically measure additional levels of ’omic data (e.g."
13975,"proteomic, metabolomic, and RNA profiling) at each temporal and spatial scale (from the single cell to the organism) of the host response."
13976,Natural host genetic variation represents another dimension of the host response that determines pathogenesis.
13977,Systems biology models of H5N1 disease aim at understanding and predicting pathogenesis through integration of these different dimensions by using intensive computational modeling.
13978,"In this review, we describe the importance of ’omic studies for providing a more comprehensive view of infection and mathematical models that are being developed to integrate these data."
13979,This review provides a roadmap for what needs to be done in the future and what computational strategies should be used to build a global model of H5N1 pathogenesis.
13980,It is time for systems biology of H5N1 pathogenesis to take center stage as the field moves toward a more comprehensive view of virus–host interactions.
13981,": For most classes of drugs, rapid development of therapeutics to treat emerging infections is challenged by the timelines needed to identify compounds with the desired efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles."
13982,Fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases.
13983,"METHODS: In this study, we deployed a platform to generate, test, and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus."
13984,We obtained specific anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses.
13985,"RESULTS: Of the antibody clones isolated, 3 were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering FcγRIIIa."
13986,"Binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments."
13987,"When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 antibodies protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent."
13988,"CONCLUSIONS: This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities, and demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs."
13989,It is now undergoing testing in normal healthy volunteers in preparation for potential use in future Ebola epidemics.
13990,"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a complex viral agent that causes a variety of clinical manifestations in cats, commonly known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)."
13991,It is recognized that FCoV can occur in two different serotypes.
13992,"However, differences in the S protein are much more than serological or antigenic variants, resulting in the effective presence of two distinct viruses."
13993,"Here, we review the distinct differences in the S proteins of these viruses, which are likely to translate into distinct biological outcomes."
13994,"We introduce a new concept related to the non-taxonomical classification and differentiation among FCoVs by analyzing and comparing the genetic, structural, and functional characteristics of FCoV and the FCoV S protein among the two serotypes and FCoV biotypes."
13995,"Based on our analysis, we suggest that our understanding of FIP needs to consider whether the presence of these two distinct viruses has implications in clinical settings."
13996,HCoV-NL63 is a recently identified respiratory virus.
13997,Its pathogenesis has not been fully unraveled because an animal model is currently lacking.
13998,"Here we examined whether rhesus macaques encounter HCoV-NL63 infections during life, by examining the levels of antibodies to HCoV-NL63 in time."
13999,"The animals were followed for 7 up till 19 years, and in three animals we observed a steep rise in antibodies during follow up, indicative of a natural infection with HCoV-NL63."
14000,The global trade in wildlife has historically contributed to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.
14001,"The United States is the world's largest importer of wildlife and wildlife products, yet minimal pathogen surveillance has precluded assessment of the health risks posed by this practice."
14002,This report details the findings of a pilot project to establish surveillance methodology for zoonotic agents in confiscated wildlife products.
14003,"Initial findings from samples collected at several international airports identified parts originating from nonhuman primate (NHP) and rodent species, including baboon, chimpanzee, mangabey, guenon, green monkey, cane rat and rat."
14004,Pathogen screening identified retroviruses (simian foamy virus) and/or herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus and lymphocryptovirus) in the NHP samples.
14005,"These results are the first demonstration that illegal bushmeat importation into the United States could act as a conduit for pathogen spread, and suggest that implementation of disease surveillance of the wildlife trade will help facilitate prevention of disease emergence."
14006,We recently described an immunocompetent Syrian hamster model for oncolytic adenoviruses (Ads) that permits virus replication in tumor cells as well as some normal tissues.
14007,"This model allows exploration of interactions between the virus, tumor, normal organs, and host immune system that could not be examined in the immunodeficient or nonpermissive animal models previously used in the oncolytic Ad field."
14008,Here we asked whether the immune response to oncolytic Ad enhances or limits antitumor efficacy.
14009,We first determined that cyclophosphamide (CP) is a potent immunosuppressive agent in the Syrian hamster and that CP alone had no effect on tumor growth.
14010,"Importantly, we found that the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic Ads was significantly enhanced in immunosuppressed animals."
14011,"In animals that received virus therapy plus immunosuppression, significant differences were observed in tumor histology, and in many cases little viable tumor remained."
14012,"Notably, we also determined that immunosuppression allowed intratumoral virus levels to remain elevated for prolonged periods."
14013,"Although favorable tumor responses can be achieved in immunocompetent animals, the rate of virus clearance from the tumor may lead to varied antitumor efficacy."
14014,"Immunosuppression, therefore, allows sustained Ad replication and oncolysis, which leads to substantially improved suppression of tumor growth."
14015,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic betacoronavirus that was first detected in humans in 2012 as a cause of severe acute respiratory disease.
14016,"As of July 28, 2017, there have been 2,040 confirmed cases with 712 reported deaths."
14017,"While many infections have been fatal, there have also been a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases discovered through monitoring and contact tracing."
14018,New Zealand white rabbits are a possible model for asymptomatic infection with MERS-CoV.
14019,"In order to discover more about non-lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with MERS-CoV would protect against reinfection, we inoculated rabbits with MERS-CoV and monitored the antibody and inflammatory response."
14020,"Following intranasal infection, rabbits developed a transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high levels of viral RNA, viral antigen, and perivascular inflammation in multiple lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs."
14021,The rabbits developed antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutralizing activity and the animals were not protected from reinfection.
14022,"In fact, reinfection resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation, without an associated increase in viral RNA titers."
14023,"Interestingly, passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to naïve rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection."
14024,We further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of complement proteins compared to primary infection.
14025,"However, reinfection elicited neutralizing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge."
14026,"Our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to MERS-CoV who fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response, or persons whose neutralizing antibody titers have waned, may be at risk for severe lung disease on re-exposure to MERS-CoV."
14027," Serum neutralization testing was used to determine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) titers of up to 10 sows per herd (mean 8.7, median 10) for 392 herds that participated in the 3 month monitoring of sows and litters in the National Swine Survey."
14028,"Of the sampled herds, 101 (25.8%) had sow seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10 and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) were seronegative."
14029,"For evaluation of risk factors for TGE seropositivity, analysis was restricted to herds with at least five tested sows and either 0% or at least 20% seropositive sows."
14030,"In the logistic regression analysis, a herd was considered seropositive if at least 20% of sampled females had titers of 1: 8 or higher (n = 160), and a herd was seronegative if all females had titers of under 1: 8 (n = 178)."
14031,"Factors considered for inclusion in logistic regression models included breeding herd size, biosecurity measures, pig introductions and movements, and access of possible nonporcine reservoirs to the facilities with pigs."
14032,"After controlling for the effects of season, number of samples tested and TGE vaccination history, large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows compared with the reference category of 100–199 sows) and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-specific pathogen free (SPF) herds were associated with significantly (P<0.05) higher odds of herd seropositivity (odds ratios 4.9 and 3.9, respectively)."
14033,There was some evidence (P = 0.08) of an increased risk of seropositivity when there were more than two swine herds within a 3 mile radius of the study herd.
14034, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is considered an emergent pathogen associated with high economic losses in many pig rearing areas.
14035,Recently it has been suggested that PEDV could be transmitted to naïve pig populations through inclusion of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) into the nursery diet which led to a ban of SDPP in several areas in North America and Europe.
14036,"To determine the effect of spray-drying on PEDV infectivity, 3-week-old pigs were intragastrically inoculated with (1) raw porcine plasma spiked with PEDV (RAW-PEDV-CONTROL), (2) porcine plasma spiked with PEDV and then spray dried (SD-PEDV-CONTROL), (3) raw plasma from PEDV infected pigs (RAW-SICK), (4) spray-dried plasma from PEDV infected pigs (SD-SICK), or (5) spray-dried plasma from PEDV negative pigs (SD-NEG-CONTROL)."
14037,"For the spray-drying process, a tabletop spray-dryer with industry-like settings for inlet and outlet temperatures was used."
14038,"In the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group, PEDV RNA was present in feces at day post infection (dpi) 3 and the pigs seroconverted by dpi 14."
14039,"In contrast, PEDV RNA in feces was not detected in any of the pigs in the other groups including the SD-PEDV-CONTROL group and none of the pigs had seroconverted by termination of the project at dpi 28."
14040,This work provides direct evidence that the experimental spray-drying process used in this study was effective in inactivating infectious PEDV in the plasma.
14041,"Additionally, plasma collected from PEDV infected pigs at peak disease did not contain infectious PEDV."
14042,These findings suggest that the risk for PEDV transmission through commercially produced SDPP is minimal.
14043, A Mamastrovirus was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).
14044,"Five young adult and two adult cheetahs presented with lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation over an 11-day period."
14045,Fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture.
14046,"Electron microscopy results revealed particles morphologically consistent with an astrovirus, and no other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were identified."
14047,"The astrovirus was confirmed and sequenced using consensus astroviral PCR, resulting in a 367 base pair partial RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) product and a 628 base pair partial capsid product."
14048,Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the RdRp and the capsid protein segments.
14049,"All animals were monitored and treated with bismuth subsalicylate tablets (524mg PO BID for 5 days), and recovered without additional intervention."
14050,This is the first report we are aware of documenting an astrovirus outbreak in cheetah.
14051,"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is endemic in feral cat populations and cat colonies, frequently preceding outbreaks of fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)."
14052,FCoV exhibits 2 biotypes: the pathogenic disease and a benign infection with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV).
14053,"Uncertainty remains regarding whether genetically distinctive avirulent and virulent forms coexist or whether an avirulent form mutates in vivo, causing FIP."
14054,"To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses."
14055,Viral sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and nonstructural protein 7b genes.
14056,These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations.
14057,"In addition, 5 membrane protein amino acid residues with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with FIP."
14058,These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent FIP-associated FCoV.
14059,The use of negative contrast electronmicroscopy of stool suspension in the investigation of the aetiology of childhood gastroenteritis has led to the recognition of a number of candidate viral agents.
14060,"There is convincing evidence that rotavirus is the single most important cause of community acquired gastroenteritis, and is responsible for some nosocomial outbreaks."
14061,"The epidemiology of rotavirus acquisition, differential clinical susceptibilities of young and older infants, pathogenesis of disease, mechanisms of immunity and breast milk protection, and the role of different viral serotypes are aspects as yet poorly understood; and attempts to propagate human rotavirus in tissue culture have met with only limited success."
14062,"Moreover, the aetiologically unaccountable one third of cases of infantile diarrhoea, and the association of enteritis with up to six other virus-like particles add to the complexity of the problem."
14063,"This review considers the available data from human and animal studies, and based on the experience of ourselves and others comments on the present state of knowledge and trends in continuing research."
14064, Structural principles underlying the composition of protective antiviral monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails are poorly defined.
14065,"Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic mAb cocktail against Ebola virus."
14066,We systematically analyzed the antibody repertoire in human survivors and identified a pair of potently neutralizing mAbs that cooperatively bound to the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP).
14067,"High-resolution structures revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, molecular mimicry was a major feature of mAb-GP interactions."
14068,Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region.
14069,"mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520."
14070,Remodeling of the glycan cap structures by the cocktail enabled enhanced GP binding and virus neutralization.
14071,The cocktail demonstrated resistance to virus escape and protected non-human primates (NHPs) against Ebola virus disease.
14072,These data illuminate structural principles of antibody cooperativity with implications for development of antiviral immunotherapeutics.
14073,": Given that there is a possibility of a human H5N1 pandemic and the fact that the recent H5N1 viruses are resistant to the anti-viral drugs, newer strategies for effective therapy are warranted."
14074,Previous studies show that single mAbs in immune prophylaxis can be protective against H5N1 infection.
14075,But a single mAb may not be effective in neutralization of a broad range of different strains of H5N1 and control of potential neutralization escape mutants.
14076,METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected two mAbs which recognized different epitopes on the hemagglutinin molecule.
14077,"These two mAbs could each neutralize in vitro escape mutants to the other and in combination could effectively neutralize viruses from clades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7 and 8 of influenza A H5N1 viruses."
14078,"This combination of chimeric mAbs when administered passively, pre or post challenge with 10 MLD50 (50% mouse lethal dose) HPAI H5N1 influenza A viruses could protect 100% of the mice from two different clades of viruses (clades 1 and 2.1)."
14079,We also tested the efficacy of a single dose of the combination of mAbs versus two doses.
14080,Two doses of the combination therapy not only affected early clearance of the virus from the lung but could completely prevent lung pathology of the H5N1 infected mice.
14081,No escape variants were detected after therapy.
14082,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies provide proof of concept that the synergistic action of two or more mAbs in combination is required for preventing the generation of escape mutants and also to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of passive therapy against H5N1 infection.
14083,Combination therapy may allow for a lower dose of antibody to be administered for passive therapy of influenza infection and hence can be made available at reduced economic costs during an outbreak.
14084,The consequences of adventitious infectious agents upon the interpretation of toxicology studies performed in rats and mice are incompletely understood.
14085,Several prevalent murine pathogens cause alterations of the respiratory system that can confuse the assessment of chemically induced airway injury.
14086,In some instances the pathogenesis of infection with these agents has been relatively well studied in the lower respiratory tract.
14087,"However, there are few well-controlled studies that have examined the upper respiratory region, which result in interpretive problems for toxicologic pathologists."
14088,The conduct and interpretation of both short-term and chronic rodent bioassays can be compromised by both the clinical and subclinical manifestations of infectious diseases.
14089,This paper reviews several important infectious diseases of the upper airway of rats and mice and discusses the potential influence of these conditions on the results of toxicology studies.
14090,"The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the New World has led to more than 200,000 human infections."
14091,"Perinatal infection can cause severe neurological complications, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and in adults there is an association with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)."
14092,ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes sp.
14093,"mosquitoes, yet little is known about its enzootic cycle in which transmission is thought to occur between arboreal Aedes sp."
14094,mosquitos and non-human primates.
14095,"In the 1950s and ‘60s, several bat species were shown to be naturally and experimentally susceptible to ZIKV with acute viremia and seroconversion, and some developed neurological disease with viral antigen detected in the brain."
14096,"Because of ZIKV emergence in the Americas, we sought to determine susceptibility of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), one of the most common bats in the New World."
14097,Bats were inoculated with ZIKV PRVABC59 but did not show signs of disease.
14098,"Bats held to 28 days post-inoculation (PI) had detectable antibody by ELISA and viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, saliva and urine in some of the bats."
14099,"Immunoreactivity using polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibody was detected in testes, brain, lung and salivary glands plus scrotal skin."
14100,"Tropism for mononuclear cells, including macrophages/microglia and fibroblasts, was seen in the aforementioned organs in addition to testicular Leydig cells."
14101,The virus likely localized to the brain via infection of Iba1(+) macrophage/microglial cells.
14102,"Jamaican fruit bats, therefore, may be a useful animal model for the study of ZIKV infection."
14103,"This work also raises the possibility that bats may have a role in Zika virus ecology in endemic regions, and that ZIKV may pose a wildlife disease threat to bat populations."

14105,Studies in which Drosophila melanogaster individuals carrying transgenes of animal viruses were used to analyze the action of animal viral proteins on the cell are reviewed.
14106,"The data presented suggest that host specificity of viruses is determined by their proteins responsible for the penetration of the virus into the cell, while viral proteins responsible for interactions with the host cell are much less host-specific."
14107,"Due to this, the model of Drosophila with its developed system of searching for genetic interactions can be used to find intracellular targets for the action of viral proteins of the second group."
14108,  This chapter describes how the poor health of a laboratory animal can adversely the experimental models used in antimicrobial research.
14109,"Concerns for the health of laboratory animals have mostly focused on spontaneous infections, although disease in laboratory animals may also be caused by genetic or environmental determinants."
14110,"The presence of various pathogenic microorganisms may cause changes in the organs, resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the pathological diagnosis included in the evaluation of many microbiological models."
14111,The immune system may be modulated by spontaneous infections in the absence of clinical disease.
14112,"This effect may be either suppressive or activating or both at the same time, but on different parts of the immune system."
14113,"Some microorganisms have a specific effect on enzymatic, haematological, and other parameters, which are monitored in the animal during an experiment."
14114,Organic function disturbances may change the outcome of the experiment without the knowledge of the scientist.
14115,"Spontaneous infections in an experimental infection model may also compete with the experimental infection, which in the worst cases may fail."
14116,"Microorganisms present in the animal may contaminate samples and tissue specimens, such as cells and sera."
14117,"This may complicate the in vitro maintenance of cell lines, and may interfere with experiments performed on cell cultures or isolated organs."
14118,"To avoid disease, microbial interference, and zoonoses, laboratory animals are produced according to a three-step principle, which include rederivation, barrier protection, and health monitoring."
14119,Rederivation means the production of animals to initiate breeding colonies by either caesarian section or embryo transfer.
14120,"Innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense resulting, in most cases, in pathogen clearance with minimal clinical consequences."
14121,Viruses have developed diverse strategies to subvert host defense mechanisms and increase their survival.
14122,"In the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as a model, we previously reported that accessory gene 7 counteracts the host antiviral response by associating with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c)."
14123,"In the present work, the effect of the absence of gene 7 on the host cell, during infection, was further analyzed by transcriptomic analysis."
14124,"The pattern of gene expression of cells infected with a recombinant mutant TGEV, lacking gene 7 expression (rTGEV-Δ7), was compared to that of cells infected with the parental virus (rTGEV-wt)."
14125,"Genes involved in the immune response, the interferon response, and inflammation were upregulated during TGEV infection in the absence of gene 7."
14126,An exacerbated innate immune response during infection with rTGEV-Δ7 virus was observed both in vitro and in vivo.
14127,An increase in macrophage recruitment and activation in lung tissues infected with rTGEV-Δ7 virus was observed compared to cells infected with the parental virus.
14128,"In summary, the absence of protein 7 both in vitro and in vivo led to increased proinflammatory responses and acute tissue damage after infection."
14129,"In a porcine animal model, which is immunologically similar to humans, we present a novel example of how viral proteins counteract host antiviral pathways to determine the infection outcome and pathogenesis."
14130," Astroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses."
14131,"Their genomes contain three open reading frames, but the exact number of encoded proteins remains unknown."
14132,"Astroviruses were originally identified in association with childhood diarrhea; subsequently, they have been identified as a common enteric virus infecting children under the age of 2."
14133,"Infection is not restricted to humans, however, and astroviruses have been found in widespread mammalian and avian species."
14134,"Generally, infection causes a mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, although infection can result in nephritis, hepatitis, and encephalitis in certain host species."
14135,Astrovirus pathogenicity and immune response is only poorly characterized and may differ between mammalian and avian species.
14136,"In this article, the current knowledge of astroviruses is reviewed, including their molecular virology, viral evolution, pathogenesis, and immune response."
14137,ABSTRACTThe respiratory tract surface is protected from inhaled pathogens by a secreted layer of mucus that is rich in mucin glycoproteins.
14138,Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood.
14139,"Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
14140,"Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation."
14141,MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5AC-deficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load.
14142,"Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)."
14143,Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model.
14144,"Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity."
14145,Targeted treatment of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) remains problematic due to the complex pathogenesis of these disorders and difficulty in drug delivery.
14146,"The plant virus, cow pea mosaic virus (CPMV), has recently been explored as a nanoparticle delivery system for therapeutics targeting a number of diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration."
14147,"To understand the biodistribution of CPMV in the CNS, we examined CPMV uptake during infection of mice with neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)."
14148,CPMV localized mainly to the CNS endothelium in areas that contained an intact blood brain barrier.
14149,"However, in inflammatory lesions containing macrophage/microglial cell infiltration and IgG, CPMV could be detected in the brain parenchyma."
14150,"Furthermore, CPMV showed rapid internalization in an in vitro model of the BBB."
14151,These results suggest that CPMV particles could be used to a vehicle to deliver therapeutics to the damaged CNS during neurodegenerative and infectious diseases of the CNS.
14152,Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans.
14153,Are there ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in humans?
14154,"If so, then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods?"
14155,These were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans.
14156,"Virologists, ecologists and computational biologists from academia, federal government and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts, vectors and reservoirs."
14157,This workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability.
14158,Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps.
14159,"To answer the question of where to look, prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents, arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed."
14160,"Finally, opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps."
14161,"Taken together, these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps."
14162,Interferon (IFN) is an innate immune response protein that is involved in the antiviral response during viral infection.
14163,"Treatment of acute viral infections with exogenous interferon may be effective but is generally not feasible for clinical use due to many factors, including cost, stability, and availability."
14164,"To overcome these limitations, an adenovirus type 5-vectored consensus alpha IFN, termed DEF201, was constructed as a potential way to deliver sustained therapeutic levels of systemic IFN."
14165,"To demonstrate the efficacy of DEF201 against acute flaviviral disease, various concentrations of the construct were administered as a single intranasal dose prior to virus infection, which resulted in a dose-responsive, protective effect in a hamster model of yellow fever virus (YFV) disease."
14166,"A DEF201 dose of 5 × 10(7) PFU/animal administered intranasally just prior to YFV challenge protected 100% of the animals, while a 10-fold lower DEF201 dose exhibited lower, although significant, levels of protection."
14167,Virus titers in the liver and serum and levels of serum alanine aminotransferase were all significantly reduced as a result of DEF201 administration at all doses tested.
14168,"No toxicity, as indicated by weight loss or gross morbidity, was observed in non-YFV-infected animals treated with DEF201."
14169,"Protection of YFV-infected animals was observed when DEF201 was delivered as early as 7 days prior to virus challenge and as late as 2 days after virus challenge, demonstrating effective prophylaxis and therapy in a hamster model of disease."
14170,"Overall, it appears that DEF201 is effective in the treatment of YFV in a hamster model."
14171,"On September 20, 2012, a Saudi Arabian physician reported the isolation of a novel coronavirus from a patient with pneumonia on ProMED-mail."
14172,"Within a few days the same virus was detected in a Qatari patient receiving intensive care in a London hospital, a situation reminiscent of the role air travel played in the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002."
14173,SARS-CoV originated in China’s Guangdong Province and affected more than 8000 patients in 26 countries before it was contained six months later.
14174,"Over a year after the emergence of this novel coronavirus—Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—it has caused 178 laboratory confirmed cases and 76 deaths The emergence of a second highly pathogenic coronavirus within a decade highlights the importance of a coordinated global response incorporating reservoir surveillance, high-containment capacity with fundamental and applied research programs, and dependable communication pathways to ensure outbreak containment."
14175,"Here we review the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology, ecology, molecular biology, clinical features and intervention strategies of the novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV."

14180,Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed to be an immune-mediated disease in the central nervous system (CNS) that can be triggered by virus infections.
14181,"In Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, during the first week (acute stage), mice develop polioencephalomyelitis."
14182,"After 3 weeks (chronic stage), mice develop immune-mediated demyelination with virus persistence, which has been used as a viral model for MS. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) can suppress inflammation, and have been suggested to be protective in immune-mediated diseases, including MS."
14183,"However, in virus-induced inflammatory demyelination, although Tregs can suppress inflammation, preventing immune-mediated pathology, Tregs may also suppress anti-viral immune responses, leading to more active viral replication and/or persistence."
14184,"To determine the role and potential translational usage of Tregs in MS, we treated TMEV-infected mice with ex vivo-generated induced Tregs (iTregs) on day 0 (early) or during the chronic stage (therapeutic)."
14185,Early treatment worsened clinical signs during acute disease.
14186,The exacerbation of acute disease was associated with increased virus titers and decreased immune cell recruitment in the CNS.
14187,Therapeutic iTreg treatment reduced inflammatory demyelination during chronic disease.
14188,"Immunologically, iTreg treatment increased interleukin-10 production from B cells, CD4(+) T cells, and dendritic cells, which may contribute to the decreased CNS inflammation."
14189,Metagenomics was used to identify viral sequences in the plasma and CSF (cerobrospinal fluid) of 13 horses with unexplained neurological signs and in the plasma and respiratory swabs of 14 horses with unexplained respiratory signs.
14190,Equine hepacivirus and two copiparvoviruses (horse parvovirus-CSF and a novel parvovirus) were detected in plasma from neurological cases.
14191,Plasma from horses with respiratory signs contained the same two copiparvoviruses plus equine pegivirus D and respiratory swabs contained equine herpes virus 2 and 5.
14192,Based on genetic distances the novel copiparvovirus qualified as a member of a new parvovirus species we named Eqcopivirus.
14193,These samples plus another 41 plasma samples from healthy horses were tested by real-time PCRs for multiple equine parvoviruses and hepacivirus.
14194,"Over half the samples tested were positive for one to three viruses with eqcopivirus DNA detected in 20.5%, equine hepacivirus RNA and equine parvovirus-H DNA in 16% each, and horse parvovirus-CSF DNA in 12% of horses."
14195,Comparing viral prevalence in plasma none of the now three genetically characterized equine parvoviruses (all in the copiparvovirus genus) was significantly associated with neurological and respiratory signs in this limited sampling.
14196,Many emerging infections are RNA virus spillovers from animal reservoirs.
14197,"Reservoir identification is necessary for predicting the geographic extent of infection risk, but rarely are taxonomic levels below the animal species considered as reservoir, and only key circumstances in nature and methodology allow intrinsic virus-host associations to be distinguished from simple geographic (co-)isolation."
14198,We sampled and genetically characterized in detail a contact zone of two subtaxa of the rodent Mastomys natalensis in Tanzania.
14199,"We find two distinct arenaviruses, Gairo and Morogoro virus, each spatially confined to a single M. natalensis subtaxon, only co-occurring at the contact zone’s centre."
14200,"Inter-subtaxon hybridization at this centre and a continuum of quality habitat for M. natalensis show that both viruses have the ecological opportunity to spread into the other substaxon’s range, but do not, strongly suggesting host-intrinsic barriers."
14201,"Such barriers could explain why human cases of another M. natalensis-borne arenavirus, Lassa virus, are limited to West Africa."
14202,Background.
14203,"There is still no effective method to prevent or treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by SARS coronavirus (CoV)."
14204,"In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of a fully human monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro in a Rhesus macaque model of SARS."
14205,Methods.
14206,The antibody 5H10 was obtained by vaccination of KM mice bearing human immunoglobulin genes with Escherichiacoli–producing recombinant peptide containing the dominant epitope of the viral spike protein found in convalescent serum samples from patients with SARS.
14207,Results.
14208,"5H10, which recognized the same epitope that is also a cleavage site critical for the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells, inhibited propagation of the virus and pathological changes found in Rhesus macaques infected with the virus through the nasal route."
14209,"In addition, we analyzed the mode of action of 5H10, and the results suggested that 5H10 inhibited fusion between the virus envelope and host cell membrane."
14210,5H10 has potential for use in prevention and treatment of SARS if it reemerges.
14211,Conclusions.
14212,This study represents a platform to produce fully human antibodies against emerging infectious diseases in a timely and safe manner.
14213,Newly emerging viral pathogens pose a constant and unpredictable threat to human and animal health.
14214,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)."
14215,Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression.
14216,"However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans."
14217,The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis.
14218,We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).
14219,"To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood."
14220,"MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans."
14221,"The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach."
14222,"Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes."
14223,Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed.
14224,"Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model."
14225,"Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition."
14226,"Emerging viruses such as HIV, dengue, influenza A, SARS coronavirus, Ebola, and other viruses pose a significant threat to human health."
14227,Majority of these viruses are responsible for the outbreaks of pathogenic lethal infections.
14228,"To date, there are no effective therapeutic strategies available for the prophylaxis and treatment of these infections."
14229,Chloroquine analogs have been used for decades as the primary and most successful drugs against malaria.
14230,"Concomitant with the emergence of chloroquine‐resistant Plasmodium strains and a subsequent decrease in the use as antimalarial drugs, other applications of the analogs have been investigated."
14231,"Since the analogs have interesting biochemical properties, these drugs are found to be effective against a wide variety of viral infections."
14232,"As antiviral action, the analogs have been shown to inhibit acidification of endosome during the events of replication and infection."
14233,"Moreover, immunomodulatory effects of analogs have been beneficial to patients with severe inflammatory complications of several viral diseases."
14234,"Interestingly, one of the successful targeting strategies is the inhibition of HIV replication by the analogs in vitro which are being tested in several clinical trials."
14235,This review focuses on the potentialities of chloroquine analogs for the treatment of endosomal low pH dependent emerging viral diseases.
14236,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, caused by a zoonotically transmitted coronavirus (CoV)."
14237,"Over 1,900 cases have been reported to date, with ∼36% fatality rate."
14238,Lack of autopsies from MERS cases has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis.
14239,A small animal model that develops progressive pulmonary manifestations when infected with MERS-CoV would advance the field.
14240,"As mice are restricted to infection at the level of DPP4, the MERS-CoV receptor, we generated mice with humanized exons 10–12 of the mouse Dpp4 locus."
14241,"Upon inoculation with MERS-CoV, human DPP4 knockin (KI) mice supported virus replication in the lungs, but developed no illness."
14242,"After 30 serial passages through the lungs of KI mice, a mouse-adapted virus emerged (MERS(MA)) that grew in lungs to over 100 times higher titers than the starting virus."
14243,A plaque-purified MERS(MA) clone caused weight loss and fatal infection.
14244,"Virus antigen was observed in airway epithelia, pneumocytes, and macrophages."
14245,Pathologic findings included diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation associated with accumulation of activated inflammatory monocyte–macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs.
14246,"Relative to the parental MERS-CoV, MERS(MA) viruses contained 13–22 mutations, including several within the spike (S) glycoprotein gene."
14247,S-protein mutations sensitized viruses to entry-activating serine proteases and conferred more rapid entry kinetics.
14248,Recombinant MERS(MA) bearing mutant S proteins were more virulent than the parental virus in hDPP4 KI mice.
14249,The hDPP4 KI mouse and the MERS(MA) provide tools to investigate disease causes and develop new therapies.
14250,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea that is characterized by severe hemorrhage and a high fatality rate."
14251,"Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this disease."
14252,"To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection."
14253,"One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments."
14254,"Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV."
14255,"Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell."
14256,"Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains."
14257,"Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 SFTSV isolates previously reported."
14258,"Together, these data suggest that Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates."
14259,Wildlife has been considered the main source of novel viruses causing emerging infectious diseases.
14260,"Marmota himalayana is endemic to the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, China."
14261,"Here, based on a high-throughput method using Illumina RNA sequencing, we studied the RNA virome of M. himalayana and discovered multiple novel viruses, especially picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which have a bi-segmented genome and belong to the family Picobirnaviridae."
14262,"A total of 63% of the viral contigs corresponded to PBVs, comprising 274 segment 1 and 56 segment 2 sequences."
14263,"Unexpectedly, four unsegmented PBV genomes were also detected and confirmed by PCR and resequencing."
14264,"According to the phylogenetic analysis, the following nine PBV assortment types are proposed: C1:GI, C2:GIV, C4:GI, C4:GV, C5:GI, C7:GI, C8:GIV, C8:GV and C8:GII."
14265,"We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG."
14266,The model is supported by detection of the segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG not only in the 5′ untranslated regions of segment 1 (221 in 289) and segment 2 (57 in 80) of bi-segmented PBVs but also in the 5′ untranslated regions and junction sequences between the capsid and RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs.
14267,"Therefore, with RNA sequencing, we found an unexpected biodiversity of PBVs in M. himalayana, indicating that M. himalayana is a special host for PBVs."
14268,"We also proposed a putative model of how bi-segmented PBVs could be converted into unsegmented PBVs, which sheds new light on the processes of RNA virus genome evolution."
14269, Trichothecenes are exquisitely toxic to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and leukocytes and thus are likely to impair gut immunity.
14270,The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that the Type A trichothecene T-2 toxin interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to enteric reovirus infection.
14271,Mice were exposed i.p.
14272,"first to 1.75 mg/kg bw T-2 and then 2 h later with 3 × 107 plaque-forming units of reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L)."
14273,"As compared to vehicle-treated control, T-2-treated mice had dramatically elevated intestinal plaque-forming viral titers after 5 days and failed to completely clear the virus from intestine by 10 days."
14274,"Levels of reovirus λ2 core spike (L2 gene) RNA in feces in T-2-treated mice were significantly higher at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days than controls."
14275,T-2 potentiated L2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with as little as 50 μg/kg of the toxin having a potentiative effect.
14276,T-2 exposure transiently suppressed induction of reovirus-specific IgA in feces (6 and 8 days) as well as specific IgA and IgG2a in serum (5 days).
14277,This suppression corresponded to decreased secretion of reovirus-specific IgA and IgG2a in Peyer's patch (PP) and lamina propria fragment cultures prepared 5 days after infection.
14278,T-2 suppressed IFN-γ responses in PP to reovirus at 3 and 7 days as compared to infected controls whereas IL-2 mRNA concentrations were unaffected.
14279,"PP IL-6 mRNA levels were increased 2-fold 2 h after T-2 treatment, but no differences between infected T-2-exposed and infected vehicle-treated mice were detectable over the next 7 days."
14280,"Overall, the results suggest that T-2 toxin increased both the extent of GI tract reovirus infection and fecal shedding which corresponded to both suppressed immunoglobulin and IFN-γ responses."
14281,The use of growth promoting and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed has been a concerning subject over the last few decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans.
14282,"As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, spray dried plasma is considered one of the most promising."
14283,"However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America."
14284,"The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of spray dried plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of spray dried plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of spray dried animal plasma."
14285,Particular attention is given to studies in which spray dried plasma has been directly compared to antibiotics or other alternative antimicrobial products.
14286,"Several studies on the possible modes of action for spray dried plasma, such as preservation of gut barrier function or modulation of the immune response, are also reviewed."
14287,"Finally, the paper focuses on the review of the existing studies on the risks of disease transmission with the use of spray dried plasma from porcine origin."
14288,"Overall, spray dried plasma is a promising alternative to in-feed antimicrobials for piglets, particularly during the early stages of the post-weaning phase."
14289,"Additionally, there is enough evidence to support that commercial spray dried porcine plasma is a safe product for pigs."
14290," Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals, and can cause severe economic loss."
14291,Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins constitute a family of viral restriction factors that can inhibit the replication of several types of viruses.
14292,Our previous study showed that overexpression of swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) impeded replication of the FMD virus (FMDV) in BHK-21 cells and mice.
14293,"In this study, sIFITM3-transgenic (TG) pigs were produced by handmade cloning."
14294,Results showed that sIFITM3 was highly overexpressed in many organs of sIFITM3-TG pigs compared to wild-type pigs.
14295,"After a virulent FMDV strain (O/ES/2001) was intramuscularly inoculated, the sIFITM3-TG pigs showed slightly higher susceptibility to FMDV infection than wild-type pigs."
14296,Both groups displayed comparable degrees of clinical symptoms throughout the 14-day observation period.
14297,"Therefore, the induction of systemic sIFITM3 expression does not protect pigs against FMDV infection."
14298,"Based on these observations, we propose that a combination of interferons and vaccines be used to control FMDV infections and subsequent FMD outbreaks."
14299,"Throughout the world, populations of scavenger birds are declining rapidly with some populations already on the brink of extinction."
14300,"Much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues, lead, and other toxins."
14301,"Despite increased monitoring of these declining populations, little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species."
14302,"To assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species, we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in California: the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)."
14303,"California condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian paramyxovirus-2, West Nile virus (WNV) and Toxoplasma gondii."
14304,"Golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci and Toxoplasma gondii, and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, avian paramyxovirus-1, Toxoplasma gondii and WNV."
14305,Risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to WNV among free-flying condors.
14306,This study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered California condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats.
14307,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has repeatedly caused outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula.
14308,"To date, no approved medical countermeasures (MCM) are available to combat MERS-CoV infections."
14309,"Several neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including m336, a germline-like human mAb, have been chosen as promising MCM for MERS-CoV."
14310,"However, their clinical development has been hindered by the lack of a robust animal model that recapitulate the morbidity and mortality of human infections."
14311,We assessed the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of m336 by using well-characterized transgenic mice shown to be highly sensitive to MERS-CoV infection and disease.
14312,"We found that mice treated with m336 prior to or post lethal MERS-CoV challenging were fully protected, compared to control mice which sufferered from profound weight loss and uniform death within days after infection."
14313,"Taken together, these results support further development of m336 and other human monoclonal antibodies as potential therapeutics for MERS-CoV infection."
14314,Transgenic plants represent an inexpensive alternative to classical fermentation systems for production of recombinant subunit vaccines.
14315,"Transgenic potato plants were created that express the N-terminal domain of the glycoprotein S (N-gS) from Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), containing the major antigenic sites of the protein."
14316,"Extracts from potato tubers expressing N-gS were inoculated intraperitoneally to mice, and the vaccinated mice developed serum IgG specific for TGEV."
14317,"Furthermore, when potato tubers expressing N-gS were fed directly to mice, they developed serum antibodies specific for gS protein, demonstrating the oral immunogenicity of the plant derived spike protein from TGEV."
14318,Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) can be divided into low pathogenic and highly pathogenic coronaviruses.
14319,"The low pathogenic CoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness."
14320,"In contrast, highly pathogenic hCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia."
14321,"Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
14322,Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after hCoV infections.
14323,Here we review the current understanding of how a dysregulated immune response may cause lung immunopathology leading to deleterious clinical manifestations after pathogenic hCoV infections.
14324,": China is thought to be a hotspot for zoonotic influenza virus emergence, yet there have been few prospective studies examining the occupational risks of such infections."
14325,"METHODS: We present the first 2 years of data collected from a 5-year, prospective, cohort study of swine-exposed and -unexposed participants at 6 swine farms in China."
14326,We conducted serological and virological surveillance to examine evidence for swine influenza A virus infection in humans.
14327,"RESULTS: Of the 658 participants (521 swine-exposed and 137 swine-unexposed), 207 (31.5%) seroconverted against at least 1 swine influenza virus subtype (swine H1N1 or H3N2)."
14328,"Swine-exposed participants’ microneutralization titers, especially those enrolled at confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), were higher against the swine H1N1 virus than were other participants at 12 and 24 months."
14329,"Despite elevated titers, among the 187 study subjects for whom we had complete follow-up, participants working at swine CAFOs had significantly greater odds of seroconverting against both the swine H1N1 (odds ratio [OR] 19.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.55–358.65) and swine H3N2 (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.16–8.01) viruses, compared to unexposed and non-CAFO swine workers with less intense swine exposure."
14330,"CONCLUSIONS: While some of the observed increased risk against swine viruses may have been explained by exposure to human influenza strains, study data suggest that even with elevated preexisting antibodies, swine-exposed workers were at high risk of infection with enzootic swine influenza A viruses."
14331,Influenza virus remains a threat because of its ability to evade vaccine-induced immune responses due to antigenic drift.
14332,"Here, we describe the isolation, evolution, and structure of a broad-spectrum human monoclonal antibody (mAb), MEDI8852, effectively reacting with all influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes."
14333,MEDI8852 uses the heavy-chain VH6-1 gene and has higher potency and breadth when compared to other anti-stem antibodies.
14334,MEDI8852 is effective in mice and ferrets with a therapeutic window superior to that of oseltamivir.
14335,"Crystallographic analysis of Fab alone or in complex with H5 or H7 HA proteins reveals that MEDI8852 binds through a coordinated movement of CDRs to a highly conserved epitope encompassing a hydrophobic groove in the fusion domain and a large portion of the fusion peptide, distinguishing it from other structurally characterized cross-reactive antibodies."
14336,The unprecedented breadth and potency of neutralization by MEDI8852 support its development as immunotherapy for influenza virus-infected humans.
14337,"Since the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, there have been a number of clusters of human-to-human transmission."
14338,"These cases of human-to-human transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings, and they are suspected to result from repeated zoonotic introductions."
14339,"In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)."
14340,These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters.
14341,The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data.
14342,"Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently."
14343,"To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters."
14344,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions."
14345,These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.
14346,Background.
14347,Patients infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus present with acute lung injury (ALI) that is due to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammation.
14348,It is often fatal because there are few effective treatment options.
14349,"Complement activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of virus-induced lung injury; therefore, we investigated the effect of targeted complement inhibition on ALI induced by H7N9 virus infection."
14350,Methods.
14351,A novel neutralizing specific antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was used.
14352,This antibody blocked the ability of C5a to induce granulocytes to express CD11b while not affecting the ability of C5b to form the membrane attack complex.
14353,African green monkeys were inoculated with H7N9 virus and treated intravenously with IFX-1.
14354,Results.
14355,The virus infection led to intense ALI and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in association with excessive complement activation.
14356,Anti-C5a treatment in H7N9-infected monkeys substantially attenuated ALI: It markedly reduced the lung histopathological injury and decreased the lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils.
14357,"Moreover, the treatment decreased the intensity of SIRS; the body temperature changes were minimal and the plasma levels of inflammatory mediators were markedly reduced."
14358,The treatments also significantly decreased the virus titers in the infected lungs.
14359,Conclusions.
14360,Antihuman C5a antibody treatment remarkably reduced the ALI and systemic inflammation induced by H7N9 virus infection.
14361,Complement inhibition may be a promising adjunctive therapy for severe viral pneumonia.
14362,"Viral diseases affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and the few available drugs to treat these diseases often come with limitations."
14363,The key obstacle to the development of new antiviral agents is their delivery into infected cells in vivo.
14364,Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptides that can cross the cellular lipid bilayer with the remarkable capability to shuttle conjugated cargoes into cells.
14365,"CPPs have been successfully utilized to enhance the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of antiviral molecules, and thereby increase the inhibitory activity of potential antiviral proteins and oligonucleotide analogues, both in cultured cells and in animal models."
14366,"This review will address the notable findings of these studies, highlighting some promising results and discussing the challenges CPP technology has to overcome for further clinical applications."
14367,"Despite high sequence similarity between pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses, there is extreme variation in host pathogenicity from one viral strain to the next."
14368,Identifying the underlying mechanisms of variability in pathogenicity is a critical task for understanding influenza virus infection and effective management of highly pathogenic influenza virus disease.
14369,We applied a network-based modeling approach to identify critical functions related to influenza virus pathogenicity using large transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from mice infected with six influenza virus strains or mutants.
14370,Our analysis revealed two pathogenicity-related gene expression clusters; these results were corroborated by matching proteomics data.
14371,We also identified parallel downstream processes that were altered during influenza pathogenesis.
14372,"We found that network bottlenecks (nodes that bridge different network regions) were highly enriched in pathogenicity-related genes, while network hubs (highly connected network nodes) were significantly depleted in these genes."
14373,We confirmed that this trend persisted in a distinct virus: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS).
14374,"The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in influenza pathogenesis, one of the bottleneck regulators with corroborating signals across transcript and protein expression data, was tested and validated in additional mouse infection experiments."
14375,"We demonstrate that EGFR is important during influenza infection, but the role it plays changes for lethal versus non-lethal infections."
14376,"Our results show that by using association networks, bottleneck genes that lack hub characteristics can be used to predict a gene’s involvement in influenza virus pathogenicity."
14377,We also demonstrate the utility of employing multiple network approaches for analyzing host response data from viral infections.
14378,Feline models of viral pathogenesis: Opportunity knocks
14379,"One of the most frequent statements, provided in different variations in the introduction of experimental studies on multiple sclerosis (MS), is that “Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a suitable model to study its pathogenesis”."
14380,"However, so far, no single experimental model covers the entire spectrum of the clinical, pathological, or immunological features of the disease."
14381,"Many different models are available, which proved to be highly useful for studying different aspects of inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system."
14382,"However, the relevance of results from such models for MS pathogenesis has to be critically validated."
14383,"Current EAE models are mainly based on inflammation, induced by auto-reactive CD4(+) T-cells, and these models reflect important aspects of MS."
14384,"However, pathological data and results from clinical trials in MS indicate that CD8(+) T-cells and B-lymphocytes may play an important role in propagating inflammation and tissue damage in established MS."
14385,"Viral models may reflect key features of MS-like inflammatory demyelination, but are difficult to use due to their very complex pathogenesis, involving direct virus-induced and immune-mediated mechanisms."
14386,"Furthermore, evidence for a role of viruses in MS pathogenesis is indirect and limited, and an MS-specific virus infection has not been identified so far."
14387,"Toxic models are highly useful to unravel mechanisms of de- and remyelination, but do not reflect other important aspects of MS pathology and pathogenesis."
14388,"For all these reasons, it is important to select the right experimental model to answer specific questions in MS research."
14389,African swine fever virus is transmissible through animal consumption of contaminated feed.
14390,"To determine virus survival during transoceanic shipping, we calculated the half-life of the virus in 9 feed ingredients exposed to 30-day shipment conditions."
14391,"Half-lives ranged from 9.6 to 14.2 days, indicating that the feed matrix environment promotes virus stability."
14392,Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide.
14393,"Although the host multitropism of some pathogens has rendered their manipulation possible in animal models, the human-restricted tropism of numerous viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites has seriously hampered our understanding of these pathogens."
14394,"Hence, uncovering the genetic basis underlying the narrow tropism of such pathogens is critical for understanding their mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis."
14395,"Moreover, such genetic dissection is essential for the generation of permissive animal models that can serve as critical tools for the development of therapeutics or vaccines against challenging human pathogens."
14396,"In this review, we describe different experimental approaches utilized to uncover the genetic foundation regulating pathogen host tropism as well as their relevance for studying the tropism of several important human pathogens."
14397,"Finally, we discuss the current and future uses of this knowledge for generating genetically modified animal models permissive for these pathogens."
14398,: More knowledge about viral populations in wild animals is needed in order to better understand and assess the risk of zoonotic diseases.
14399,"In this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores: a badger (Meles meles), a mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) and an otter (Lutra lutra) from Portugal."
14400,"RESULTS: We detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed, such as five gemycircularviruses."
14401,Four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger.
14402,In addition we also identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the Nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter.
14403,CONCLUSIONS: Together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease.
14404,"Our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut, although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution."
14405,"A rodent or other small animal model for HIV-1 has not been forthcoming, with the principal obstacles being species-specific restriction mechanisms and deficits in HIV-1 dependency factors."
14406,Some Carnivorans may harbor comparatively fewer impediments.
14407,"For example, in contrast to mice, the domestic cat genome encodes essential nonreceptor HIV-1 dependency factors."
14408,All Feliformia species and at least one Caniformia species also lack a major lentiviral restriction mechanism (TRIM5α/TRIMCyp proteins).
14409,"Here we investigated cells from two species in another carnivore family, the Mustelidae, for permissiveness to the HIV-1 life cycle."
14410,"Mustela putorius furo (domesticated ferret) primary cells and cell lines did not restrict HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), or N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) postentry and supported late HIV-1 life cycle steps comparably to human cells."
14411,"The ferret TRIM5α gene exon 8, which encodes the B30.2 domain, was found to be pseudogenized."
14412,"Strikingly, ferret (but not mink) cells engineered to express human HIV-1 entry receptors supported productive spreading replication, amplification, and serial passage of wild-type HIV-1."
14413,"Nevertheless, produced virions had relatively reduced infectivity and the virus accrued G→A hypermutations, consistent with APOBEC3 protein pressure."
14414,Ferret cell-passaged HIV-1 also evolved amino acid changes in the capsid cyclophilin A binding loop.
14415,We conclude that the genome of this carnivore can provide essential nonreceptor HIV-1 dependency factors and that ferret APOBEC3 proteins with activity against HIV-1 are likely.
14416,"Even so, unlike in cat cells, HIV-1 can replicate in ferret cells without vif substitution."
14417,The virus evolves in this novel nonprimate cell adaptive landscape.
14418,"We suggest that further characterization of HIV-1 adaptation in ferret cells and delineation of Mustelidae restriction factor repertoires are warranted, with a view to the potential for an HIV-1 animal model."
14419,"With rapidly increasing animal pathogen surveillance requirements, new technologies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of pathogens in the occurrence and development of animal diseases."
14420,We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China.
14421,Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method.
14422,"The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms."
14423,The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses.
14424,Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis.
14425,One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis.
14426,"Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes."
14427,"The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses."
14428, Positive-strand RNA viruses exist as a quasi-species due to the incorporation of mutations into the viral genome during replication by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).
14429,"Therefore, the RdRP is often described as a low-fidelity enzyme."
14430,"However, until recently, a complete description of the kinetic, thermodynamic and structural basis for the nucleotide incorporation fidelity of the RdRP has not been available."
14431,"In this article, we review the following: (i) the steps employed by the RdRP to incorporate a correct nucleotide; (ii) the steps that are employed by the RdRP for nucleotide selection; (iii) the structure-based hypothesis for nucleotide selection; (iv) the impact of sites remote from the active site on polymerase fidelity."
14432,"Given the recent observation that RNA viruses exist on the threshold of error catastrophe, the studies reviewed herein suggest novel strategies to perturb RdRP fidelity that may lead ultimately to the development of antiviral agents to treat RNA virus infection."
14433,Henipavirus infection causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans that can be fatal.
14434,"To characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection in vivo, we performed experimental infections in ferrets followed by genome-wide gene expression analysis of lung and brain tissues."
14435,"The Hendra, Nipah-Bangladesh, and Nipah-Malaysia strains caused severe respiratory and neurological disease with animals succumbing around 7 days post infection."
14436,"Despite the presence of abundant viral shedding, animal-to-animal transmission did not occur."
14437,The host gene expression profiles of the lung tissue showed early activation of interferon responses and subsequent expression of inflammation-related genes that coincided with the clinical deterioration.
14438,"Additionally, the lung tissue showed unchanged levels of lymphocyte markers and progressive downregulation of cell cycle genes and extracellular matrix components."
14439,"Infection in the brain resulted in a limited breadth of the host responses, which is in accordance with the immunoprivileged status of this organ."
14440,"Finally, we propose a model of the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection that integrates multiple components of the host responses."
14441,: Live poultry markets (LPMs) pose a threat to public health by promoting the amplification and dissemination of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and by providing the ideal setting for zoonotic influenza transmission.
14442,OBJECTIVE: This review assessed the impact of different interventions implemented in LPMs to control the emergence of zoonotic influenza.
14443,"METHODS: Publications were identified through a systematic literature search in the PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases."
14444,"Eligible studies assessed the impact of different interventions, such as temporary market closure or a ban on holding poultry overnight, in reducing i) AIV-detection rates in birds and the market environment or ii) influenza incidence in humans."
14445,"Unpublished literature, reviews, editorials, cross-sectional studies, theoretical models and publications in languages other than English were excluded."
14446,Relevant findings were extracted and critically evaluated.
14447,"For the comparative analysis of findings across studies, standardized outcome measures were computed as i) the relative risk reduction (RRR) of AIV-detection in LPMs and ii) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of H7N9-incidence in humans."
14448,RESULTS: A total of 16 publications were identified and reviewed.
14449,"Collectively, the data suggest that AIV-circulation can be significantly reduced in the LPM-environment and among market-birds through (i) temporary LPM closure, (ii) periodic rest days (iii) market depopulation overnight and (iv) improved hygiene and disinfection."
14450,"Overall, the findings indicate that the length of stay of poultry in the market is a critical control point to interrupt the AIV-replication cycle within LPMs."
14451,"In addition, temporary LPM closure was associated with a significant reduction of the incidence of zoonotic influenza."
14452,The interpretation of these findings is limited by variations in the implementation of interventions.
14453,"In addition, some of the included studies were of ecologic nature or lacked an inferential framework, which might have lead to cosiderable confounding and bias."
14454,"CONCLUSIONS: The evidence collected in this review endorses permanent LPM-closure as a long-term objective to reduce the zoonotic risk of avian influenza, although its economic and socio-political implications favour less drastic interventions, e.g."
14455,"weekly rest days, for implementation in the short-term."
14456,"In 2010, new Chinese strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), clinically more severe than the classical strains, emerged."
14457,"These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China with further spreading across the world, evidencing the emergent nature of these strains."
14458,"In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database."
14459,Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV.
14460,"The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States."
14461,"The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US."
14462,The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US.
14463,"Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the main way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador."
14464,Interactions Between Sars Coronavirus and its Receptor
14465, This review details the molecular virology of the hepatitis E virus (HEV).
14466,"While replicons and in vitro infection systems have recently become available, a lot of information on HEV has been generated through comparisons with better-studied positive-strand RNA viruses and through subgenomic expression of viral open reading frames."
14467,These models are now being verified with replicon and infection systems.
14468,"We provide here the current knowledge on the HEV genome and its constituent proteins – ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3."
14469,"Based on the available information, we also modify the existing model of the HEV life cycle."
14470, Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe lower respiratory tract infection in people.
14471,Previous studies suggested dromedary camels were a reservoir for this virus.
14472,"We tested for the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar linked to two human cases of the infection in October, 2013."
14473,"Methods We took nose swabs, rectal swabs, and blood samples from all camels on the Qatari farm."
14474,"We tested swabs with RT-PCR, with amplification targeting the E gene (upE), nucleocapsid (N) gene, and open reading frame (ORF) 1a."
14475,PCR positive samples were tested by different MERS-CoV specific PCRs and obtained sequences were used for phylogentic analysis together with sequences from the linked human cases and other human cases.
14476,"We tested serum samples from the camels for IgG immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, and virus neutralisation assay."
14477,"Findings We obtained samples from 14 camels on Oct 17, 2013."
14478,We detected MERS-CoV in nose swabs from three camels by three independent RT-PCRs and sequencing.
14479,The nucleotide sequence of an ORF1a fragment (940 nucleotides) and a 4·2 kb concatenated fragment were very similar to the MERS-CoV from two human cases on the same farm and a MERS-CoV isolate from Hafr-Al-Batin.
14480,"Eight additional camel nose swabs were positive on one or more RT-PCRs, but could not be confirmed by sequencing."
14481,All camels had MERS-CoV spike-binding antibodies that correlated well with the presence of neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV.
14482,Interpretation Our study provides virological confirmation of MERS-CoV in camels and suggests a recent outbreak affecting both human beings and camels.
14483,"We cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa, or if a third source was responsible."
14484,"Funding European Union projects EMPERIE (contract number 223498), ANTIGONE (contract number 278976), and the VIRGO consortium."
14485,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower-respiratory tract disease in calves and young children, yet no human vaccine nor efficient curative treatments are available."
14486,Here we describe a recombinant human RSV reverse genetics system in which the red fluorescent protein (mCherry) or the firefly luciferase (Luc) genes are inserted into the RSV genome.
14487,"Expression of mCherry and Luc are correlated with infection rate, allowing the monitoring of RSV multiplication in cell culture."
14488,"Replication of the Luc-encoding virus in living mice can be visualized by bioluminescent imaging, bioluminescence being detected in the snout and lungs of infected mice after nasal inoculation."
14489,"We propose that these recombinant viruses are convenient and valuable tools for screening of compounds active against RSV, and can be used as an extremely sensitive readout for studying effects of antiviral therapeutics in living mice."
14490,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/ncomms6104) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
14491,Enveloped viruses have evolved membrane glycoproteins (GPs) that mediate entry into host cells.
14492,These proteins are important targets for antiviral therapies and vaccines.
14493,"Several efforts to understand and combat infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have therefore focused on the viral GP, known as spike (S)."
14494,"In a short period of time, important aspects of SARS-CoV S-protein function were unraveled."
14495,"The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV provided an insight into viral tropism and pathogenesis, whereas mapping of functional domains in the S-protein enabled inhibitors to be generated."
14496,Vaccines designed on the basis of SARS-CoV S-protein were shown to be effective in animals and consequently are attractive candidates for vaccine trials in humans.
14497,"Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV S facilitates viral entry into target cells and illustrate current approaches that are used to inhibit this process."
14498,: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged as a human disease in 2002 and detailed phylogenetic analysis and epidemiological studies have suggested that the SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated from animals.
14499,The Spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains at least three regions that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the S1 and S2 domains.
14500,We previously characterized a panel of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) but the majority of epitopes recognized by the MAbs remained unknown.
14501,METHODS: In this study we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as in vitro and in vivo fitness.
14502,RESULTS: Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles.
14503,We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein.
14504,"Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection."
14505,"CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a mechanism to overcome neutralization escape by using broadly cross reactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor binding domain, critical for virus replication and virulence."
14506,Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen with a high impact on human health.
14507,It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response.
14508,"To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response."
14509,DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity.
14510,We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs).
14511,In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex.
14512,We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor.
14513,"Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication."
14514,"Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV."
14515,"Additionally, we show that DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice."
14516, Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox) during acute infection.
14517,Several studies have shown that T cells are early and preferential targets of VZV infection that play a critical role in disseminating VZV in to the skin and ganglia.
14518,"However, the transcriptional changes that occur in VZV-infected T cells remain unclear due to limited access to clinical samples and robust translational animal models."
14519,"In this study, we used a nonhuman primate model of VZV infection where rhesus macaques are infected with the closely related Simian Varicella Virus (SVV) to provide novel insights into VZV-T cell interactions."
14520,"RNA sequencing of bronchial alveolar lavage-resident T cells isolated from infected rhesus macaques show that SVV infection alters expression of genes important for regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, metabolism, and antiviral immunity."
14521,"These data provide insight into cellular processes that may support viral replication, facilitate SVV dissemination, and evade host defense."
14522,": Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has a significant impact on public health throughout Asia, and there is a pressing need for development of new therapeutics against it."
14523,METHODS: Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) are antisense agents that enter cells readily and interfere with gene expression.
14524,"Four PPMOs, targeting various locations in the JEV genome, were evaluated for antiviral activity against JEV in cultured cells and the mouse model of JEV infection."
14525,"RESULTS: A PPMO (P10882) targeting the JEV 3′ cyclization sequence (3′CSI) had significant antiviral activity in Vero (epithelial), Neuro2A (neuronal) and J774E (macrophage) cells at concentrations that were not cytotoxic."
14526,"P10882 added before infection suppressed JEV replication to an undetectable level in Vero cells and produced a 93% and 66% reduction in titre in J774E and Neuro2A cells, respectively, when measured at 24 h post-infection."
14527,"In uninfected cells, fluorescein-labelled PPMOs entered J774E cells most efficiently, followed by Vero and Neuro2A cells."
14528,"The antiviral effect of P10882 was also demonstrated in vivo, where 60%–80% of 1-week-old mice treated intracerebrally with a 20 mg/kg dose of P10882 every 12 h for 5 days were protected from a lethal dose of JEV and showed an undetectable level of virus in brain tissue at 2 days post-infection."
14529,"CONCLUSIONS: P10882, which targets sequence that is highly conserved across members of the JEV serocomplex, was previously shown to be effective in a mouse model of West Nile disease, and represents a candidate antiviral agent against members of the JEV serocomplex."
14530,"New and emerging infectious diseases affect humans, domestic animals, livestock and wildlife and can have a significant impact on health, trade and biodiversity."
14531,"Of the emerging infectious diseases of humans, 75% are zoonotic, with wildlife being an increasingly important source of inter-species transmission."
14532,Recent animal health emergencies have highlighted the vulnerability of the livestock sector to the impact of infectious diseases and the associated risks to human health.
14533,Outbreaks resulting from wildlife trade have resulted in enormous economic losses globally.
14534,"On a global level, the human health sector lags behind the animal health sector in the assessment of potential threats, although substantive differences exist among countries in the state of national preparedness planning for emerging diseases."
14535,"The aim of this study was to demonstrate how latent epidemics can potentially evolve into a pandemic instantaneously due to globally mobile human population in recent times, as can be seen in the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa."
14536,Selected cases of current epidemics are used in this study to identify emergent patterns.
14537,These cases exemplify the need for a comprehensive analysis of infectious diseases and serve as an initial stage when developing appropriate strategies in improving epidemic management.
14538,This study can help better understand the complexities of infectious diseases and assist in developing a specific set of preventative processes from the individual to international levels when developing strategies to reducing the effects of an epidemic outbreak.
14539,The US swine industry has been impaired over the last 25 years by the far-reaching financial losses caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS).
14540,"Here, we explored the relations between the spatial risk of PRRS outbreaks and its phylodynamic history in the U.S during 1998–2016 using ORF5 sequences collected from swine farms in the Midwest region."
14541,"We used maximum entropy and Bayesian phylodynamic models to generate risk maps for PRRS outbreaks and reconstructed the evolutionary history of three selected phylogenetic clades (A, B and C)."
14542,"High-risk areas for PRRS were best-predicted by pig density and climate seasonality and included Minnesota, Iowa and South Dakota."
14543,Phylodynamic models demonstrated that the geographical spread of the three clades followed a heterogeneous spatial diffusion process.
14544,"Furthermore, PRRS viruses were characterized by typical seasonality in their population size."
14545,"However, endemic strains were characterized by a substantially slower population growth and evolutionary rates, as well as smaller spatial dispersal rates when compared to emerging strains."
14546,We demonstrated the prospects of combining inferences derived from two unique analytical methods to inform decisions related to risk-based interventions of an important pathogen affecting one of the largest food animal industries in the world.
14547,The human bocavirus is one of the most common respiratory viruses and occurs in all age groups.
14548,"Because Koch’s postulates have been fulfilled unintendedly, it is currently accepted that the virus is a real pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections causing clinical symptoms ranging from a mild common cold to life-threatening respiratory diseases."
14549,"In order to exclude a viremia, serological analysis should be included during laboratory diagnostics, as acute and chronic infections cannot be differentiated by detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory specimen alone due to prolonged viral shedding."
14550,"Besides its ability to persist, the virus appears to trigger chronic lung disease and increases clinical symptoms by causing fibrotic lung diseases."
14551,"Due to the lack of an animal model, clinical trials remain the major method for studying the long-term effects of HBoV infections."
14552,": The Egyptian Rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a common fruit bat species found throughout Africa and the Middle East, was recently identified as a natural reservoir host of Marburg virus."
14553,"With Ebola virus, Marburg virus is a member of the family Filoviridae that causes severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and nonhuman primates, but results in little to no pathological consequences in bats."
14554,Understanding host-pathogen interactions within reservoir host species and how it differs from hosts that experience severe disease is an important aspect of evaluating viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics and methods of prevention.
14555,RESULTS: Progress in studying bat reservoir host responses to virus infection is hampered by the lack of host-specific reagents required for immunological studies.
14556,"In order to establish a basis for the design of reagents, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome."
14557,We performed de novo transcriptome assembly using deep RNA sequencing data from 11 distinct tissues from one male and one female bat.
14558,We observed high similarity between this transcriptome and those available from other bat species.
14559,"Gene expression analysis demonstrated clustering of expression profiles by tissue, where we also identified enrichment of tissue-specific gene ontology terms."
14560,"In addition, we identified and experimentally validated the expression of novel coding transcripts that may be specific to this species."
14561,CONCLUSION: We comprehensively characterized the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome de novo.
14562,"This transcriptome will be an important resource for understanding bat immunology, physiology, disease pathogenesis, and virus transmission."
14563,"ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2124-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
14564,BackgroundViral encephalitis is a dangerous compromise between the need to robustly clear pathogen from the brain and the need to protect neurons from bystander injury.
14565,Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of C57Bl/6 mice is a model of viral encephalitis in which the compromise results in hippocampal damage and permanent neurological sequelae.
14566,"We previously identified brain infiltrating inflammatory monocytes as the primary driver of this hippocampal pathology, but the mechanisms involved in recruiting these cells to the brain were unclear.MethodsChemokine expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by microarray, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence."
14567,Monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection was measured by flow cytometry.
14568,"CCL2 levels were manipulated by immunodepletion and by specific removal from neurons in mice generated by crossing a line expressing the Cre recombinase behind the synapsin promoter to animals with floxed CCL2.ResultsInoculation of the brain with TMEV induced hippocampal production of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 that peaked at 6 hours postinfection, whereas inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV did not elicit this response."
14569,Immunofluorescence revealed that hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of CCL2 at this timepoint.
14570,Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 abrogated or blunted the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during acute infection.
14571,"Specific genetic deletion of CCL2 from neurons reduced serum and hippocampal CCL2 levels and inhibited inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain.ConclusionsWe conclude that intracranial inoculation with infectious TMEV rapidly induces the expression of CCL2 in neurons, and this cellular source is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis."
14572,These findings highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system.
14573,": In order to identify priorities for building integrated surveillance systems that effectively model and predict human risk of zoonotic diseases, there is a need for improved understanding of the practical options for linking surveillance data of animals and humans."
14574,We conducted an analysis of the literature and characterized the linkage between animal and human health data.
14575,We discuss the findings in relation to zoonotic surveillance and the linkage of human and animal data.
14576,"METHODS: The Canary Database, an online bibliographic database of animal-sentinel studies was searched and articles were classified according to four linkage categories."
14577,"RESULTS: 465 studies were identified and assigned to linkage categories involving: descriptive, analytic, molecular, or no human outcomes of human and animal health."
14578,"Descriptive linkage was the most common, whereby both animal and human health outcomes were presented, but without quantitative linkage between the two."
14579,"Rarely, analytic linkage was utilized in which animal data was used to quantitatively predict human risk."
14580,"The other two categories included molecular linkage, and no human outcomes, which present health outcomes in animals but not humans."
14581,DISCUSSION: We found limited use of animal data to quantitatively predict human risk and listed the methods from the literature that performed analytic linkage.
14582,"The lack of analytic linkage in the literature might not be solely related to technological barriers including access to electronic database, statistical software packages, and Geographical Information System (GIS)."
14583,"Rather, the problem might be from a lack of understanding by researchers of the importance of animal data as a 'sentinel' for human health."
14584,Researchers performing zoonotic surveillance should be aware of the value of animal-sentinel approaches for predicting human risk and consider analytic methods for linking animal and human data.
14585,Qualitative work needs to be done in order to examine researchers' decisions in linkage strategies between animal and human data.
14586, A mutation of just one gene will cause abnormal cell behavior leading to the synthesis of a dysfunctional protein.
14587,This mutation will inevitably result in the cell functioning only marginally or not at all.
14588,"Other genetic mutations interfere with the cell’s normal life cycle, especially the cell-division cycle."
14589,The goal behind recombinant DNA technology is to deliver the correct version of a mutated gene to the cell so that the expression will lead to the normal production of protein and the restoration of normal cell function.
14590,This can be considered qualitatively different from other conventional treatments due to genetic material being a putative therapeutic agent.
14591,"By altering the genetic material of cells, gene therapy may correct, or one day cure, the specific disease pathophysiology."
14592,"Genetic engineering has been used in veterinary medicine to diagnose, prevent and treat diseases, breed different species and produce transgenic animals for therapeutic proteins or xenografting."
14593,"In this review the current status of recombinant DNA technology and its application in veterinary medicine together with the obstacles to, and applications of, genetic engineering in veterinary medicine are discussed."
14594,The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 brought back memories of the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002.
14595,More than 1500 MERS-CoV cases were recorded in 42 months with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 40%.
14596,"Meanwhile, 8000 cases of SARS-CoV were confirmed in six months with a CFR of 10%."
14597,The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV ranges from mild and non-specific presentation to progressive and severe pneumonia.
14598,No predictive signs or symptoms exist to differentiate MERS-CoV from community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
14599,An apparent heterogeneity was observed in transmission.
14600,Most MERS-CoV cases were secondary to large outbreaks in healthcare settings.
14601,"These cases were secondary to community-acquired cases, which may also cause family outbreaks."
14602,Travel-associated MERS infection remains low.
14603,"However, the virus exhibited a clear tendency to cause large outbreaks outside the Arabian Peninsula as exemplified by the outbreak in the Republic of Korea."
14604,"In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about MERS-CoV and highlight travel-related issues."
14605, Excessive host inflammatory responses negatively impact disease outcomes in respiratory infection.
14606,"Host-pathogen interactions during the infective phase of influenza are well studied, but little is known about the host’s response during the repair stage."
14607,"Here, we show that influenza infection stimulated the expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) via a direct IL6-STAT3-mediated mechanism."
14608,ANGPTL4 enhanced pulmonary tissue leakiness and exacerbated inflammation-induced lung damage.
14609,Treatment of infected mice with neutralizing anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies significantly accelerated lung recovery and improved lung tissue integrity.
14610,ANGPTL4-deficient mice also showed reduced lung damage and recovered faster from influenza infection when compared to their wild-type counterparts.
14611,Retrospective examination of human lung biopsy specimens from infection-induced pneumonia with tissue damage showed elevated expression of ANGPTL4 when compared to normal lung samples.
14612,These observations underscore the important role that ANGPTL4 plays in lung infection and damage and may facilitate future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of influenza pneumonia.
14613,"Despite years of research, the precise determinants of coronavirus replication and pathogenesis remain unidentified."
14614,"What is known of the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is limited, but clinical observations suggest that both viral-induced cytotoxicity and host immune-mediated destruction contribute to the severity of disease."
14615,This summary discusses recent advances in coronavirus research that will facilitate the identification of crucial molecular targets for the rational design of SARS therapeutics.
14616,"Section Editor: Anne Moscona – Department of Pediatrics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L. Levy Place, Box 1198, New York, NY 10029, USA When the SARS coronavirus came dramatically to attention as a fatal and potentially pandemic respiratory disease, the scientific response was swift and effective."
14617,"The etiological agent was identified, the genome was cloned and sequenced, and large strides have been made in understanding key points in the viral life cycle, including recent identification of a functional host cell receptor and solution of the three-dimensional structure of the viral attachment protein."
14618,Much of this progress was possible only because a foundation of basic coronavirus biology existed.
14619,The Denison laboratory has been at the forefront of the small group of investigators who have dissected the basic features of coronaviruses.
14620,Denison has discovered critical mechanisms in the life cycle of the coronaviruses and is a key figure in the effective and urgent application of this knowledge to SARS.
14621, SARS coronavirus continues to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China.
14622,No active or passive immunoprophylaxis for disease induced by SARS coronavirus is available.
14623,"We investigated prophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a neutralising human monoclonal antibody in ferrets, which can be readily infected with the virus."
14624,"Prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody at 10 mg/kg reduced replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets by 3·3 logs (95% Cl 2·6–4·0 logs; p<0·001), completely prevented the development of SARS coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology (p=0·013), and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions."
14625,The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection.
14626,"Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity."
14627,"However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically."
14628,"In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability."
14629,This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations.
14630,"Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed."
14631,"We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D(G64S), has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D(G64S) populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments."
14632,Experimental evolution of 3D(G64S) under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype.
14633,"Mice infected with 3D(G64S) exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply."
14634,"Furthermore, compensation of the 3D(G64S) growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not."
14635,Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy.
14636,"In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity."
14637,"Against a backdrop of seasonal influenza virus epidemics, emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) occasionally jump from birds to humans, posing a public health risk, especially with the recent sharp increase in H7N9 infections."
14638,Evaluations of cross-reactive T-cell immunity to seasonal influenza viruses and human-infecting AIVs have been reported previously.
14639,"However, the roles of influenza A virus-derived epitopes in the cross-reactive T-cell responses and heterosubtypic protections are not well understood; understanding those roles is important for preventing and controlling new emerging AIVs."
14640,"Here, among the members of a healthy population presumed to have previously been infected by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), we found that pH1N1-specific T cells showed cross- but biased reactivity to human-infecting AIVs, i.e., H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, and H9N2, which correlates with distinct protections."
14641,"Through a T-cell epitope-based phylogenetic analysis, the cellular immunogenic clustering expanded the relevant conclusions to a broader range of virus strains."
14642,We defined the potential key conserved epitopes required for cross-protection and revealed the molecular basis for the immunogenic variations.
14643,Our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to AIVs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development.
14644,SARS: The First Pandemic of the 21(st) Century
14645,"Intranasal administration of synthetic siRNA is an effective modality of RNAi delivery for the prevention and therapy of respiratory diseases, including pulmonary infections."
14646,"Vehicles used for nasal siRNA delivery include established as well as novel reagents, many of which have been recently optimized."
14647,"In general, they all promote significant uptake of siRNA into the lower respiratory tract, including the lung."
14648,"When properly designed and optimized, these siRNAs offer significant protection against respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)."
14649,"Nasally administered siRNA remains within the lung and does not access systemic blood flow, as judged by its absence in other major organs such as liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle."
14650,"Adverse immune reaction is generally not encountered, especially when immunogenic and/or off-target siRNA sequences and toxic vehicles are avoided."
14651,"In fact, siRNA against RSV has entered Phase II clinical trials in human with promising results."
14652,"Here, we provide a standardized procedure for using the nose as a specific route for siRNA delivery into the lung of laboratory animals."
14653,It should be clear that this simple and efficient system has enormous potential for therapeutics.
14654,"Passive serotherapy can confer immediate protection against microbial infection, but methods to rapidly generate human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are not yet available."
14655,We have developed an improved method for Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B cells.
14656,"We used this method to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to isolate monoclonal antibodies specific for different viral proteins, including 35 antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity ranging from 10(−8)M to 10(−11)M. One such antibody confers protection in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection."
14657,These results show that it is possible to interrogate the memory repertoire of immune donors to rapidly and efficiently isolate neutralizing antibodies that have been selected in the course of natural infection.
14658,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nm1080) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
14659, The intrathecal humoral immune response was analysed in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and Lewis rats with subacute measles virus (MV)-induced encephalomyelitis (SAME).
14660,"SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity."
14661,SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients.
14662,"Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunoglobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens."
14663,Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients.
14664,These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.
14665,Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ad) are promising tools for cancer therapeutics.
14666,"Most Ad-based therapies utilize species C serotypes, with Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) most commonly employed."
14667,"Prior clinical trials demonstrated low efficiency of oncolytic Ad5 vectors, mainly due to the absence of Ad5 primary receptor (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor, CAR) on cancer cells."
14668,Engineering serotype chimeric vectors (Ad5/3) to utilize Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors has greatly improved their oncolytic potential.
14669,Clinical translation of these infectivity-enhanced vectors has been challenging due to a lack of replication permissive animal models.
14670,"In this study, we explored pigs as a model to study the performance of fiber-modified Ad5/3 chimeric vectors."
14671,"As a control, the Ad5 fiber-unmodified virus was used."
14672,"We analyzed binding, gene transfer, replication, and cytolytic ability of Ad5 and Ad5/3 in various non-human cell lines (murine, hamster, canine, porcine)."
14673,Among all tested cell lines only porcine cells supported active binding and replication of Ad5/3.
14674,Syrian hamster cells supported Ad5 replication but showed no evidence of productive viral replication after infection with Ad5/3 vectors.
14675,"Transduction and replication ability of Ad5/3 in porcine cells outperformed Ad5, a phenomenon often observed in human cancer cell lines."
14676,Replication of Ad5 and Ad5/3 was subsequently evaluated in vivo in immunocompetent pigs.
14677,Quantitative PCR analyses 7 days post infection revealed Ad5 and Ad5/3 DNA and replication-dependent luciferase activity in the swine lungs and spleen indicating active replication in these tissues.
14678,These studies demonstrated the flaws in using Syrian hamsters for testing serotype chimeric Ad5/3 vectors.
14679,This is the first report to validate the pig as a valuable model for preclinical testing of oncolytic adenoviruses utilizing Adenovirus type 3 receptors.
14680,We hope that these data will help to foster the clinical translation of oncolytic adenoviruses including those with Ad3 retargeted tropism.
14681, Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a recently discovered pathogen first identified in respiratory specimens from young children suffering from clinical respiratory syndromes ranging from mild to severe lower respiratory tract illness.
14682,"HMPV has worldwide prevalence, and is a leading cause of respiratory tract infection in the first years of life, with a spectrum of disease similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)."
14683,"The disease burden associated with HMPV infection has not been fully elucidated; however, studies indicate that HMPV may cause upper or lower respiratory tract illness in patients between ages 2 months and 87 years, may co-circulate with RSV, and HMPV infection may be associated with asthma exacerbation."
14684,"The mechanisms and effector pathways contributing to immunity or disease pathogenesis following infection are not fully understood; however, given the clinical significance of HMPV, there is a need for a fundamental understanding of the immune and pathophysiological processes that occur following infection to provide the foundation necessary for the development of effective vaccine or therapeutic intervention strategies."
14685,"This review provides a current perspective on the processes associated with HMPV infection, immunity, and disease pathogenesis."
14686,"Saffold virus (SAFV), a human cardiovirus, is occasionally detected in infants with neurological disorders, including meningitis and cerebellitis."
14687,"We recently reported that SAFV type 3 isolates infect cerebellar glial cells, but not large neurons, in mice."
14688,"However, the impact of this infection remained unclear."
14689,"Here, we determined the neuropathogenesis of SAFV type 3 in the cerebella of neonatal ddY mice by using SAFV passaged in the cerebella of neonatal BALB/c mice."
14690,The virus titer in the cerebellum increased following the inoculation of each of five passaged strains.
14691,The fifth passaged strain harbored amino acid substitutions in the VP2 (H160R and Q239R) and VP3 (K62M) capsid proteins.
14692,Molecular modeling of the capsid proteins suggested that the VP2-H160R and VP3-K62M mutations alter the structural dynamics of the receptor binding surface via the formation of a novel hydrophobic interaction between the VP2 puff B and VP3 knob regions.
14693,"Compared with the original strain, the passaged strain showed altered growth characteristics in human-derived astroglial cell lines and greater replication in the brains of neonatal mice."
14694,"In addition, the passaged strain was more neurovirulent than the original strain, while both strains infected astroglial and neural progenitor cells in the mouse brain."
14695,"Intracerebral inoculation of either the original or the passaged strain affected brain Purkinje cell dendrites, and a high titer of the passaged strain induced cerebellar hypoplasia in neonatal mice."
14696,"Thus, infection by mouse-passaged SAFV affected cerebellar development in neonatal mice."
14697,This animal model contributes to the understanding of the neuropathogenicity of SAFV infections in infants.
14698,"IMPORTANCE Saffold virus (SAFV) is a candidate neuropathogenic agent in infants and children, but the neuropathogenicity of the virus has not been fully elucidated."
14699,"Recently, we evaluated the pathogenicity of two clinical SAFV isolates in mice."
14700,"Similar to other neurotropic picornaviruses, these isolates showed mild infectivity of glial and neural progenitor cells, but not of large neurons, in the cerebellum."
14701,"However, the outcome of this viral infection in the cerebellum has not been clarified."
14702,"Here, we examined the tropism of SAFV in the cerebellum."
14703,We obtained an in vivo-passaged strain from the cerebella of neonatal mice and examined its genome and its neurovirulence in the neonatal mouse brain.
14704,"The passaged virus showed high infectivity and neurovirulence in the brain, especially the cerebellum, and affected cerebellar development."
14705,This unique neonatal mouse model will be helpful for elucidating the neuropathogenesis of SAFV infections occurring early in life.
14706, Zika virus (ZIKV) is a human-pathogenic flavivirus that has recently emerged as a global public health threat.
14707,ZIKV infection may be associated with congenital malformations in infected fetuses and severe neurological and systemic complications in infected adults.
14708,There are currently limited treatment options for ZIKV infection.
14709,AR-12 (OSU-03012) is a celecoxib derivative cellular kinase inhibitor that has broad-spectrum antiviral activities.
14710,"In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of AR-12 against ZIKV."
14711,"We evaluated the in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12, using cell protection and virus yield reduction assays, in multiple clinically relevant cell lines, and the in vivo treatment effects of AR-12 in a lethal mouse model using type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice."
14712,AR-12 inhibited ZIKV strains belonging to both the African and Asian/American lineages in Huh-7 and/or neuronal cells.
14713,AR12's IC50 against ZIKV was consistently <2 μM in these cells.
14714,"ZIKV-infected A129 mice treated with intraperitoneally or orally administered AR-12 had significantly higher survival rate (50.0%–83.3% vs 0%, P < 0.05), less body weight loss, and lower blood and tissue ZIKV RNA loads than untreated control A129 mice."
14715,These anti-ZIKV effects were likely the results of down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by AR-12.
14716,Clinical trials using the clinically available and broad-spectrum AR-12 as an empirical treatment should be considered especially for patients residing in or returning from areas endemic of ZIKV and other arboviral infections who present with an acute undifferentiated febrile illness.
14717,The use of viral-mediated gene transfer in animal behavioral experiments has become very popular over the last decade.
14718,Altering gene regulation and assessing subsequent behavior can be a useful tool in unraveling a specific gene’s contributions to complex behavioral processes such as depressive-like behavior.
14719,"However, these types of experiments require detailed planning and designs to avoid pitfalls associated with issues such as surgical procedure or the peak of viral expression."
14720,This chapter is intended to be a primer on the design of such experiments and aims to discuss factors that must be considered in the early phases of experimental planning.
14721,"The known genetic diversity of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses has increased greatly in recent years through the discovery of viruses related to hepatitis C virus and human pegivirus in bats, bovines, equines, primates, and rodents."
14722,Analysis of these new species is important for research into animal models of hepatitis C virus infection and into the zoonotic origins of human viruses.
14723,"Here, we provide the first systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of these two genera at the whole-genome level."
14724,Phylogenies confirmed that hepatitis C virus is most closely related to viruses from horses whereas human pegiviruses clustered with viruses from African primates.
14725,"Within each genus, several well-supported lineages were identified and viral diversity was structured by both host species and location of sampling."
14726,"Recombination analyses provided evidence of interspecific recombination in hepaciviruses, but none in the pegiviruses."
14727,Putative mosaic genome structures were identified in NS5B gene region and were supported by multiple tests.
14728,The identification of interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses represents an important evolutionary event that could be clarified by future sampling of novel viruses.
14729,We also identified parallel amino acid changes shared by distantly related lineages that infect similar types of host.
14730,Notable parallel changes were clustered in the NS3 and NS4B genes and provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of the evolution of Hepacivirus host–virus interactions.
14731,A review of the literature reveals that ozone (O3) exposure can either suppress or enhance immune responsiveness.
14732,"These disparate effects elicited by O3 exposure depend, in large part, on the experimental design used, the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied."
14733,"Despite the apparent contradictions, a general pattern of response to O3 exposure can be recognized."
14734,"Most studies indicate that continuous O3 exposure leads to an early (days 0-3) impairment of immune responsiveness followed, with continued exposures, by a form of adaptation to O3 that results in a re-establishment of the immune response."
14735,The effects of O3 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which O3 exposure occurred.
14736,"Whereas O3 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen, O3 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen."
14737,"Although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung, numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that O3 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity."
14738,Novel Mechanistic Insights into Viral Modulation of Immune Receptor Signaling
14739,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a pediatric vasculitis syndrome that is often involves coronary artery lesions (e. g., coronary artery aneurysms)."
14740,"Although its causal factors and entire pathogenesis remain elusive, the available evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of KD is closely associated with dysregulation of immune responses to various viruses or microbes."
14741,"In this short review, we address several essential aspects of the etiology of KD with respect to the immune response to infectious stimuli: 1) the role of viral infections, 2) the role of bacterial infections and the superantigen hypothesis, 3) involvement of innate immune response including pathogens/microbe-associated molecular patterns and complement pathways, and 4) the influence of genetic background on the response to infectious stimuli."
14742,"Based on the clinical and experimental evidence, we discuss the possibility that a wide range of microbes and viruses could cause KD through common and distinct immune processes."
14743, We had earlier proposed a hypothesis to explain the mechanism of perpetuation of immunological memory based on the operation of idiotypic network in the complete absence of antigen.
14744,Experimental evidences were provided for memory maintenance through anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) carrying the internal image of the antigen.
14745,"In the present work, we describe a structural basis for such memory perpetuation by molecular modeling and structural analysis studies."
14746,A three-dimensional model of Ab2 was generated and the structure of the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein H of Rinderpest virus was modeled using the structural template of hemagglutinin protein of Measles virus.
14747,Our results show that a large portion of heavy chain containing the CDR regions of Ab2 resembles the domain of the hemagglutinin housing the epitope regions.
14748,"The similarity demonstrates that an internal image of the H antigen is formed in Ab2, which provides a structural basis for functional mimicry demonstrated earlier."
14749,This work brings out the importance of the structural similarity between a domain of hemagglutinin protein to that of its corresponding Ab2.
14750,It provides evidence that Ab2 is indeed capable of functioning as surrogate antigen and provides support to earlier proposed relay hypothesis which has provided a mechanism for the maintenance of immunological memory.
14751," Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Astroviridae family."
14752,Astroviruses infect diverse hosts and are typically associated with gastrointestinal illness; although disease can range from asymptomatic to encephalitis depending on the host and viral genotype.
14753,Astroviruses have high genetic variability due to an error prone polymerase and frequent recombination events between strains.
14754,"Once thought to be species specific, recent evidence suggests astroviruses can spread between different host species, although the frequency with which this occurs and the restrictions that regulate the process are unknown."
14755,Recombination events can lead to drastic evolutionary changes and contribute to cross-species transmission events.
14756,"This work reviews the current state of research on astrovirus evolution and emergence, especially as it relates to cross-species transmission and recombination of astroviruses."
14757, Calf diarrhea is a major economic burden for the US cattle industry.
14758,A variety of infectious agents are implicated in calf diarrhea and co-infection of multiple pathogens is not uncommon in diarrheic calves.
14759,A case–control study was conducted to assess infectious etiologies associated with calf diarrhea in Midwest cattle farms.
14760,"A total of 199 and 245 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively, from 165 cattle farms."
14761,"Samples were tested by a panel of multiplex PCR assays for 11 enteric pathogens: bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine torovirus (BToV) Salmonella spp."
14762,"(Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99+, Clostridium perfringens with β toxin gene and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum)."
14763,The association between diarrhea and detection of each pathogen was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model.
14764,More than a half of the fecal samples from the diarrheic calves had multiple pathogens.
14765,"Statistically, BRV-A, BCoV, BNoV, Nebovirus, Salmonella, E. coli K99+, and C. parvum were significantly associated with calf diarrhea (p <0.05)."
14766,"Among them, C. parvum and BRV-A were considered to be the most common enteric pathogens for calf diarrhea with high detection frequency (33.7% and 27.1%) and strong odds ratio (173 and 79.9)."
14767,"Unexpectedly BNoV (OR=2.0) and Nebovirus (OR=16.7) were identified with high frequency in diarrheic calves, suggesting these viruses may have a significant contribution to calf diarrhea."
14768," Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV."
14769,"With the continuing spread of MERS-CoV, prophylactic and therapeutic treatments are urgently needed."
14770,"In this study, we prepared purified equine F(ab’)2 from horses immunized with MERS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing MERS-CoV S, M and E proteins."
14771,Both IgG and F(ab’)2 efficiently neutralized MERS-CoV replication in tissue culture.
14772,Passive transfer of equine immune antibodies significantly reduced virus titers and accelerated virus clearance from the lungs of MERS-CoV infected mice.
14773,Our data show that horses immunized with MERS-CoV VLPs can serve as a primary source of protective F(ab’)2 for potential use in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of exposed or infected patients.
14774,The Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) induces a severe disease that fulfils many requirements of an animal model of fulminant hepatic failure.
14775,"However, a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage is required, and it is unknown whether the RHDV induces liver autophagy and how it relates to apoptosis."
14776,"In this study, we attempted to explore which signalling pathways were involved in the autophagic response induced by the RHDV and to characterize their role in the context of RHDV pathogenesis."
14777,Rabbits were infected with 2 × 10(4) hemmaglutination units of a RHDV isolate.
14778,"The autophagic response was measured as presence of autophagic vesicles, LC3 staining, conversion of LC3-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II and changes in expression of beclin-1, UVRAG, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and p62/SQSTM1."
14779,RHDV-triggered autophagy reached a maximum at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and declined at 30 and 36 hpi.
14780,"Phosphorylation of mTOR also augmented in early periods of infection and there was an increase in the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones BiP/GRP78, CHOP and GRP94."
14781,"Apoptosis, measured as caspase-3 activity and expression of PARP-1, increased significantly at 30 and 36 hpi in parallel to the maximal expression of the RHDV capsid protein VP60."
14782,"These data indicate that RHDV infection initiates a rapid autophagic response, perhaps in an attempt to protect liver, which associates to ER stress development and is independent from downregulation of the major autophagy suppressor mTOR."
14783,"As the infection continues and the autophagic response declines, cells begin to exhibit apoptosis."
14784,": Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a reemerging pathogen causes a self limited illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia and arthralgia."
14785,"However, 10–20% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia which contributes to considerable morbidity."
14786,The exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood.
14787,The present study investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and host human components.
14788,METHODOLOGY: Bioinformatic tools were used to identify peptides of CHIKV E1 exhibiting similarity to host components.
14789,"Two peptides (A&B) were identified using several bioinformatic tools, synthesised and used to validate the results obtained in silico."
14790,An ELISA was designed to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples from CHIKV patients to these peptides.
14791,"Further, experiments were conducted in a C57BL/6J experimental mouse model to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were indeed capable of inducing pathology."
14792,"FINDINGS: The serum samples showed reactivity of varying degrees, indicating that these peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection."
14793,"Further, these peptides when injected into C57BL/6J mice were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice, similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone."
14794,"Additionally, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology in the skeletal muscles as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone."
14795,Collectively these observations validate the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 protein and host proteins does contribute to pathology in CHIKV infection.
14796," Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral disease that is endemic in China, Korea and Japan."
14797,No effective vaccine or specific treatment for SFTS is currently available.
14798,"Here, we used a mouse model to examine the effects of ribavirin, site-1 protease inhibitor PF-429242, steroids, and combination of minocycline and ciprofloxacin (MC) on SFTS infection."
14799,The antiserum from a patient who recovered from SFTS was also examined for its effect on mice.
14800,Administration of antiserum completely protected mice against lethal infection with SFTSV.
14801,It could also protect mice from showing clinical signs of the disease due to non-lethal infection.
14802,MC-treatment resulted in prolonged survival times during lethal infection.
14803,"Although other agents had no significant protective effects, they did not provide detrimental effects that could lead to progression of the disease in mice."
14804,Our results suggest that antiserum treatment may be clinically useful for post-exposure prophylaxis against SFTSV infection.
14805,The Systems Biology for Infectious Diseases Research program was established by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to investigate host-pathogen interactions at a systems level.
14806,This program generated 47 transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from 30 studies that investigate in vivo and in vitro host responses to viral infections.
14807,"Human pathogens in the Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae families, especially pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza A viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), were investigated."
14808,Study validation was demonstrated via experimental quality control measures and meta-analysis of independent experiments performed under similar conditions.
14809,"Primary assay results are archived at the GEO and PeptideAtlas public repositories, while processed statistical results together with standardized metadata are publically available at the Influenza Research Database (www.fludb.org) and the Virus Pathogen Resource (www.viprbrc.org)."
14810,"By comparing data from mutant versus wild-type virus and host strains, RNA versus protein differential expression, and infection with genetically similar strains, these data can be used to further investigate genetic and physiological determinants of host responses to viral infection."
14811," The braking of tolerance or unresponsiveness to self-antigens, involving the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, is a critical event leading to autoimmune diseases."
14812,The precise mechanisms by which this can occur are mostly unknown.
14813,"Viruses have been implicated in this process, among other etiological factors, such as genetic predisposition and cytokine activity."
14814,Several ways have been proposed by which a viral infection might break tolerance to self and trigger an autoreactive cascade that ultimately leads to the destruction of a specific cell type or an entire organ.
14815,The process termed ‘molecular mimicry’ and the use of transgenic models in which viral and host genes can be manipulated to analyze their effects in causing autoimmunity have been particular focuses for research.
14816,"For example, there is a transgenic murine model of virus-induced autoimmune disease, in which a known viral gene is selectively expressed as a self-antigen in β cells of the pancreas."
14817,"In these mice, insulin-dependent diabetes develops after either a viral infection, the release of a cytokine such as IFN-γ, or the expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.1 in the islets of Langerhans."
14818,Recent studies using this model have contributed to the understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced autoimmune disease and have furthered the design and testing of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.
14819,Cell-to-cell spread of retroviruses via virological synapse (VS) contributes to overall progression of disease.
14820,VS are specialized pathogen-induced cellular structures that facilitate cell-to-cell transfer of HIV-1 and HTLV-1.
14821,VS provide a mechanistic explanation for cell-associated retroviral replication.
14822,"While VS share some common features with neurological or immunological synapses, they also exhibit important differences."
14823,The role of VS might not be limited to human retroviruses and the emerging role of a plant synapse suggests that VS might well be conserved structures for cell-cell spreading of both animal and plant viruses.
14824,"Dissection of the VS is just at its beginning, but already offers ample information and fascinating insights into mechanisms of viral replication and cell-to-cell communication."
14825,"An analysis of the time evolution of the 2019-nCoV outbreak event in Italy is proposed and is based on the preliminary data at disposal (till March 11th, 2020) on one side, and on an epidemiological model recently used to describe the same epidemic event in the Wuhan region (February 2020) on the other side."
14826,"The equations of the model include the description of compartments like Susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious but not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic) (A), infectious with symptoms (I), hospitalized (H) and recovered (R)."
14827,"Further stratification includes quarantined susceptible (Sq), isolated exposed (Eq) and isolated infected (Iq) compartments."
14828,The equations are numerically solved for boundary (initial) conditions tuned on the Italian event.
14829,The role of quarantine is specifically emphasized and supports the strategies adopted providing a numerical description of the effects.
14830,AimKidney impairment is observed in patients with COVID-19.
14831,We aimed to demonstrate the effect of anti-COVID-19 agent remdesivir on renal fibrosis.MethodsRemdesivir and its active nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 were used to treat TGF-β stimulated renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal epithelial cells (HK2).
14832,"Cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay, and fibrotic markers were measured by Western blotting."
14833,Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice.
14834,Serum and kidneys were harvested.
14835,The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS.
14836,Renal and liver function were assessed.
14837,"Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining and Western blotting.ResultsRemdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells."
14838,Intraperitoneal injection or renal injection of remdesivir attenuated renal fibrosis of UUO kidneys.
14839,Renal and liver function were not changed in remdesivir treated UUO mice.
14840,"Remdesivir can not be detected, but two remdesivir metabolites were detected after injection.ConclusionRemdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis in obstructed kidneys."
14841,ABSTRACTA novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of an emergent severe respiratory disease (COVID-19) in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis.
14842,"By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs."
14843,"Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove."
14844,We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins.
14845,"Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts."
14846,Six weeks into the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak- it is time to consider strategies to impede the emergence of new zoonotic infections
14847,"In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19."
14848,"In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19."
14849,"This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care."
14850,The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate.
14851,"We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19."
14852,"In this study, the most alarming symptoms and features were also identified."
14853,"Finally, we used a separate dataset of COVID-19 patients to evaluate our developed model accuracy, and used confusion matrix to make an in-depth analysis of our classifiers and calculate the sensitivity and specificity of our model."
14854,The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide.
14855,"A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support."
14856,"Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality."
14857,"Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient."
14858,"Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS."
14859,"We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients."
14860,The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit.
14861,Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states.
14862,"By leveraging off-the-shelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators."
14863,Anthropization of natural habitats including climate change along with overpopulation and global travel have been contributing to emerging infectious diseases outbreaks.
14864,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, highlights such threats to human health, social stability and global trade and economy."
14865,We used species distribution modelling and environmental data from satellite imagery to model Blueprint Priority Diseases occurrences.
14866,"We constructed classical regression and Support Vector Machine models based on environmental predictor variables such as landscape, tree cover loss, climatic covariates."
14867,Models were evaluated and a weighed mean was used to map the predictive risk of disease emergence.
14868,"We mapped the predictive risk for filovirus, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and coronavirus diseases."
14869,"Elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates were found to significant factors influencing disease emergence."
14870,We also showed the relevance of disease biogeography and in the identification potential hotspots for Disease X in regions in Uganda and China.
14871,"In our current study, a newer amine functionalized guar gum derivative was studied for its efficacy in colonic drug delivery."
14872,Glycyrrhizic acid mono-ammonium salt was used as the model drug.
14873,Drug-loaded microparticles were formulated by ionic crosslinking using sodium tripolyphosphate.
14874,The Scanning Electron Microscopic study revealed spherical particles of sizes from 4.9 ± 3.8 μm to 6.9 ± 3.9 μm.
14875,The FT-IR studies presented a possible interaction between the drug and the polymer.
14876,The drug was encapsulated in amorphous form as observed from the powder X-Ray Diffraction studies.
14877,"A cumulative drug release study was carried out in simulated gastric, intestinal, and colonic fluids."
14878,The cumulative drug release studies presented a burst release followed by a sustained release of the drug in simulated colonic fluid containing rat cecal contents.
14879,The drug-polymer ratio was optimised using a 3(2) factorial design by taking the amounts of glycyrrhizic acid (X(1)) and guar gum alkyl amine (X(2)) as the independant variables.
14880,"The percent cumulative drug release at 240 mins (Q(240)), 720 mins (Q(720)), and at 1,440 mins (Q(1440)) were considered as the dependant variables."
14881,"The efficacy of the optimized formulation was studied in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced rat colitis model."
14882,"The tissue’s nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase activities were found to be much lower in the microparticle-treated group compared to free drug-treated group."
14883,The histology of the colonic tissue from the treated group of animals revealed almost no infiltration of inflammatory cells in the tissue for the microparticle-treated group of animals.
14884,The synthesized amine derivative of guar gum was found to be better in vitro with a better in vivo efficacy in the colonic delivery of glycyrrhizic acid monoammonium salt and can be considered as a newer modified biopolymer for colonic drug delivery.
14885,A Target Animal Safety protocol was used to examine adverse events in male and female Fischer F344/NTac rats treated with increasing doses of a subcutaneous implant of a lipid suspension of buprenorphine.
14886,A single injection of 0.65 mg/kg afforded clinically significant blood levels of drug for 3 days.
14887,"Chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis values with 2- to 10-fold excess doses of the drug-lipid suspension were within normal limits."
14888,Histopathology findings were unremarkable.
14889,The skin and underlying tissue surrounding the drug injection were unremarkable.
14890,"Approximately 25% of a cohort of rats given the excess doses of 1.3, 3.9, and 6.5 mg/kg displayed nausea-related behavior consisting of intermittent and limited excess grooming and self-gnawing."
14891,"These results confirm the safety of cholesterol-triglyceride carrier systems for subcutaneous drug delivery of buprenorphine in laboratory animals and further demonstrate the utility of lipid-based carriers as scaffolds for subcutaneous, long-acting drug therapy."
14892,Biomolecular NMR now contributes routinely to every step in the development of new chemical entities ahead of clinical trials.
14893,"The versatility of NMR — from detection of ligand binding over a wide range of affinities and a wide range of drug targets with its wealth of molecular information, to metabolomic profiling, both ex vivo and in vivo — has paved the way for broadly distributed applications in academia and the pharmaceutical industry."
14894,"Proteomics and initial target selection both benefit from NMR: screenings by NMR identify lead compounds capable of inhibiting protein–protein interactions, still one of the most difficult development tasks in drug discovery."
14895,"NMR hardware improvements have given access to the microgram domain of phytochemistry, which should lead to the discovery of novel bioactive natural compounds."
14896,Steering medicinal chemists through the lead optimisation process by providing detailed information about protein–ligand interactions has led to impressive success in the development of novel drugs.
14897,The study of biofluid composition — metabonomics — provides information about pharmacokinetics and helps toxicological safety assessment in animal model systems.
14898,"In vivo, magnetic resonance spectroscopy interrogates metabolite distributions in living cells and tissues with increasing precision, which significantly impacts the development of anticancer or neurological disorder therapeutics."
14899,An overview of different steps in recent drug discovery is presented to illuminate the links with the most recent advances in NMR methodology.
14900,"ABSTRACTPleiotropy, the concept that a single gene controls multiple distinct traits, is prevalent in most organisms and has broad implications for medicine and agriculture."
14901,Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits.
14902,"Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions."
14903,Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms.
14904,"However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci."
14905,"Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics."
14906,"We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1."
14907,"Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics."
14908,This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes.
14909,"Infectious tropical diseases have a huge effect in terms of mortality and morbidity, and impose a heavy economic burden on affected countries."
14910,These diseases predominantly affect the world’s poorest people.
14911,"Currently available drugs are inadequate for the majority of these diseases, and there is an urgent need for new treatments."
14912,This Review discusses some of the challenges involved in developing new drugs to treat these diseases and highlights recent progress.
14913,"While there have been notable successes, there is still a long way to go."
14914,"There is a large, global unmet need for the development of countermeasures to combat intracellular pathogens."
14915,"The development of novel antimicrobials is expensive and slow and typically focuses on selective inhibition of proteins encoded by a single pathogen, thereby providing a narrow spectrum of coverage."
14916,The repurposing of approved drugs targeting host functions required for microbial infections represents a promising alternative.
14917,This review summarizes progress and challenges in the repurposing of approved drugs as host-targeted broad-spectrum agents for the treatment of intracellular pathogens.
14918,"These strategies include targeting both cellular factors required for infection by various viruses, intracellular bacteria, and/or protozoa as well as factors that modulate the host immune response to these microbial infections."
14919,The repurposed approach offers complementary means to develop therapeutics against existing and emerging intracellular microbial threats.
14920,Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
14921,Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases.
14922,"However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e."
14923,compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options.
14924,"Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/)."
14925,"Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections."
14926,Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) also called sleeping sickness is caused by subspecies of the parasitic hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei that mostly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa.
14927,"The current chemotherapy of the human trypanosomiases relies on only six drugs, five of which have been developed more than 30 years ago, have undesirable toxic side effects and most of them show drug-resistance."
14928,Though development of new anti-trypanosomal drugs seems to be a priority area research in this area has lagged far behind.
14929,The given review mainly focus upon the recent synthetic and computer based approaches made by various research groups for the development of newer anti-trypanosomal analogues which may have improved efficacy and oral bioavailability than the present ones.
14930,The given paper also attempts to investigate the relationship between the various physiochemical parameters and anti-trypanosomal activity that may be helpful in development of potent anti-trypanosomal agents against sleeping sickness.
14931,Viral drug resistance is believed to be less likely to occur if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins.
14932,"In this study, we analyzed the feasibility of a crucial viral replication factor, namely, importin-α7, as a cellular drug target to combat pandemic influenza viruses."
14933,"Surprisingly, only five viral lung-to-lung passages were required to achieve 100% lethality in importin-α7(−/−) mice that otherwise are resistant."
14934,Viral escape from importin-α7 requirement was mediated by five mutations in the viral ribonucleoprotein complex and the surface glycoproteins.
14935,"Moreover, the importin-α7(−/−) mouse-adapted strain became even more virulent for wild-type mice than the parental strain."
14936,"These studies show that targeting host proteins may still result in viral escape by alternative pathways, eventually giving rise to even more virulent virus strains."
14937,"Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach to reduce viral drug resistance."
14938,"IMPORTANCE Here, we investigated the long-standing hypothesis based on in vitro studies that viral drug resistance occurrence is less likely if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins."
14939,"Here, we challenged this hypothesis by analyzing, in an in vivo animal model, the feasibility of targeting the cellular factor importin-α7, which is crucial for human influenza virus replication and pathogenesis, as an efficient antiviral strategy against pandemic influenza viruses."
14940,"In summary, our studies suggest that resistance against cellular factors is possible in vivo, and the emergence of even more virulent viral escape variants calls for particular caution."
14941,"Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach using compounds against viral as well as cellular factors to reduce the risk of viral drug resistance and potentially increased virulence."
14942,"Amiodarone [2-butyl-3-(3′,5′-diiodo-4’α-diethylaminoethoxybenzoyl)-benzofuran] (AMD), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is known to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxic reactions in human patients."
14943,One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity.
14944,"To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of AMD or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce low-level inflammation."
14945,"Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities as well as increased total bile acid concentrations in serum and midzonal hepatocellular necrosis were observed only in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats."
14946,"The time interval between AMD and LPS administration was critical: AMD injected 16 h before LPS led to liver injury, whereas AMD injected 2–12 h before LPS failed to cause this response."
14947,The increase in ALT activity in AMD/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with AMD as well as LPS.
14948,The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of AMD were not affected by LPS coexposure.
14949,Serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was significantly increased by LPS and was slightly prolonged by AMD.
14950,"In Hepac1c7 cells, addition of TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and its primary metabolite, mono-N-desethylamiodarone."
14951,In vivo inhibition of TNF signaling by etanercept attenuated the AMD/LPS-induced liver injury in rats.
14952,"In summary, AMD treatment during modest inflammation induced severe hepatotoxicity in rats, and TNF contributed to the induction of liver injury in this animal model of idiosyncratic AMD-induced liver injury."
14953,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by a mutated feline coronavirus, is one of the most serious and fatal viral diseases in cats."
14954,"The disease remains incurable, and there is no effective vaccine available."
14955,"In light of the pathogenic mechanism of feline coronavirus that relies on endosomal acidification for cytoplasmic entry, a novel vacuolar ATPase blocker, diphyllin, and its nanoformulation are herein investigated for their antiviral activity against the type II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)."
14956,"Experimental results show that diphyllin dose-dependently inhibits endosomal acidification in fcwf-4 cells, alters the cellular susceptibility to FIPV, and inhibits the downstream virus replication."
14957,"In addition, diphyllin delivered by polymeric nanoparticles consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) further demonstrates an improved safety profile and enhanced inhibitory activity against FIPV."
14958,"In an in vitro model of antibody-dependent enhancement of FIPV infection, diphyllin nanoparticles showed a prominent antiviral effect against the feline coronavirus."
14959,"In addition, the diphyllin nanoparticles were well tolerated in mice following high-dose intravenous administration."
14960,This study highlights the therapeutic potential of diphyllin and its nanoformulation for the treatment of FIP.
14961,Position Paper: EUFEPS Network on Veterinary Medicines Initiative
14962,Antiviral agents have been hailed to hold considerable promise for the treatment and prevention of emerging viral diseases like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS.
14963,"However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown."
14964,We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs.
14965,"Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions."
14966,"To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment."
14967,"This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen."
14968,Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective.
14969,"In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible."
14970,"It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs."
14971,Knocking down expression of disease-related genes using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has potential for treating a variety of illnesses.
14972,"This Essay will examine the opportunities for harnessing RNA interference (RNAi) for therapy, as well as the obstacles and possible ways to circumvent them."
14973,"During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Western Africa (2013‒2016), antimalarial treatment was administered to EVD patients due to the high coexisting malaria burden in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines."
14974,"In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine."
14975,"As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine."
14976,"Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections."
14977,We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD.
14978,"Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans."
14979,"However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals."
14980,"While amodiaquine on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine when used in combination with artesunate or another antiviral."
14981,Computational (in silico) methods have been developed and widely applied to pharmacology hypothesis development and testing.
14982,"These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, similarity searching, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer."
14983,"Such methods have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization."
14984,The first part of this review discussed the methods that have been used for virtual ligand and target-based screening and profiling to predict biological activity.
14985,The aim of this second part of the review is to illustrate some of the varied applications of in silico methods for pharmacology in terms of the targets addressed.
14986,We will also discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of in silico methods with respect to in vitro and in vivo methods for pharmacology research.
14987,"Our conclusion is that the in silico pharmacology paradigm is ongoing and presents a rich array of opportunities that will assist in expediating the discovery of new targets, and ultimately lead to compounds with predicted biological activity for these novel targets."
14988,"Extended-release buprenorphine is an effective analgesic in laboratory animals, and its safety has been established in mice but not in rats."
14989,The authors used a target animal safety trial to evaluate the safety of extended-release buprenorphine in rats.
14990,"Fischer 344 rats received post-surgical subcutaneous injections of 1.3 mg, 3.9 mg or 6.5 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight (two times, six times or ten times the intended dose, respectively), and their body weight, clinical signs and symptoms, clinical pathology and histopathology were monitored for 4 d. Body weight was not significantly different in rats that received buprenorphine compared with control rats."
14991,Signs of nausea-related behavior were observed in 25% of the rats treated with buprenorphine.
14992,"Clinical pathology results for all rats were normal, and gross and microscopic histopathology examinations identified no substantial abnormalities, suggesting that this behavior was of minor consequence."
14993,"Other adverse events previously reported to occur with opiate therapy, including weight loss and dermal lesions at drug injection sites, were not observed in this study."
14994,"The results of this study show that post-surgical administration of an extended-release buprenorphine product is safe in Fischer 344 rats and does not necessarily cause substantial adverse effects, confirming that opiate therapy is a viable choice in laboratory animal medicine."
14995,"Griffithsin (GRFT) is a red alga-derived lectin with demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome–Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)."
14996,"However, its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined."
14997,"Here, Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of GRFT at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes, respectively, and serum GRFT levels were measured at select time points."
14998,"In addition, the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with GRFT (20 or 40 mg/kg)."
14999,"We found that parenterally-administered GRFT in rats displayed a complex elimination profile, which varied according to administration routes."
15000,"However, GRFT was not orally bioavailable, even after chronic treatment."
15001,"Nonetheless, active GRFT capable of neutralizing HIV-Env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing."
15002,"These findings support further evaluation of GRFT for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available, including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses."
15003,"In addition, GRFT should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of HIV-1 and other susceptible viruses."
15004," Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv)."
15005,"Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16·5 mg kg−1 bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with fipv."
15006,"All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP."
15007,Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened.
15008,The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5·5 mg kg−1 bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg−1) intravenously.
15009,"Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure."
15010,"There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only."
15011,"Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against fipv and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against fip."
15012," The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens for which diminishing treatment options are available is of major global concern."
15013,"New viral respiratory tract infections with epidemic potential, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine-origin influenza A H1N1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, require development of new antiviral agents."
15014,"The substantial rise in the global numbers of patients with respiratory tract infections caused by pan-antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and multiazole-resistant fungi has focused attention on investments into development of new drugs and treatment regimens."
15015,"Successful treatment outcomes for patients with respiratory tract infections across all health-care settings will necessitate rapid, precise diagnosis and more effective and pathogen-specific therapies."
15016,"This Series paper describes the development and use of new antimicrobial agents and immune-based and host-directed therapies for a range of conventional and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of respiratory tract infections."
15017,The discovery and characterization of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway has been one of the most important scientific developments of the last 12 years.
15018,RNAi is a cellular pathway wherein small RNAs control the expression of genes by either degrading homologous RNAs or preventing the translation of RNAs with partial homology.
15019,It has impacted basic biology on two major fronts.
15020,"The first is the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate almost every cellular process and are required for some viral infections, including hepatitis C virus (HCV)."
15021,The second front is the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as the first robust tool for mammalian cellular genetics.
15022,This has led to the identification of hundreds of cellular genes that are important for HCV infection.
15023,There is now a major push to adapt RNAi technology to the clinic.
15024,"In this review, we explore the impact of RNAi in understanding HCV biology, the progress in design of RNAi-based therapeutics for HCV, and remaining obstacles."
15025," Various 1-(amino-N-arylmethanethio)-3-(1-substituted benzyl-2, 3-dioxoindolin-5-yl) urea (5a–p) were designed keeping in view the structural requirements suggested in the pharmacophore model for anticonvulsant activity."
15026,"Their in vivo anticonvulsant screenings were performed by two most adopted seizure models, maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ)."
15027,"Compound 5f was found active in MES screening while compounds 5h, 5i, 5k and 5l showed significant anticonvulsant activity in both the screenings and were devoid of any neurotoxicity."
15028,Compound 5h and 5i showed marked protection at 300mg/kg against MES and scPTZ screening.
15029,Compound 5i also showed protection against MES screening at the dose of 100mg/kg.
15030,In 6Hz screening these two compounds showed significant protection and emerged as lead compounds for future investigations.
15031," Phenolic acids, the main active ingredients in Flos Lonicerae extract possess strong antibacterial, antioxidant and antiviral effects, and their contents was higher largely than that of other ingredients such as flavones, but the absolute bioavailability orally was significantly low, which is significant low influencing clinical efficacies of its oral preparations."
15032,"In the present study, in vitro Caco-2 cell, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and in vivo pharmacokinetics study were performed to investigate the effects of COS on the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids."
15033,The pharmacological effects such as antiviral activity improvement by COS were verified by MDCK cell damage inhibition rate after influenza virus propagation.
15034,The observations from in vitro Caco-2 cell showed that the absorption of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract could be improved by COS.
15035,"Meanwhile, COS at the same low, medium and high concentrations caused a significant, concentration-dependent increase in the P app-value for phenolic acids compared to the control group (p <0.05), and was all safe for the Caco-2 cells."
15036,The observations from single-pass intestinal perfusion in situ model showed that the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids can be enhanced by COS.
15037,"Meanwhile, the absorption enhancing effect of phenolic acids might be saturable in different intestine sites."
15038,"In pharmacokinetics study, COS at dosage of 25mg/kg improved the bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract to the greatest extent, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation."
15039,"Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae extract with COS at dosage of 25mg/kg prevented MDCK cell damage upon influenza virus propagation better than that of control."
15040,All findings above suggested that COS at dosage of 25mg/kg might be safe and effective absorption enhancer for improving the bioavailability of phenolic acids and the antiviral activity in vitro in Flos Lonicerae extract.
15041,Budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are two popular model organisms for virus research.
15042,They are natural hosts for viruses as they carry their own indigenous viruses.
15043,"Both yeasts have been used for studies of plant, animal and human viruses."
15044,"Many positive sense (+) RNA viruses and some DNA viruses replicate with various levels in yeasts, thus allowing study of those viral activities during viral life cycle."
15045,Yeasts are single cell eukaryotic organisms.
15046,"Hence, many of the fundamental cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation or programed cell death are highly conserved from yeasts to higher eukaryotes."
15047,"Therefore, they are particularly suited to study the impact of those viral activities on related cellular activities during virus-host interactions."
15048,Yeasts present many unique advantages in virus research over high eukaryotes.
15049,Yeast cells are easy to maintain in the laboratory with relative short doubling time.
15050,"They are non-biohazardous, genetically amendable with small genomes that permit genome-wide analysis of virologic and cellular functions."
15051,"In this review, similarities and differences of these two yeasts are described."
15052,"Studies of virologic activities such as viral translation, viral replication and genome-wide study of virus-cell interactions in yeasts are highlighted."
15053,Impacts of viral proteins on basic cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation and programed cell death are discussed.
15054,Potential applications of using yeasts as hosts to carry out functional analysis of small viral genome and to develop high throughput drug screening platform for the discovery of antiviral drugs are presented.
15055,Chapter 21 Other Forms of Immunosuppression
15056, The efficacy of the anti-inflammatory drug Bobel-24 against experimental infection by Cryptosporidium parvum was evaluated in neonatal lambs.
15057,The animals were treated by oral administration of the drug at 50 or 500mg/kg of body weight.
15058,The prophylactic/therapeutic treatment was started 4h before inoculation of the lambs with oocysts and was continued for eight consecutive days.
15059,"The therapeutic treatment was initiated at the onset of diarrhoea, after confirmation of infection, and was continued for six consecutive days."
15060,Infection was monitored by daily examination of faecal samples from the first day until 30 days post-inoculation.
15061,"The criteria considered in evaluating development of the infection and the drug activity were: oocyst shedding, presence of diarrhoea and weight gain at 15 and 30 days post-inoculation."
15062,"Bobel-24 was effective as a prophylactic/therapeutic treatment at the lowest dose (50mg/kg of body weight); in the group treated with this dose of drug there was a longer prepatent period, a shorter patent period and a lower intensity of oocyst excretion than in the untreated control group, and the differences were all statistically significant (P <0.05)."
15063,"Moreover, one animal did not excrete oocysts, and two lambs had diarrhoea, for only 1 and 2 days."
15064,"In the group treated with the higher dose of the drug, the diarrhoea lasted for a significantly shorter period (P <0.05) than in the untreated group."
15065,Understanding the complex population biology and transmission ecology of multihost parasites has been declared as one of the major challenges of biomedical sciences for the 21st century and the Neglected Zoonotic Diseases (NZDs) are perhaps the most neglected of all the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).
15066,"Here we consider how multihost parasite transmission and evolutionary dynamics may affect the success of human and animal disease control programmes, particularly neglected diseases of the developing world."
15067,"We review the different types of zoonotic interactions that occur, both ecological and evolutionary, their potential relevance for current human control activities, and make suggestions for the development of an empirical evidence base and theoretical framework to better understand and predict the outcome of such interactions."
15068,"In particular, we consider whether preventive chemotherapy, the current mainstay of NTD control, can be successful without a One Health approach."
15069,"Transmission within and between animal reservoirs and humans can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences, driving the evolution and establishment of drug resistance, as well as providing selective pressures for spill‐over, host switching, hybridizations and introgressions between animal and human parasites."
15070,"Our aim here is to highlight the importance of both elucidating disease ecology, including identifying key hosts and tailoring control effort accordingly, and understanding parasite evolution, such as precisely how infectious agents may respond and adapt to anthropogenic change."
15071,"Both elements are essential if we are to alleviate disease risks from NZDs in humans, domestic animals and wildlife."
15072,Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have been hailed as ‘the next great wave of the biotechnology revolution’ starting with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) nearly 20 years ago to RNA interference (RNAi) currently.
15073,Is RNAi just the latest research tool or does it have real potential as a therapeutic drug modality?
15074,"As a research tool, it is evident that RNAi has revolutionized the biological sciences by allowing selective silencing of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression."
15075,"With the advent of the postgenomic era, RNAi offers a therapeutic platform on which to identify potential picomolar active drug candidates to any target, including those that are conventionally undruggable."
15076,"In this review, we will discuss the progress made in developing RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of respiratory diseases."
15077,Bear bile has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years.
15078,Modern investigations showed that it has a wide range of pharmacological actions with little toxicological side effect and the pure compounds have been used for curing hepatic and biliary disorders for decades.
15079,"However, extensive consumption of bear bile made bears endangered species."
15080,"In the 1980's, bear farming was established in China to extract bear bile from living bears with ""Free-dripping Fistula Technique""."
15081,Bear farming is extremely inhumane and many bears died of illness such as chronic infections and liver cancer.
15082,"Efforts are now given by non-governmental organizations, mass media and Chinese government to end bear farming ultimately."
15083,"At the same time, systematic research has to be done to find an alternative for bear bile."
15084,"In this review, we focused on the literature, laboratory and clinical results related to bear bile and its substitutes or alternative in English and Chinese databases."
15085,"We examined the substitutes or alternative of bear bile from three aspects: pure compounds derived from bear bile, biles from other animals and herbs from TCM."
15086,"We then discussed the strategy for stopping the trading of bear bile and issues of bear bile related to potential alternative candidates, existing problems in alternative research and work to be done in the future."
15087,Invasive candidiasis is an increasingly frequent cause of serious and often fatal infections in hospitalized and immunosuppressed patients.
15088,"Mortality rates associated with these infections have risen sharply due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of C. albicans and other Candida spp., highlighting the urgent need of new antifungal therapies."
15089,"Rhesus theta (θ) defensin-1 (RTD-1), a natural macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide, was recently shown to be rapidly fungicidal against clinical isolates of MDR C. albicans in vitro."
15090,"Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro."
15091,"In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans."
15092,RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice.
15093,"In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes."
15094,"Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity."
15095,Results of this study suggest that θ-defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis.
15096,Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors playing a fundamental role in sensing microbial invasion and initiating innate and adaptive immune responses.
15097,TLRs are also triggered by danger signals released by injured or stressed cells during sepsis.
15098,Here we focus on studies developing TLR agonists and antagonists for the treatment of infectious diseases and sepsis.
15099,"Positioned at the cell surface, TLR4 is essential for sensing lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria, TLR2 is involved in the recognition of a large panel of microbial ligands, while TLR5 recognizes flagellin."
15100,"Endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 are specialized in the sensing of nucleic acids produced notably during viral infections."
15101,"TLR4 and TLR2 are favorite targets for developing anti-sepsis drugs, and antagonistic compounds have shown efficient protection from septic shock in pre-clinical models."
15102,"Results from clinical trials evaluating anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 approaches are presented, discussing the challenges of study design in sepsis and future exploitation of these agents in infectious diseases."
15103,We also report results from studies suggesting that the TLR5 agonist flagellin may protect from infections of the gastrointestinal tract and that agonists of endosomal TLRs are very promising for treating chronic viral infections.
15104,"Altogether, TLR-targeted therapies have a strong potential for prevention and intervention in infectious diseases, notably sepsis."
15105,Tuberculosis is a major infectious disease that globally causes the highest human mortality.
15106,"From this aspect, this study was carried out to evaluate novel pharmacological activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin causing anti-tubercular activity/effects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)."
15107,"The anti-Mtb activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin were evaluated using different anti-Mtb indicator assays, such as the resazurin microtiter assay, the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system assay, and the Ogawa slant medium assay, as well as in vivo tests."
15108,"Artesunate showed selective anti-Mtb effects by strongly inhibiting the growth of Mtb compared to artemisinin, and consistently induced anti-Mtb activity/effects by effectively inhibiting Mtb in the MGIT 960 system and in Ogawa slant medium for 21 days with a single dose; its minimum inhibitory concentration was 300 µg/mL in in vitro testing."
15109,"Furthermore, artesunate demonstrated an anti-tubercular effect/action with a daily dose of 3.5 mg/kg in an in vivo test for four weeks, which did not indicate or induce toxicity and side effects."
15110,"These results demonstrate that artesunate effectively inhibits the growth and/or proliferation of Mtb through novel pharmacological activities/actions, as well as induces anti-Mtb activity."
15111,"This study shows its potential as a potent candidate agent for developing new anti-tuberculosis drugs of an effective/safe next generation, and suggests novel insights into its effective use by repurposing existing drugs through new pharmacological activity/effects as one of the substantive alternatives for inhibiting tuberculosis."
15112,The lengthy duration of multidrug therapy needed to cure tuberculosis (TB) poses significant challenges for global control of the disease.
15113,"Moreover, chronic inflammation associated with TB leads to pulmonary damage that can remain even after successful cure."
15114,"Thus, there is a great need for the development of effective shorter drug regimens to improve clinical outcome and strengthen TB control."
15115,Host-directed therapy (HDT) is emerging as a novel adjunctive strategy to enhance the efficacy and shorten the duration of TB treatment.
15116,"Previously, we showed that the administration of CC-3052, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE4i), reduced the host inflammatory response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and improved the antimicrobial efficacy of isoniazid (INH) in both the mouse and rabbit models."
15117,"In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics and explored the mechanism underlying the efficacy of a more potent PDE4i, CC-11050, as adjunct to INH treatment in a mouse model of pulmonary Mtb infection."
15118,Genome-wide lung transcriptome analysis confirmed the dampening of inflammation and associated network genes that we previously reported with CC-3052.
15119,"Consistent with the reduction in inflammation, a significant improvement in Mtb control and pathology was observed in the lungs of mice treated with CC-11050 plus INH, compared to INH alone."
15120,This important confirmatory study will be used to help design upcoming human clinical trials with CC-11050 as an HDT for TB treatment.
15121,"The West African Ebola epidemic has set in motion a collective endeavour to conduct accelerated clinical trials, testing unproven but potentially lifesaving interventions in the course of a major public health crisis."
15122,This unprecedented effort was supported by the recommendations of an ad hoc ethics panel convened in August 2014 by the WHO.
15123,"By considering why and on what conditions the exceptional circumstances of the Ebola epidemic justified the use of unproven interventions, the panel's recommendations have challenged conventional thinking about therapeutic development and clinical research ethics."
15124,"At the same time, unanswered ethical questions have emerged, in particular: (i) the specification of exceptional circumstances, (ii) the specification of unproven interventions, (iii) the goals of interventional research in terms of individual versus collective interests, (iv) the place of adaptive trial designs and (v) the exact meaning of compassionate use with unapproved interventions."
15125,"Examination of these questions, in parallel with empirical data from research sites, will help build pragmatic foundations for disaster research ethics."
15126,"Furthermore, the Ebola clinical trials signal an evolution in the current paradigms of therapeutic research, beyond the case of epidemic emergencies."
15127,The rapid identification of highly specific and potent drug candidates continues to be a substantial challenge with traditional pharmaceutical approaches.
15128,"Moreover, many targets have proven to be intractable to traditional small-molecule and protein approaches."
15129,Therapeutics based on RNA interference (RNAi) offer a powerful method for rapidly identifying specific and potent inhibitors of disease targets from all molecular classes.
15130,Numerous proof-of-concept studies in animal models of human disease demonstrate the broad potential application of RNAi therapeutics.
15131,The major challenge for successful drug development is identifying delivery strategies that can be translated to the clinic.
15132,"With advances in this area and the commencement of multiple clinical trials with RNAi therapeutic candidates, a transformation in modern medicine may soon be realized."
15133,[Image: see text] A disodium phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of the antitumor agent triptolide was prepared from the natural product in three steps (39% yield) and displayed excellent aqueous solubility at pH 7.4 (61 mg/mL) compared to the natural product (17 μg/mL).
15134,The estimated shelf life (t(90)) for hydrolysis of the prodrug at 4 °C and pH 7.4 was found to be two years.
15135,"In a mouse model of human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), the prodrug administered intraperitoneally was effective in reducing or eliminating xenograft tumors at dose levels as low as 0.3 mg/kg when given daily and at 0.9 mg/kg when given less frequently."
15136,"When given via intraperitoneal and oral routes at daily doses of 0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg, the prodrug was also effective and well tolerated in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer (A2780)."
15137,RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent and specific post-transcriptional gene silencing process.
15138,"Since its discovery, tremendous efforts have been made to translate RNAi technology into therapeutic applications for the treatment of different human diseases including respiratory diseases, by manipulating the expression of disease-associated gene(s)."
15139,"Similar to other nucleic acid-based therapeutics, the major hurdle of RNAi therapy is delivery."
15140,Pulmonary delivery is a promising approach of delivering RNAi therapeutics directly to the airways for treating local conditions and minimizing systemic side effects.
15141,It is a non-invasive route of administration that is generally well accepted by patients.
15142,"However, pulmonary drug delivery is a challenge as the lungs pose a series of anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers to drug delivery."
15143,Understanding these barriers is essential for the development an effective RNA delivery system.
15144,"In this review, the different barriers to pulmonary drug delivery are introduced."
15145,"The potential of RNAi molecules as new class of therapeutics, and the latest preclinical and clinical studies of using RNAi therapeutics in different respiratory conditions are discussed in details."
15146,We hope this review can provide some useful insights for moving inhaled RNAi therapeutics from bench to bedside.
15147,RNA interference (RNAi) quietly crept into biological research in the 1990s when unexpected gene-silencing phenomena in plants and flatworms first perplexed scientists.
15148,"Following the demonstration of RNAi in mammalian cells in 2001, it was quickly realized that this highly specific mechanism of sequence-specific gene silencing might be harnessed to develop a new class of drugs that interfere with disease-causing or disease-promoting genes."
15149,"Here we discuss the considerations that go into developing RNAi-based therapeutics starting from in vitro lead design and identification, to in vivo pre-clinical drug delivery and testing."
15150,We conclude by reviewing the latest clinical experience with RNAi therapeutics.
15151," Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of viral gene delivery vectors, and recent clinical trials have shown promising results."
15152,"However, the tight control of transgene expression is likely to be required for therapeutic applications and in some instances, for safety reasons."
15153,"For this purpose, several ligand-dependent transcription regulatory systems have been developed."
15154,"Among these, the tetracycline-regulatable system is by far the most frequently used and the most advanced towards gene therapy trials."
15155,"This review will focus on this system and will describe the most recent progress in the regulation of transgene expression in various organs, including the muscle, the retina and the brain."
15156,"Since the development of an immune response to the transactivator was observed following gene transfer in the muscle of nonhuman primate, focus will be therefore, given on the immune response to transgene products of the tetracycline inducible promoter."
15157,"Animal models of fungal infections are, and will remain, a key tool in the advancement of the medical mycology."
15158,"Many different types of animal models of fungal infection have been developed, with murine models the most frequently used, for studies of pathogenesis, virulence, immunology, diagnosis, and therapy."
15159,The ability to control numerous variables in performing the model allows us to mimic human disease states and quantitatively monitor the course of the disease.
15160,"However, no single model can answer all questions and different animal species or different routes of infection can show somewhat different results."
15161,"Thus, the choice of which animal model to use must be made carefully, addressing issues of the type of human disease to mimic, the parameters to follow and collection of the appropriate data to answer those questions being asked."
15162,This review addresses a variety of uses for animal models in medical mycology.
15163,It focuses on the most clinically important diseases affecting humans and cites various examples of the different types of studies that have been performed.
15164,"Overall, animal models of fungal infection will continue to be valuable tools in addressing questions concerning fungal infections and contribute to our deeper understanding of how these infections occur, progress and can be controlled and eliminated."
15165,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe disease in human with an overall case-fatality rate of >35%.
15166,Effective antivirals are crucial for improving the clinical outcome of MERS.
15167,"Although a number of repurposed drugs, convalescent-phase plasma, antiviral peptides, and neutralizing antibodies exhibit anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro, most are not readily available or have not been evaluated in nonhuman primates."
15168,"We assessed 3 repurposed drugs with potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-β1b) in common marmosets with severe disease resembling MERS in humans."
15169,"The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-β1b-treated animals had better outcome than the untreated animals, with improved clinical (mean clinical scores ↓50.9%–95.0% and ↓weight loss than the untreated animals), radiological (minimal pulmonary infiltrates), and pathological (mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia) findings, and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung (↓0.59–1.06 log(10) copies/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]; P < .050) and extrapulmonary (↓0.11–1.29 log(10) copies/GAPDH; P < .050 in kidney) tissues."
15170,"In contrast, all MMF-treated animals developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads (↑0.15–0.54 log(10) copies/GAPDH) than the untreated animals."
15171,The mortality rate at 36 hours postinoculation was 67% (untreated and MMF-treated) versus 0–33% (lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-β1b-treated).
15172,Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b alone or in combination should be evaluated in clinical trials.
15173,MMF alone may worsen MERS and should not be used.
15174,: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is recognised as an emerging disease in both humans and some animal species.
15175,"During the past few years, insights into human CDI epidemiology changed and C. difficile is also considered as an emerging community-acquired pathogen."
15176,Certain ribotypes (RT) are possibly associated with zoonotic transmission.
15177,The objective of this study was to assess the presence of C. difficile in a population of pets and to characterise the isolates.
15178,RESULTS: Faecal samples from a total of 90 diarrhoeic dogs and 24 from exotic animal species (both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic) were analysed.
15179,Clostridium difficile was isolated from 6 (6.7%) dogs and one reptile sample (4.2%).
15180,Four (66.7%) of the six dog strains were capable of producing toxins.
15181,"Four known different RTs were detected in dogs (010, 014, 123 and 358) and a new one was found in a faecal sample of an exotic animal."
15182,This new RT isolate was negative for all toxin genes tested and belonged to sequence type 347 which has been proposed as a Clade-III member.
15183,"Importantly, two dog strains showed a stable resistance to metronidazole (initial MIC values: 128 and 48 μg/ml)."
15184,CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implementation of antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programs to assess the prevalence of metronidazole resistance in dogs; molecular studies to elucidate C. difficile metronidazole resistance mechanisms are warranted.
15185,"Based on the similarity between the ribotypes observed in dogs and those described in humans, the zoonotic transmission should be further explored."
15186,"Furthermore, exotic animals have shown to harbor uncommon C. difficile strains which require further genomic studies."

15189," RNAi has rapidly become a powerful tool for drug target discovery and validation in cell culture, and now has largely displaced efforts with antisense and ribozymes."
15190,"Consequently, interest is rapidly growing for extension of its application to in vivo systems, such as animal disease models and human therapeutics."
15191,"Studies on RNAi have resulted in two basic methods for its use for gene selective inhibition: 1) cytoplasmic delivery of short dsRNA oligonucleotides (siRNA), which mimics an active intermediate of an endogenous RNAi mechanism and 2) nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes that express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which mimics the micro interfering RNA (miRNA) active intermediate of a different endogenous RNAi mechanism."
15192,Non‐viral gene delivery systems are a diverse collection of technologies that are applicable to both of these forms of RNAi.
15193,"Importantly, unlike antisense and ribozyme systems, a remarkable trait of siRNA is a lack of dependence on chemical modifications blocking enzymatic degradation, although chemical protection methods developed for the earlier systems are being incorporated into siRNA and are generally compatible with non‐viral delivery systems."
15194,"The use of siRNA is emerging more rapidly than for shRNA, in part due to the increased effort required to construct shRNA expression systems before selection of active sequences and verification of biological activity are obtained."
15195,"In contrast, screens of many siRNA sequences can be accomplished rapidly using synthetic oligos."
15196,It is not surprising that the use of siRNA in vivo is also emerging first.
15197,Initial in vivo studies have been reported for both viral and non‐viral delivery but viral delivery is limited to shRNA.
15198,"This review describes the emerging in vivo application of non‐viral delivery systems for RNAi for functional genomics, which will provide a foundation for further development of RNAi therapeutics."
15199,Of interest is the rapid adaptation of ligand‐targeted plasmid‐based nanoparticles for RNAi agents.
15200,These systems are growing in capabilities and beginning to pose a serious rival to viral vector based gene delivery.
15201,The activity of siRNA in the cytoplasm may lower the hurdle and thereby accelerate the successful development of therapeutics based on targeted non‐viral delivery systems.
15202,"The primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered coronavirus(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)."
15203,"Replication of this SARS coronavirus (SCV) occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract, and causes diffuse alveolar damage(2,7,8)."
15204,Lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS has prevented the rational development of a therapy against this disease.
15205,Here we show extensive SCV antigen expression in type 1 pneumocytes of experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) at 4 d postinfection (d.p.i.
15206,"), indicating that this cell type is the primary target for SCV infection early in the disease, and explaining the subsequent pulmonary damage."
15207,"We also show that prophylactic treatment of SCV-infected macaques with the antiviral agent pegylated interferon-α (IFN-α) significantly reduces viral replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and pulmonary damage, compared with untreated macaques."
15208,Postexposure treatment with pegylated IFN-α yielded intermediate results.
15209,"We therefore suggest that pegylated IFN-α protects type 1 pneumocytes from SCV infection, and should be considered a candidate drug for SARS therapy"
15210,"Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) has attracted much attention in consideration of its association with severe neurological complications including fetal microcephaly."
15211,"However, there are currently no prophylactic vaccines or therapeutic drugs approved for clinical treatments of ZIKV infection."
15212,"To determine the potential anti-ZIKV inhibitors, we screened a library of clinical drugs with good safety profiles."
15213,"Erythromycin estolate (Ery-Est), one of the macrolide antibiotics, was found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection in different cell types and significantly protect A129 mice from ZIKV-associated neurological signs and mortality."
15214,"Through further investigation, Ery-Est was verified to inhibit ZIKV entry by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane which resulted in the loss of ZIKV infectivity."
15215,"Furthermore, Ery-Est also showed inhibitory activity against dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV)."
15216,"Thus, Ery-Est may be a promising drug for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly pregnant women."
15217,: Human noroviruses are the primary causative agents of acute gastroenteritis and are a pressing public health burden worldwide.
15218,There are currently no vaccines or small molecule therapeutics available for the treatment or prophylaxis of norovirus infections.
15219,"An improved understanding of norovirus biology, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disease, has provided the impetus for a range of intense exploratory drug discovery efforts targeting viral and host factors."
15220,AREAS COVERED: An overview of norovirus inhibitors disclosed in the patent literature (2010-present) and Clinicaltrials.gov is presented.
15221,The review is further enriched and supplemented by recent literature reports.
15222,"EXPERT OPINION: Seminal discoveries made in recent years, including a better understanding of the pathobiology and life cycle of norovirus, the identification and targeting of multiple viral and host factors, the advent of a replicon system and a small animal model for the preclinical evaluation of lead compounds, and the availability of high resolution X-ray crystal structures that can be utilized in structure-based drug design and lead optimization campaigns, collectively suggest that a small molecule therapeutic and prophylactic for norovirus infection is likely to emerge in the not too distant future."
15223,Gram-negative pathogen–induced nosocomial infections and resistance are a most serious menace to global public health.
15224,"Qingfei Xiaoyan Wan (QF), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been used clinically in China for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, acute or chronic bronchitis and pulmonary infection."
15225,"In this study, the effects of QF on Pseudomonas aeruginosa–induced acute pneumonia in mice were evaluated."
15226,"The mechanisms by which four typical anti-inflammatory ingredients from QF, arctigenin (ATG), cholic acid (CLA), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and sinapic acid (SPA), regulate anti-inflammatory signaling pathways and related targets were investigated using molecular biology and molecular docking techniques."
15227,"The results showed that pretreatment with QF significantly inhibits the release of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8 and RANTES), reduces leukocytes recruitment into inflamed tissues and ameliorates pulmonary edema and necrosis."
15228,"In addition, ATG was identified as the primary anti-inflammatory agent with action on the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways."
15229,CLA and CGA enhanced the actions of ATG and exhibited synergistic NF-κB inactivation effects possibly via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.
15230,"Moreover, CLA is speculated to target FGFR and MEK firstly."
15231,"Overall, QF regulated the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways to inhibit pathogenic bacterial infections effectively."
15232,The envelope (E) protein from coronaviruses is a small polypeptide that contains at least one α-helical transmembrane domain.
15233,"Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism."
15234,"Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity."
15235,"Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication."
15236,We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric α-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity.
15237,"Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular α-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle."
15238,"The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM."
15239,Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up.
15240,"This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride."
15241,"The channel structure presented herein provides a possible rationale for inhibition, and a platform for future structure-based drug design of this potential pharmacological target."
15242," As we transition to an era of personalized medicine, it has become imperative to integrate genomics with pharmacological and toxicological discoveries to provide individualized care to patients."
15243,Animal models are extremely important in understanding this interface as well as in bridging the gap between basic science discoveries and clinical medicine.
15244,The complex nature of pharmacological and toxicological research involving exposure to xenobiotic and therapeutic compounds necessitates the use of animal models to better understand how these compounds interact with multiple organ systems and cell types.
15245,"As genomics has expanded, we have become increasingly aware of the impact an individual’s genetic makeup influences these responses."
15246,"Novel methods have emerged that allow for the rapid development of animal models containing mutant alleles, allowing investigators to model these complex genetic interactions in a dramatically shortened timeline."
15247,"In this chapter, we emphasize the methods and approaches that can be used in gene targeting, screening strategies, and a variety of genetically modified model organisms."
15248,"The goal is to provide toxicologists an up to date review on the creation of genetically engineered animal models, which can be used to model genetic susceptibility to disease."
15249,"Inhibition of host-encoded targets, such as the cyclophilins, provides an opportunity to generate potent, high barrier to resistance antivirals for the treatment of a broad range of viral diseases."
15250,"However, many host-targeted agents are natural products which can be difficult to optimize using synthetic chemistry alone."
15251,"We describe the orthogonal combination of bioengineering and semisynthetic chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a known cyclophilin inhibitor of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide origin in order to generate the drug candidate NVP018 (formerly BC556)."
15252,"NVP018 is a potent inhibitor of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 replication, shows minimal inhibition of major drug transporters and has a high barrier to generation of both HCV and HIV-1 resistance."
15253,Polyoxometalates are non-nucleoside analogs that have been proven to exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity.
15254,"In particular, Cs(2)K(4)Na[SiW(9)Nb(3)O(40)].H(2)O 1 shows low toxicity and high activity against HBV."
15255,"The preclinical pharmacokinetics of Compound 1 in rats were characterized by establishing and applying inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry method to determine the concentration of W in plasma, urine, feces, bile and organ samples."
15256,The quantitative ICP-MS method demonstrated good sensitivity and application in the pharmacokinetics study of polyoxometalates.
15257,The pharmacokinetic behavior of Compound 1 after intravenous or oral administration fit a two-compartment model.
15258,"T(max) ranges from 0.1 h to 3 h and the T(1/2) of Compound 1 is between 20 h and 30 h. The absolute bioavailability of Compound 1 at 45, 180 and 720 mg/kg groups were 23.68%, 14.67% and 11.93%, respectively."
15259,"The rates of plasma protein binding of Compound 1 at 9, 18 and 36 mg/ml of Compound 1 are 62.13±9.41%, 71.20±24.98% and 49.00±25.59%, respectively."
15260,"Compound 1 was widely distributed throughout the body, and high levels of compound 1 were found in the kidney and liver."
15261,"The level of Compound 1 in excretion was lower: 30% for urine, 0.28% for feces and 0.42% for bile, respectively."
15262,"For elaborate pharmacokinetic characteristics to be fully understood, the metabolism of Compound 1 needs to be studied further."
15263,The development and application of Laboratory Animal Science in China
15264,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), an incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) degrading enzyme, contains two forms and it can exert various physiological functions particular in controlling blood glucose through the action of GLP-1."
15265,"In diabetic use, the DPP-4 inhibitor can block the DDP-4 to attenuate GLP-1 degradation and prolong GLP-1 its action and sensitize insulin activity for the purpose of lowering blood glucose."
15266,"Nonetheless the adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors severely hinder their clinical applications, and notably there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources including chemical synthesis, herbs, and plants with fewer side effects."
15267,"In this review, we highlight various strategies, namely computational biology (in silico), in vitro enzymatic and cell assays, and in vivo animal tests, for seeking natural DPP-4 inhibitors from botanic sources including herbs and plants."
15268,The pros and cons of all approaches for new inhibitor candidates or hits will be under discussion.
15269," Zika fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKV), is an epidemic disease for which no effective therapy has been established."
15270,The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French Polynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence of fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome.
15271,"Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine, the early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a high priority."
15272,"To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated the effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with interferon-β (IFN-β), on ZIKV replication."
15273,"In mammalian cells, we observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and ZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect."
15274,"Furthermore, we found that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were highly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome."
15275,Ribavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice.
15276,These data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection.
15277,Our data provide a new insight into the mechanisms for inhibition of ZIKV replication and prevention of Zika fever.
15278,"Complementary and alternative medicine soughts and encompasses a wide range of approaches; its use begun in ancient China at the time of Xia dynasty and in India during the Vedic period, but thanks to its long-lasting curative effect, easy availability, natural way of healing, and poor side-effects it is gaining importance throughout the world in clinical practice."
15279,"We conducted a review describing the effects and the limits of using herbal products in chronic liver disease, focusing our attention on those most known, such as quercetin or curcumin."
15280,"We tried to describe their pharmacokinetics, biological properties, and their beneficial effects (as antioxidant role) in metabolic, alcoholic, and viral hepatitis (considering that oxidative stress is the common pathway of chronic liver diseases of different etiology)."
15281,"The main limit of applicability of CAM comes from the lacking of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials giving a real proof of efficacy of those products, so that anecdotal success and personal experience are frequently the driving force for acceptance of CAM in the population."
15282,The use of RNA interference (RNAi) is spreading rapidly to nearly every aspect of biomedical research.
15283,The gene silencing capability of RNAi is being used to study individual gene's biological function and role in biochemical pathways.
15284,"However, the efficacy of RNAi depends upon efficient delivery of the intermediates of RNAi, short interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) oligonucleotides."
15285,The delivery challenge is even greater when the aim is to inhibit the expression of target genes in animal models.
15286,"Although i n vivo delivery of siRNA is complicated and challenging, recent results are encouraging."
15287,"In this review, the latest developments of in vivo delivery of siRNA and the crucial issues related to this effort are addressed."
15288,Advances in cancer therapy have focused attention on the quality of life of cancer survivors.
15289,"Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies."
15290,"This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM)."
15291,"Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M)."
15292,"At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages."
15293,"Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage."
15294,"DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve."
15295,"Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol."
15296,T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC.
15297,"These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3."
15298,"Altered pain sensations such as hyperalgesia and allodynia are characteristic features of various pain states, and remain difficult to treat."
15299,We have shown previously that spinal application of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors induces strong antihyperalgesic effect during inflammatory pain.
15300,"In this study we observed low level of DPP4 mRNA in the rat spinal dorsal horn in physiological conditions, which did not change significantly either in carrageenan-induced inflammatory or partial nerve ligation-generated neuropathic states."
15301,"In naïve animals, microglia and astrocytes expressed DPP4 protein with one and two orders of magnitude higher than neurons, respectively."
15302,DPP4 significantly increased in astrocytes during inflammation and in microglia in neuropathy.
15303,"Intrathecal application of two DPP4 inhibitors tripeptide isoleucin-prolin-isoleucin (IPI) and the antidiabetic drug vildagliptin resulted in robust opioid-dependent antihyperalgesic effect during inflammation, and milder but significant opioid-independent antihyperalgesic action in the neuropathic model."
15304,"The opioid-mediated antihyperalgesic effect of IPI was exclusively related to mu-opioid receptors, while vildagliptin affected mainly delta-receptor activity, although mu- and kappa-receptors were also involved."
15305,None of the inhibitors influenced allodynia.
15306,"Our results suggest pathology and glia-type specific changes of DPP4 activity in the spinal cord, which contribute to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and interact with endogenous opioid systems."
15307,The effectiveness of RNA interference-based drugs is dependent on accumulation at the target site in therapeutically relevant amounts.
15308,"Local administration to the mucosal surfaces lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts allows access into diseased areas without the necessity to overcome serum nuclease degradation, rapid renal and hepatic clearance and non-specific tissue accumulation associated with systemic delivery."
15309,"This work describes RNAi therapeutics focused on pulmonary, oral, rectal and intravaginal routes of administration."
15310,Mucosal barrier components including site variations and delivery considerations are addressed in order to design an effective mucosal delivery strategy.
15311,RNA interference (RNAi) controls gene silencing in most living organisms.
15312,"The potential clinical applications of RNAi represent a strategy with unsurpassed selectivity, with the ability to target multiple disease-related genes, independent of their perceived drugability."
15313,"The design of highly selective and efficacious small interfering (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) has become routine, owing to significant progress in modeling and chemistry."
15314,"RNAi significantly downregulates gene expression and function both in vitro and in vivo, including in the brain."

15317,Advancing Priority Research on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
15318, More than 60% of human infectious diseases are caused by pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals.
15319,Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people.
15320,Some of these diseases have only emerged recently.
15321,"Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year."
15322,Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years.
15323,"We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings."
15324,"In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors."
15325,"This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats."
15326,"Meeting report: the 4(th) symposium on animal models of non-human primates in Kunming, Yunnan, China"
15327,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are highly conserved type 1 membrane proteins that initiate a multiplicity of transient gene transcriptions, resulting in innate and adaptive immune responses."
15328,These essential immune responses are triggered by common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products expressed through the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll/IL-1 domain.
15329,Toll/IL-1 adapter protein cascades are induced by an activated Toll/IL-1 to induce transient transcription responses.
15330,"All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, use an MyD88 adapter to Toll/IL-1 to initiate a proinflammatory cascade."
15331,TLR3 uses the toll receptor 3/4 induction factor adapter to initiate a different cytosolic adapter cascade with double-stranded RNA agonists.
15332,This non-MyD88 pathway induces both NF-κB and type 1 interferon responses.
15333,"By using a TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist, rintatolimod, we demonstrate significant unexpected differences in toxic responses between rats and primates."
15334,"The mechanism of this differential response is consistent with a relative down-regulation of the NF-κB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and humans, but not observed systemically in rat."
15335,Our findings suggest evaluation of TLR3 agonists in drug therapy.
15336,Virus entry into a susceptible host cell is the first step in the formation of all viral diseases.
15337,Controlling viral infections by disrupting viral entry is advantageous for antibody-mediated neutralization by the host’s immune system and as a preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategy.
15338,"Recently, several plant-derived carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) have emerged as a new class of antiviral biologics by taking advantage of a unique glycosylation pattern only found on the surface of viruses."
15339,"In particular, a red algae-derived griffithsin (GRFT) protein has demonstrated superior in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity with minimum host toxicity against a variety of clinically relevant, enveloped viruses."
15340,"This review examines the structural characteristics of GRFT, focusing on its carbohydrate-binding capability."
15341,Its in vitro antiviral profiles against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are also discussed followed by a description of the results from a combination study using anti-HIV drugs.
15342,The results of several studies regarding its novel antiviral mechanism of action are provided in conjunction with an explanation of viral resistance profiles to GRFT.
15343,"In addition, its in vitro and in vivo host toxicity profiles are summarized with its pharmacokinetic behavior using in vivo efficacy study results."
15344,"Also, a large-scale production and formulation strategy, as well as a drug delivery strategy, for GRFT as a new class of broad-spectrum microbicides is discussed."
15345,"Finally, results from two ongoing clinical studies examining GRFT’s effects on viruses are presented."
15346,Chemically synthesized short interfering RNA (siRNA) of pre-determined sequence has ushered a new era in the application of RNA interference (RNAi) against viral genes.
15347,We have paid particular attention to respiratory viruses that wreak heavy morbidity and mortality worldwide.
15348,"The clinically significant ones include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and influenza virus."
15349,"As the infection by these viruses is clinically restricted to the respiratory tissues, mainly the lungs, the logical route for the application of the siRNA was also the same, i.e., via the nasal route."
15350,"Following the initial success of intranasal siRNA against RSV, second-generation siRNAs were made against the viral polymerase large subunit (L) that were chemically modified and screened for improved stability, activity and pharmacokinetics."
15351,2′-O-methyl (2′-O-Me) and 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro (2′-F) substitutions in the ribose ring were incorporated in different positions of the sense and antisense strands and the resultant siRNAs were tested with various transfection reagents intranasally against RSV.
15352,"Based on these results, we propose the following consensus for designing intranasal antiviral siRNAs: (i) modified 19–27 nt long double-stranded siRNAs are functional in the lung, (ii) excessive 2′-OMe and 2′-F modifications in either or both strands of these siRNAs reduce efficacy, and (iii) limited modifications in the sense strand are beneficial, although their precise efficacy may be position-dependent."
15353,"Morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases are always on the rise, especially in poorer countries and in the aging population."
15354,"The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat."
15355,"HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era."
15356,"However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs."
15357,"In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision."
15358,"Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments."
15359,Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage.
15360,"The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications."
15361,"Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms."
15362," In the 50 years since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described, substantial progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for and the pathogenic contributors to the syndrome and in characterising the protein expression patterns in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS."
15363,"Despite this effort, however, pharmacological options for ARDS remain scarce."
15364,"Frequently cited reasons for this absence of specific drug therapies include the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS, the potential for a differential response to drugs, and the possibility that the wrong targets have been studied."
15365,"Advances in applied biomolecular technology and bioinformatics have enabled breakthroughs for other complex traits, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma, particularly when a precision medicine paradigm, wherein a biomarker or gene expression pattern indicates a patient's likelihood of responding to a treatment, has been pursued."
15366,"In this Review, we consider the biological and analytical techniques that could facilitate a precision medicine approach for ARDS."
15367," Disease fatality associated with Ebola, SARS-CoV and dengue infections in humans is attributed to a cytokine storm that is triggered by excessive pro-inflammatory responses."
15368,"Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively."
15369,"Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents."
15370,Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia.
15371,"It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)."
15372,Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical-signaling.
15373,"In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor-α converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli."
15374,"Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes."
15375,"Insults to the alveoli usually lead to inefficient gas exchange or even respiratory failure, which is difficult to model in animal studies."
15376,"Over the past decade, stem cell-derived self-organizing three-dimensional organoids have emerged as a new avenue to recapitulate respiratory diseases in a dish."
15377,Alveolar organoids have improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and pathological alterations in alveoli.
15378,"From this perspective, we review the state-of-the-art technology on establishing alveolar organoids from endogenous lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells or pluripotent stem cells, as well as the use of alveolar organoids for the study of respiratory diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis infection, and respiratory virus infection."
15379,We also discuss challenges that need to be overcome for future application of alveolar organoids in individualized medicine.
15380," In this chapter, we consider in silico modeling of diseases starting from some simple to some complex (and mathematical) concepts."
15381,"Examples and applications of in silico modeling for some important categories of diseases (such as for cancers, infectious diseases, and neuronal diseases) are also given."
15382,The pig is becoming increasingly important as a biomedical model.
15383,"Given the similarities between pigs and humans, a greater understanding of the underlying biology of human health and diseases may come from the pig rather than from classical rodent models."
15384,"With an increasing need for swine models, it is essential that the genomic tools, models and services be readily available to the scientific community."
15385,"Many of these are available through the National Swine Resource and Research Center (NSRRC), a facility funded by the US National Institutes of Health at the University of Missouri."
15386,The goal of the NSRRC is to provide high-quality biomedical swine models to the scientific community.
15387,RNA interference (RNAi) has been extensively employed for in vivo research since its use was first demonstrated in mammalian cells 10 years ago.
15388,"Design rules have improved, and it is now routinely possible to obtain reagents that suppress expression of any gene desired."
15389,"At the same time, increased understanding of the molecular basis of unwanted side effects has led to the development of chemical modification strategies that mitigate these concerns."
15390,Delivery remains the single greatest hurdle to widespread adoption of in vivo RNAi methods.
15391,"However, exciting advances have been made and new delivery systems under development may help to overcome these barriers."
15392,This review discusses advances in RNAi biochemistry and biology that impact in vivo use and provides an overview of select publications that demonstrate interesting applications of these principles.
15393,"Emphasis is placed on work with synthetic, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) published since the first installment of this review which appeared in 2006."
15394,Increasing epidemiological evidence indicates that perinatal infection with various viral pathogens enhances the risk for several psychiatric disorders.
15395,The pathophysiological significance of astrocyte interactions with neurons and/or gut microbiomes has been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders triggered by pre- and postnatal immune insults.
15396,Recent studies with the maternal immune activation or neonatal polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid models of neurodevelopmental disorders have identified various candidate molecules that could be responsible for brain dysfunction.
15397,"Here, we review the functions of several candidate molecules in neurodevelopment and brain function and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders."
15398,Secondary photoreceptor degenerations can be partially distinguished from primary photoreceptor degenerations based upon whether or not correction of the defect in the photoreceptors themselves would be sufficient to arrest photoreceptor death.
15399,"The distinction is by no means perfect, since there can be genetic mutations that affect directly the survival of photoreceptors as well as the survival of adjacent retinal or retinal pigment epithelium cells that could secondarily be critical for photoreceptor survival."
15400,"As we attempt to distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic causes of both primary and secondary photoreceptor degenerations, it is increasingly clear that complex interactions and mechanisms can be involved."
15401,"In 2012, the Bateson Review of research using non-human primates (NHPs) recommended the commissioning of a working group to identify and follow-up the results of UK-funded NHP research of potential benefit for human health (Recommendation 4), but the Medical Research Council (MRC) has postponed implementation of the recommendation."
15402,Information on results and potential benefits of NHP research therefore remains unavailable.
15403,"To fill this gap in knowledge, this study identified all published NHP research studies funded by the MRC, Wellcome Trust and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) from January 1997 to July 2012 and assessed full texts for medical relevance."
15404,"In total, 284 papers were identified, of which 51 (18%) involved invasive NHP research, compared to 176 (61%) which used NHP tissue and cell lines, indicating a shift in research emphasis from invasive whole animal to cell-based research."
15405,"Of these studies, 98 (35%) were medically relevant, of which 22 had potential therapeutic or public health applications."
15406,The relatively low proportion of medical studies together with the small number of applied studies raises questions over the level of investment in medical research and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from basic to applied research.
15407,Implementation of the Bateson Review’s Recommendation 4 would address these questions.
15408,Emerging evidence suggests that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors used to treat type 2 diabetes may have nephroprotective effects beyond the reduced renal risk conferred by glycemic control.
15409,DPP-4 is a ubiquitous protein with exopeptidase activity that exists in cell membrane-bound and soluble forms.
15410,"The kidneys contain the highest levels of DPP-4, which is increased in diabetic nephropathy."
15411,DPP-4 inhibitors are a chemically heterogeneous class of drugs with important pharmacological differences.
15412,"Of the globally marketed DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin is of particular interest for diabetic nephropathy as it is the only compound that is not predominantly excreted in the urine."
15413,"Linagliptin is also the most potent DPP-4 inhibitor, has the highest affinity for this protein, and has the largest volume of distribution; these properties allow linagliptin to penetrate kidney tissue and tightly bind resident DPP-4."
15414,"In animal models of kidney disease, linagliptin elicited multiple renoprotective effects, including reducing albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, independent of changes in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose levels."
15415,"At the molecular level, linagliptin prevented the pro-fibrotic endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition by disrupting the interaction between membrane-bound DPP-4 and integrin β1 that enhances signaling by transforming growth factor-β1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1."
15416,"Linagliptin also increased stromal cell derived factor-1 levels, ameliorated endothelial dysfunction, and displayed unique antioxidant effects."
15417,"Although the nephroprotective effects of linagliptin are yet to be translated to the clinical setting, the ongoing Cardiovascular and Renal Microvascular Outcome Study with Linagliptin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CARMELINA®) study will definitively assess the renal effects of this DPP-4 inhibitor."
15418,CARMELINA® is the only clinical trial of a DPP-4 inhibitor powered to evaluate kidney outcomes.
15419,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease including steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma."
15420,The development of transgenic mice expressing HCV proteins and the successful repopulation of SCID/Alb-uPA mice with human hepatocytes provides an important tool for unraveling virus–host interactions in vivo.
15421,Several of these mouse models exhibit aspects of HCV-related liver disease.
15422,"Thus, these in vivo models play an important role to further understand the pathogenesis of HCV infection and to evaluate the pre-clinical safety and efficacy of new antiviral compounds against HCV."
15423,This review summarizes the most important mouse models currently used to study HCV pathogenesis and infection.
15424,"Finally, the perspective of these models for future HCV research as well as the design of novel small animal models is discussed."
15425,The gene silencing capability of RNA interference (RNAi) is being used to study individual gene's biological function and role in biochemical pathways.
15426,"However, the efficacy of RNAi depends upon efficient delivery of the intermediates of RNAi, small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides."
15427,The delivery challenge is even greater when the aim is to inhibit the expression of target genes in disease tissues.
15428,"In vivo delivery of siRNA is complicated and challenging, and recent works on various animal disease models and early successes in human clinical trials are enlightening the tremendous potential of RNAi therapeutics."
15429,"In this chapter, the latest developments of in vivo delivery of siRNA and the critical issues related to this effort are addressed."
15430,2 Animals in Ophthalmic Research: Concepts and Methodologies
15431,Cancer and many other serious diseases are characterized by the uncontrolled growth of new blood vessels.
15432,"Recently, RNA interference (RNAi) has reinvigorated the therapeutic prospects for inhibiting gene expression and promises many advantages over binding inhibitors, including high specificity, which is essential for targeted therapeutics."
15433,"This article describes the latest developments using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors to downregulate various angiogenic and tumor-associated factors, both in cell-culture assays and in animal disease models."
15434,"The majority of research efforts are currently focused on understanding gene function, as well as proof-of-concept for siRNA-mediated anti-angiogenesis."
15435,"The prospects for siRNA therapeutics, both advantages and looming hurdles, are evaluated."
15436,"A decade has passed since the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the ACE2–angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)–Mas counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system (RAS)."
15437,"ACE2 is considered an endogenous regulator of the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, fibrotic, and proinflammatory effects of the ACE–Ang II–angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) axis."
15438,Both animal and clinical studies have emerged to define a role for ACE2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
15439,There is scientific evidence supporting the concept that ACE2 maintains the RAS balance and plays a protective role in PAH.
15440,The activation of pulmonary ACE2 could influence the pathogenesis of PAH and serve as a novel therapeutic target in PAH.
15441,"Current therapeutic strategies and interventions have limited success, and PAH remains a fatal disease."
15442,"Thus, more research that establishes the novel therapeutic potential and defines the mechanism of the ACE2–Ang-(1-7)–Mas counterregulatory axis in PAH is needed."
15443,Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract constitute a major cause of death worldwide.
15444,"Given the constant rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, treatment failure is increasingly frequent."
15445,"In this context, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed."
15446,Stimulation of innate immune cells in the respiratory tract [via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] is an attractive approach for rapidly activating the body's immune defenses against a broad spectrum of microorganisms.
15447,Previous studies of the TLR5 agonist flagellin in animal models showed that standalone TLR stimulation does not result in the effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection but does significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment.
15448,"Here, we investigated the antibacterial interaction between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection."
15449,"Using various doses of orally administered amoxicillin or systemically administered cotrimoxazole, we found that the intranasal instillation of flagellin (a dose that promotes maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses) induces synergistic rather than additive antibacterial effects against antibiotic–susceptible pneumococcus."
15450,We next set up a model of infection with pneumococcus that is resistant to multiple antibiotics in the context of influenza superinfection.
15451,"Remarkably, the combination of amoxicillin and flagellin effectively treated superinfection with the amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus since the bacterial clearance was increased by more than 100-fold compared to standalone treatments."
15452,"Our results also showed that, in response to flagellin, the lung tissue generated an innate immune response even though it had been damaged by the influenza virus and pneumococcal infections."
15453,"In conclusion, we demonstrated that the selective boosting of lung innate immunity is a conceptually advantageous approach for improving the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
15454,Traditional approaches to antimicrobial drug development are poorly suited to combatting the emergence of novel pathogens.
15455,"Additionally, the lack of small animal models for these infections hinders the in vivo testing of potential therapeutics."
15456,Here we demonstrate the use of the VelocImmune technology (a mouse that expresses human antibody-variable heavy chains and κ light chains) alongside the VelociGene technology (which allows for rapid engineering of the mouse genome) to quickly develop and evaluate antibodies against an emerging viral disease.
15457,"Specifically, we show the rapid generation of fully human neutralizing antibodies against the recently emerged Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and development of a humanized mouse model for MERS-CoV infection, which was used to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of the isolated antibodies."
15458,The VelocImmune and VelociGene technologies are powerful platforms that can be used to rapidly respond to emerging epidemics.
15459,Oxidative stress is considered as a major risk factor that contributes to increased lipid peroxidation and declined antioxidants in some degenerative diseases.
15460,Glycyrrhizin is widely used to cure allergic diseases due to its medicinal properties.
15461,"In the present study, we evaluated the role of glycyrrhizin on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in the blood and nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis (AR) mice."
15462,"Mice were divided into six groups: normal control mice, model control (MC) mice, three glycyrrhizin-treated mice groups and lycopene-treated mice."
15463,Sensitization-associated increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in the blood and nasal mucosa of MC mice.
15464,"Activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) and levels of glutathione (GSH) were found to be significantly decreased in the blood and nasal mucosa in MC mice when compared to normal control mice."
15465,"However, normalized lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defenses were reported in the glycyrrhizin-treated and lycopene-treated mice."
15466,"Moreover, glycyrrhizin treatment still enhanced IFN-γ and reduced IL-4 levels in glycyrrhizin-treated mice."
15467,These findings demonstrated that glycyrrhizin treatment enhanced the antioxidant status and decreased the incidence of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation and improved immunity activities in the blood and nasal mucosa of AR mice.
15468,"A major hallmark of the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is immune cell infiltration into the brain and spinal cord resulting in myelin destruction, which not only slows conduction of nerve impulses, but causes axonal injury resulting in motor and cognitive decline."
15469,Current treatments for MS focus on attenuating immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS).
15470,"These treatments decrease the number of relapses, improving quality of life, but do not completely eliminate relapses so long-term disability is not improved."
15471,"Therefore, therapeutic agents that protect the CNS are warranted."
15472,"In both animal models as well as human patients with MS, T cell entry into the CNS is generally considered the initiating inflammatory event."
15473,"In order to assess if a drug protects the CNS, any potential effects on immune cell infiltration or proliferation in the periphery must be ruled out."
15474,This protocol describes how to determine whether CNS protection observed after drug intervention is a consequence of attenuating CNS-infiltrating immune cells or blocking death of CNS cells during inflammatory insults.
15475,"The ability to examine MS treatments that are protective to the CNS during inflammatory insults is highly critical for the advancement of therapeutic strategies since current treatments reduce, but do not completely eliminate, relapses (i.e., immune cell infiltration), leaving the CNS vulnerable to degeneration."
15476,"Amoebiasis is a parasitic disease that causes thousands of deaths every year, its adverse effects and resistance to conventional treatments have led to the search of new treatment options, as well as the development of novel screening methods."
15477,"In this work, we implemented a 3D model of intestine and liver slices from hamsters that were infected ex vivo with virulent E. histolytica trophozoites."
15478,"Results show preserved histology in both uninfected tissues as well as ulcerations, destruction of the epithelial cells, and inflammatory reaction in intestine slices and formation of micro abscesses, and the presence of amoebae in the sinusoidal spaces and in the interior of central veins in liver slices."
15479,"The three chemically synthetized compounds T-001, T-011, and T-016, which act as amoebicides in vitro, were active in both infected tissues, as they decreased the number of trophozoites, and provoked death by disintegration of the amoeba, similar to metronidazole."
15480,"However, compound T-011 induced signs of cytotoxicity to liver slices."
15481,"Our results suggest that ex vivo cultures of precision-cut intestinal and liver slices represent a reliable 3D approach to evaluate novel amoebicidal compounds, and to simultaneously detect their toxicity, while reducing the number of experimental animals commonly required by other model systems."
15482,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, leading to an increase in unesterified cholesterol and several sphingolipids, and resulting in hepatic disease and progressive neurological disease."
15483,"Whereas subcutaneous administration of the pharmaceutical excipient 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) ameliorated hepatic disease, doses sufficient to reduce neurological disease resulted in pulmonary toxicity."
15484,"In contrast, direct administration of HPβCD into the cisterna magna of presymptomatic cats with NPC disease prevented the onset of cerebellar dysfunction for greater than a year and resulted in a reduction in Purkinje cell loss and near normal concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids."
15485,"Moreover, administration of intracisternal HPβCD to NPC cats with ongoing cerebellar dysfunction slowed disease progression, increased survival time, and decreased the accumulation of brain gangliosides."
15486,An increase in hearing threshold was identified as a potential adverse effect.
15487,"Together, these studies in the feline animal model have provided critical data on efficacy and safety of drug administration directly into the CNS that will be important for advancing HPβCD into clinical trials."
15488,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and CD4(+) T cells form the core immunopathogenic cascade leading to chronic inflammation."
15489,"Traditionally, Th1 cells (interferon-γ-producing CD4(+) T cells) driven by interleukin 12 (IL12) were considered to be the encephalitogenic T cells in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS."
15490,"Currently, Th17 cells (Il17-producing CD4(+) T cells) are considered to play a fundamental role in the immunopathogenesis of EAE."
15491,This paper highlights the growing evidence that Th17 cells play the core role in the complex adaptive immunity of EAE/MS and discusses the roles of the associated immune cells and cytokines.
15492,These constitute the modern immunological basis for the development of novel clinical and preclinical immunomodulatory therapies for MS discussed in this paper.
15493,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) can infect humans and multiple species of animals, causing a wide spectrum of diseases."
15494,"The coronavirus main protease (M(pro)), which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication through the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins, is an attractive target for anti-CoV drug design."
15495,"In this study, the crystal structures of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) M(pro) and a severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) M(pro) mutant (H41A), in complex with an N-terminal autocleavage substrate, were individually determined to elucidate the structural flexibility and substrate binding of M(pro)."
15496,A monomeric form of IBV M(pro) was identified for the first time in CoV M(pro) structures.
15497,"A comparison of these two structures to other available M(pro) structures provides new insights for the design of substrate-based inhibitors targeting CoV M(pro)s. Furthermore, a Michael acceptor inhibitor (named N3) was cocrystallized with IBV M(pro) and was found to demonstrate in vitro inactivation of IBV M(pro) and potent antiviral activity against IBV in chicken embryos."
15498,This provides a feasible animal model for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoV-associated diseases.
15499,"The structure-based optimization of N3 has yielded two more efficacious lead compounds, N27 and H16, with potent inhibition against SARS-CoV M(pro)."
15500," As the 21st century unfolds, strategies to prevent and control infectious diseases remain an area of vital interest and concern."
15501,"The burden of disease, disability, and death caused by infectious diseases is felt around the world in both developed and developing nations."
15502,"Moreover, the ability of infectious agents to destabilize populations, economies, and governments is strikingly apparent."
15503,"To an unprecedented degree, infectious disease-related issues are high on the agendas of world leaders, philanthropists, policymakers, and the public."
15504,"This enhanced focus, combined with recent scientific and technological advances, creates new opportunities and challenges for infectious disease research and practice."
15505,"This paper examines these issues in the context of three countries: China, India, and the United States."
15506,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in several high health risk populations, including infants, elderly and immunocompromised individuals."
15507,Mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with lower respiratory tract RSV infection can exceed 80%.
15508,"It has been shown that RSV replication in immunosuppressed individuals is significantly prolonged, but the contribution of pulmonary damage, if any, to the pathogenesis of RSV disease in this susceptible population is not known."
15509,"In this work, we tested RI-002, a novel standardized Ig formulation containing a high level of RSV-neutralizing Ab, for its ability to control RSV infection in immunocompromised cotton rats Sigmodon hispidus."
15510,Animals immunosuppressed by repeat cyclophosphamide injections were infected with RSV and treated with RI-002.
15511,"Prolonged RSV replication, characteristic of immunosuppressed cotton rats, was inhibited by RI-002 administration."
15512,Ab treatment reduced detection of systemic dissemination of viral RNA.
15513,"Importantly, pulmonary interstitial inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia that were significantly elevated in immunosuppressed animals were reduced by RI-002 administration."
15514,"These results indicate the potential of RI-002 to improve outcome of RSV infection in immunocompromised subjects not only by controlling viral replication, but also by reducing damage to lung parenchyma and epithelial airway lining, but further studies are needed."
15515,Antisense antimicrobial therapeutics are synthetic oligomers that silence expression of specific genes.
15516,This specificity confers an advantage over broad-spectrum antibiotics by avoiding unintended effects on commensal bacteria.
15517,The sequence-specificity and short length of antisense antimicrobials also pose little risk to human gene expression.
15518,"Because antisense antimicrobials are a platform technology, they can be rapidly designed and synthesized to target almost any microbe."
15519,"This reduces drug discovery time, and provides flexibility and a rational approach to drug development."
15520,"Recent work has shown that antisense technology has the potential to address the antibiotic-resistance crisis, since resistance mechanisms for standard antibiotics apparently have no effect on antisense antimicrobials."
15521,"Here, we describe current reports of antisense antimicrobials targeted against viruses, parasites, and bacteria."
15522," Aim The metabolism of Epimedium-derived flavonoid glycosides (EF, with icariin as the main component) in rabbit intestinal flora and its inhibition by gluconolactone were investigated in this paper to help reveal the metabolic pathway of EF in rabbits and to identify the in vivo bioactive components of EF in the prevention of steroid-associated osteonecrosis."
15523,"Methods EF were incubated at 37 °C anaerobically with rabbit intestinal flora, and then water-saturated ethyl acetate was used for sample extraction at different time points."
15524,"Furthermore, gluconolactone was added at different concentrations (8, 12 and 16 mg·mL−1) to study its inhibition of the metabolism of EF in rabbit intestinal flora."
15525,The separation was performed on a ODS column by gradient elution with acetonitrile-water (including 0.1% formic acid respectively) as mobile phase at detection wavelength of 335 nm.
15526,"Results EF were metabolized to icariside II in 2 h, and then to icaritin when incubated for 8 h; gluconolactone showed the inhibition of EF metabolism in rabbit intestinal flora in a concentration-dependent manner."
15527,Conclusion EF were found to be metabolized rapidly by hydrolysis of rabbit intestinal flora to produce icariside II and icaritin; and the total inhibition was achieved by gluconolactone at a concentration of 16 mg·mL−1.
15528,.
15529,The benzo[b]furan derivative MU314 inhibits in vitro bone resorption as potently as β-estradiol (E2).
15530,"Here, we examined the point of action on the anti-osteoporotic effects of MU314."
15531,"MU314 (10 nM) suppressed lacunae formation by osteoclastic cells and ICI-182,780, a pure E2 antagonist, inhibited this effect."
15532,"Specifically, we ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar female rats and subcutaneously injected them with either MU314 (30 or 100 μg/kg) or E2 (100 μg/kg) over an 8-week period."
15533,"Bone mineral content (BMC) in the proximal end of the tibia was significantly decreased (14%) in OVX rats, and MU314 (100 μg/kg) and E2 significantly suppressed the decline in BMC."
15534,OVX rats exhibited decreased cancellous bone in the proximal end of the tibia and induced destruction of its trabecular structure.
15535,MU314 suppressed these changes.
15536,"OVX also reduced the mechanical strength of the femoral neck, which was also recovered by MU314 and E2."
15537,"E2 completely protected against OVX-induced uterine atrophy, but MU314 had no effect."
15538,These results strongly indicate that MU314 acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator.
15539," Ethnopharmacological relevance Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic, debilitating and often lethal lung disorder."
15540,"Despite the molecular mechanisms of PF are gradually clear with numerous researchers’ efforts, few effective drugs have been developed to reverse human PF or even halt the chronic progression to respiratory failure."
15541,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the main component of the medical practice used for more than 5000 years especially in China, often exerts wider action spectrum than previously attempted options in treating human diseases."
15542,"Recent data have shown the anti-fibrotic benefits of the active ingredients from TCM in this field, which may represent an attractive source of the drug discovery against PF."
15543,"Aim of the review This review summarizes the pre-clinical and clinical evidence on the benefits of TCM and their active ingredients, and provides a comprehensive information and reliable basis for the exploration of new treatment strategies of botanical drugs in the therapy of PF."
15544,"Methods The literature information was obtained from the scientific databases on ethnobotany and ethno medicines (up to Aug 2016), mainly from the Pubmed, Web of Science and CNKI databases, and was to identify the experimental studies on the anti-fibrotic role of the active agents from TCM and the involved mechanisms."
15545,"The search keywords for such work included: “lung fibrosis” or “pulmonary fibrosis”, and “traditional Chinese medicine”, “extract” or “herb”."
15546,"Results A number of studies have shown that the active agents of single herbs and TCM formulas, particularly the flavonoids, glycosides and alkaloids, exhibit potential benefits against PF, the mechanisms of which appear to involve the regulation of inflammation, oxidant stress, and pro-fibrotic signaling pathways, etc."
15547,"Besides, the processing methods for discovering TCM in treating PF were prospectively discussed."
15548,Conclusion These research work have shown the therapeutic benefits of TCM in the treatment of PF.
15549,"However, more continued researches should be undertaken to clarify the unconfirmed chemical composition and regulatory mechanisms, conduct standard clinical trials, and evaluate the possible side effects."
15550,The insights provided in present review will be needed for further exploration of botanical drugs in the development of PF therapy.
15551,"Intracellular pathogenic microorganisms and toxins exploit host cell mechanisms to enter, exert their deleterious effects as well as hijack host nutrition for their development."
15552,A potential approach to treat multiple pathogen infections and that should not induce drug resistance is the use of small molecules that target host components.
15553,We identified the compound 1-adamantyl (5-bromo-2-methoxybenzyl) amine (ABMA) from a cell-based high throughput screening for its capacity to protect human cells and mice against ricin toxin without toxicity.
15554,"This compound efficiently protects cells against various toxins and pathogens including viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasite."
15555,"ABMA provokes Rab7-positive late endosomal compartment accumulation in mammalian cells without affecting other organelles (early endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus)."
15556,"As the mechanism of action of ABMA is restricted to host-endosomal compartments, it reduces cell infection by pathogens that depend on this pathway to invade cells."
15557,ABMA may represent a novel class of broad-spectrum compounds with therapeutic potential against diverse severe infectious diseases.
15558, The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of intravenous administration of newly fabricated nanocontainers (NCs) on the last third of pregnancy in rats.
15559,Fifteen pregnant 3-month-old Wistar rats were separated into 3 groups.
15560,"On the 15th and 17th day of pregnancy all animals received an intravenous administration of 1 ml of 15 mg of NCs (Group A), 1 ml of 5 mg NCs (Group B) while Control group received 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl."
15561,"On the 14th and 17th of pregnancy ultrasonography was performed and the parameters evaluated were the width of placenta, the length and width of the embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate."
15562,On parturition the number of pups per dam was evaluated.
15563,Half of the pups were euthanised the day after parturition and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated and for the rest of the pups the body growth curve was evaluated until the age of 14 week.
15564,At the end of the 14th week the remaining pups were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated.
15565,At weaning the dams were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated.
15566,"Ultrasonography: Baseline measurements of the width of placenta, the length and width of embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate on the 14th day of pregnancy, revealed no statistical significant differences between groups."
15567,Comparison of the same values on the 17th day of pregnancy after 2 intravenous administrations of NCs showed no statistical significant effect on the respective parameters.
15568,The administration of NCs had no impact on the mean number of pups per dam.
15569,"Additionally, no impact of the NCs on the body weights of the pups was observed on the 1st day after parturition."
15570,"Moreover, comparisons between groups, for both sexes showed no difference on growth rate."
15571,"During the histological evaluation no inflammatory, degenerative or neoplastic lesions were observed as far as the newborn, adult offspring and dams were concerned."
15572,According to our results no toxic impact of the low and high doses of the NCs was observed on the parameters selected to be evaluated.
15573, Ethnopharmacological relevance Leaf of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br.
15574,"(Apocynaceae), a wide used ethic-medicine in many Asia and Africa counties, has also been recorded as the common traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of illnesses in respiratory system by Dai people."
15575,Aim of the study To provide experimental data of clinical adaption of total indole alkaloids (TA) from leaf of A. scholaris for treating post-infectious cough in phase II clinical trial.
15576,"Materials and methods To model post-infectious cough, all animals except control group were instilled intra-tracheal with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (80 μg/50 µL/mouse), followed by subsequent exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) for 30 min per day for a total of 30 days."
15577,"Mice were orally given TA at dose of 10, 25, 50 mg/kg, and four main alkaloids (Sch: scholaricine, Epi: 19-epischolaricine, Val: vallesamine, Pic: picrinine) once daily."
15578,Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF).
15579,"Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum was determined, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and homogenate were examined."
15580,"Finally, histopathological examination in the lungs was assessed by H. E. staining."
15581,"Results After administration of TA and four major alkaloids respectively, the symptoms of cough in mice were obviously attenuated."
15582,Total white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NEU) amounts in BALF were reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated.
15583,"There was also significant reduction in IL-6, CRP, MDA and a marked improvement in SOD."
15584,"Conclusions The efficacy of indole alkaloids against post-infectious cough (PIC) was shown in the down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and the balance of antioxidants."
15585,"What's more, the pharmacological effects of TA were better than single indole alkaloid, which might be related to the synergic effect of four major alkaloids."
15586,: Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children < 5 years globally and the parasite genus Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of that diarrhea.
15587,"The global disease burden attributable to cryptosporidiosis is substantial and the only approved chemotherapeutic, nitazoxanide, has poor efficacy in HIV positive children."
15588,"Chemotherapeutic development is dependent on the calf model of cryptosporidiosis, which is the best approximation of human disease."
15589,"However, the model is not consistently applied across research studies."
15590,"Data collection commonly occurs using two different methods: Complete Fecal Collection (CFC), which requires use of confinement housing, and Interval Collection (IC), which permits use of box stalls."
15591,CFC mimics human challenge model methodology but it is unknown if confinement housing impacts study end-points and if data gathered via this method is suitable for generalization to human populations.
15592,METHODS: Using a modified crossover study design we compared CFC and IC and evaluated the impact of housing on study end-points.
15593,"At birth, calves were randomly assigned to confinement (n = 14) or box stall housing (n = 9), or were challenged with 5 x 10(7) C. parvum oocysts, and followed for 10 days."
15594,"Study end-points included fecal oocyst shedding, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and plasma cortisol."
15595,"FINDINGS: Calves in confinement had no significant differences in mean log oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter between CFC and IC samples (P = 0.6), nor were there diurnal variations in oocyst shedding (P = 0.1)."
15596,"Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001), and required more supportive care (P = 0.0009) than calves in box stalls."
15597,CONCLUSION: Housing method confounds study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis.
15598,Due to increased stress data collected from calves in confinement housing may not accurately estimate the efficacy of chemotherapeutics targeting C. parvum.
15599,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to examine the causes, pathophysiology and experimental models of non-infectious pharyngitis (sore throat)."
15600,": The causes of sore throat can be infectious (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) or non-infectious, although the relative proportion of each is not well documented."
15601,METHODS: A PubMed database search was performed for studies of non-infectious sore throat.
15602,"RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Non-infectious causes of sore throat include: physico-chemical factors, such as smoking, snoring, shouting, tracheal intubation, medications, or concomitant illness; and environmental factors including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, temperature and humidity, and hazardous or occupational irritants."
15603,"The pathophysiology underlying non-infectious sore throat is largely uncharacterised, although neurogenic inflammation looks to be a promising candidate."
15604,It is likely that there will be individual disposition factors or the coincidence of more than one irritant with possible—up to now unknown—interactions between them.
15605,"Therefore, experimental models with defined conditions and objective endpoints are needed."
15606,"A new model using cold dry air to directly induce pharyngeal irritation in humans, with pharyngeal lavage to measure biomarkers, may provide a useful tool for the study of mechanisms and treatment of non-infectious sore throat."
15607,The health of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems is inextricably linked to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).
15608,"Physiologically speaking, a balance between the vasodeleterious (ACE/Ang II/AT(1)R) and vasoprotective (ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MasR) components of the RAS is critical for cardiopulmonary homeostasis."
15609,"Upregulation of the ACE/Ang II/AT(1)R axis shifts the system toward vasoconstriction, proliferation, hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis, all factors that contribute to the development and progression of cardiopulmonary diseases."
15610,"Conversely, stimulation of the vasoprotective ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis produces a counter-regulatory response that promotes cardiovascular health."
15611,"Current research is investigating novel strategies to augment actions of the vasoprotective RAS components, particularly ACE2, in order to treat various pathologies."
15612,"While multiple approaches to increase the activity of ACE2 have displayed beneficial effects against experimental disease models, the mechanisms behind its protective actions remain incompletely understood."
15613,"Recent work demonstrating a non-catalytic role for ACE2 in amino acid transport in the gut has led us to speculate that the therapeutic effects of ACE2 can be mediated, in part, by its actions on the gastrointestinal tract and/or gut microbiome."
15614,This is consistent with emerging data which suggests that dysbiosis of the gut and lung microbiomes is associated with cardiopulmonary disease.
15615,"This review highlights new developments in the protective actions of ACE2 against cardiopulmonary disorders, discusses innovative approaches to targeting ACE2 for therapy, and explores an evolving role for gut and lung microbiota in cardiopulmonary health."
15616," In our previous study, lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro."
15617,"To determine whether lycorine has an anti-tumor effect in vivo, a series of experiments were carried out in this study."
15618,HL-60 cells (5×106) were inoculated i.v.
15619,into severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice after these mice had been irradiated (total body receiving 200cGy χ irradiation).
15620,"Treatment was given once a day from day 2 to 6, and from day 14 to 18."
15621,Lycorine (5 or 10mg/kg/day i.p.)
15622,"was found to decrease the percentages of immature granular leukocytes and of monocytes among the peripheral blood cells, and the mean survival time of both lycorine-treated groups was longer than that of the control group."
15623,Compared with the asynchronous and cytosine arabinoside- (Ara-C) treated (20mg/kg/day i.p.)
15624,"group, treatment with lycorine was more effective."
15625,"Lycorine was also found to alleviate the infiltration of tumor cells into the liver, bone, and marrow."
15626,"When SCID mice inoculated with HL-60 cells were then treated with lycorine, no severe adverse effects were observed."
15627,"This study revealed that lycorine, when tested in the human leukemia xenograft models, appears to exhibit anti-tumor activity in vivo and is a useful therapy against acute promyelocytic leukemia."
15628,"Cryptosporidiosis, caused by the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, is a moderate-to-severe diarrheal disease now recognized as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in livestock globally, and in humans living in resource-limited parts of the world, particularly those with AIDS or malnourished individuals."
15629,This recognition has fueled efforts for the discovery of effective therapeutics.
15630,"While recent progress in drug discovery has been encouraging, there are presently no acceptably effective parasite-specific drugs for the disease."
15631,The urgent need for new drug discovery or drug repurposing has also increased the need for refined animal models of clinical disease for therapeutic efficacy evaluation.
15632,"Here, we describe an acute model of cryptosporidiosis using newborn calves to evaluate well-defined clinical and parasitological parameter outcomes, including the effect on diarrhea severity and duration, oocyst numbers produced, and multiple measures of clinical health."
15633,The model is highly reproducible and provides unequivocal direct measures of treatment efficacy on diarrhea severity and parasite replication.
15634,"Griffithsin (GRFT), a lectin from Griffithsia species, inhibits human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication at sub-nanomolar concentrations, with limited cellular toxicity."
15635,"However, in vivo safety of GRFT is not fully understood, especially following parenteral administration."
15636,"We first assessed GRFT’s effects in vitro, on mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cell (mPBMC) viability, mitogenicity, and activation using flow-cytometry, as well as cytokine secretion through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
15637,Toxicological properties of GRFT were determined after a single subcutaneous administration of 50 mg/kg or 14 daily doses of 10 mg/kg in BALB/c mice.
15638,"In the context of microbicide development, toxicity of GRFT at 2 mg/kg was determined after subcutaneous, intravaginal, and intraperitoneal administrations, respectively."
15639,"Interestingly, GRFT caused no significant cell death, mitogenicity, activation, or cytokine release in mPBMCs, validating the usefulness of a mouse model."
15640,"An excellent safety profile for GRFT was obtained in vivo: no overt changes were observed in animal fitness, blood chemistry or CBC parameters."
15641,"Following GRFT treatment, reversible splenomegaly was observed with activation of certain spleen B and T cells."
15642,"However, spleen tissues were not pathologically altered by GRFT (either with a single high dose or chronic doses)."
15643,"Finally, no detectable toxicity was found after mucosal or systemic treatment with 2 mg/kg GRFT, which should be further developed as a microbicide for HIV prevention."
15644,"A 1,7-bis(alkylamino)diazachrysene-based small molecule was previously identified as an inhibitor of the botulinum neurotoxin serotype A light chain metalloprotease."
15645,"Subsequently, a variety of derivatives of this chemotype were synthesized to develop structure-activity relationships, and all are inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC."
15646,"Three-dimensional analyses indicated that half of the originally discovered 1,7-DAAC structure superimposed well with 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline-based antimalarial agents."
15647,"This observation led to the discovery that several of the 1,7-DAAC derivatives are potent in vitro inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum, and in general, are more efficacious against CQ-resistant strains than against CQ-susceptible strains."
15648,"In addition, by inhibiting β-hematin formation, the most efficacious 1,7-DAAC-based antimalarials employ a mechanism of action analogous to that of 4,7-ACQ-based antimalarials, and are well tolerated by normal cells."
15649,One candidate was also effective when administered orally in a rodent-based malaria model.
15650,"Finally, the 1,7-DAAC-based derivatives were examined for Ebola filovirus inhibition in an assay employing Vero76 cells, and three provided promising antiviral activities and acceptably low toxicities."
15651,Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with a variety of presentations and unclear pathogenesis.
15652,Multiple sclerosis has been associated with the term autoimmunity as a surrogate for pathogenesis.
15653,Multiple sclerosis is an organ-specific disease with immune-mediated myelin destruction.
15654,Understanding the complex etiology of multiple sclerosis and the importance of axon integrity is critical for clinicians who treat the disease.
15655,This review discusses the immune and autoimmune aspects of multiple sclerosis based on the current published data and novel evidence of strategies that promote remyelination and protect axons.
15656,: The antiparasitic agent niclosamide has been demonstrated to inhibit the arthropod-borne Zika virus.
15657,"Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo."
15658,"PRINCIPLE FINDING: Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21)."
15659,Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response.
15660,"Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression."
15661,"Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection."
15662,"Similar to the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication."
15663,"Co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partially decreased viral replication, viral encephalitis, and mortality in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice."
15664,SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that niclosamide diminishes viral infection by hindering endosomal acidification.
15665,"Using the film in situ zymography (FIZ) technique, it has been demonstrated that N-[N-(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl]-agmatine (E-64) inhibits Fasciola hepatica proteolytic activity in vivo."
15666,The aim of this study was to establish the dose-response relationship of the inhibition of proteolysis as assessed by FIZ with E-64 at different dosages in a murine model of fasciolosis.
15667,Maximum effective inhibition of proteolysis was achieved at 50 mg/kg/day (87%).
15668,"Mice treated with this dose survived for a mean of 10.92 days more than untreated controls, and their ova counts and egg viability were significantly (P<0.05) lower than this latter group."
15669,"These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of E-64 not only inhibited liver proteolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner but also produced anti-fecundity and anti-embryonation effects, delaying the progression of fasciolosis."
15670,"Yet, residual proteolysis may suggest that other E-64-non-sensitive enzymes are involved, or that E-64-enzyme chemical interactions are only capable of a partial agonistic-like effect."
15671,New insights in the study of virus and host biology in the context of viral infection are made possible by the development of model systems that faithfully recapitulate the in vivo viral life cycle.
15672,"Standard tissue culture models lack critical emergent properties driven by cellular organization and in vivo–like function, whereas animal models suffer from limited susceptibility to relevant human viruses and make it difficult to perform detailed molecular manipulation and analysis."
15673,Tissue engineering techniques may enable virologists to create infection models that combine the facile manipulation and readouts of tissue culture with the virus-relevant complexity of animal models.
15674,"Here, we review the state of the art in tissue engineering and describe how tissue engineering techniques may alleviate some common shortcomings of existing models of viral infection, with a particular emphasis on hepatotropic viruses."
15675,"We then discuss possible future applications of tissue engineering to virology, including current challenges and potential solutions."
15676," Southeast Asia is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases, including those with pandemic potential."
15677,Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls.
15678,Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry.
15679,Influenza A H5N1 has had a profound effect on the poultry industry.
15680,The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex.
15681,"The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches."
15682,"These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the effect of health systems through generation of drug resistance."
15683,"Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million people residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37 500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head."
15684,"The regional challenges in control of emerging infectious diseases are formidable and range from influencing the factors that drive disease emergence, to making surveillance systems fit for purpose, and ensuring that regional governance mechanisms work effectively to improve control interventions."
15685,"Fibrosis is a final stage of many lung diseases, with no effective treatment."
15686,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor–1 (PAI-1), a primary inhibitor of tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA, respectively), plays a critical role in the development of fibrosis."
15687,"In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of an orally effective small molecule PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5275, in a model of lung fibrosis induced by transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1), the most potent and ubiquitous profibrogenic cytokine, and in human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210 cells)."
15688,"The results show that an intranasal instillation of AdTGF-β1(223/225), an adenovirus expressing constitutively active TGF-β1, increased the expression of PAI-1 and induced fibrosis in murine lung tissue."
15689,"On the other hand, treating mice with 40 mg/kg of TM5275 for 10 days, starting 4 days after the instillation of AdTGF-β1(223/225), restored the activities of uPA and tPA and almost completely blocked TGF-β1–induced lung fibrosis, as shown by collagen staining, Western blotting, and the measurement of hydroxyproline."
15690,No loss of body weight was evident under these treatment conditions with TM5275.
15691,"Furthermore, we show that TM5275 induced apoptosis in both myofibroblasts (TGF-β1–treated) and naive (TGF-β1–untreated) human lung fibroblasts, and this apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspase-3/7, the induction of p53, and the inhibition of α–smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and PAI-1 expression."
15692,Such an inhibition of fibrotic responses by TM5275 occurred even in cells pretreated with TGF-β1 for 6 hours.
15693,"Together, the results suggest that TM5275 is a relatively safe and potent antifibrotic agent, with therapeutic potential in fibrotic lung disease."
15694,International Society for Disease Surveillance Conference 2011: Building the Future of Public Health Surveillance: Building the Future of Public Health Surveillance
15695,"The field of virus discovery has burgeoned with the advent of high throughput sequencing platforms and bioinformatics programs that enable rapid identification and molecular characterization of known and novel agents, investments in global microbial surveillance that include wildlife and domestic animals as well as humans, and recognition that viruses may be implicated in chronic as well as acute diseases."
15696,"Here we review methods for viral surveillance and discovery, strategies and pitfalls in linking discoveries to disease, and identify opportunities for improvements in sequencing instrumentation and analysis, the use of social media and medical informatics that will further advance clinical medicine and public health."
15697,Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) and the striatum.
15698,"Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in limiting mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation in the central nervous system and protecting dopaminergic neurons and a promising therapeutic target for PD."
15699,"Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius, has been used in traditional medicine for its many clinical pharmacological effects, including the treatment of psychological symptoms in PD."
15700,"However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking."
15701,"Here, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced PD in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1."
15702,"CP increased the expression levels of Nurr1, tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC."
15703,"In MPTP-induced PD, CP promoted recovery from movement impairments."
15704,"CP prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 by inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and glial/microglial activation."
15705,"Moreover, CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines and response levels and glial/microglial activation in BV2 microglia and the mouse brain."
15706,"Our findings suggest that CP might contribute to neuroprotective signaling by regulating neurotrophic factors primarily via Nurr1 signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis."
15707,"Urodynamic studies, used to understand bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and develop treatments for dysfunctions, are ideally performed with awake subjects."
15708,"However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder."
15709,"This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [ΔHR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats."
15710,"Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with α-chloralose."
15711,Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively.
15712,"Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone."
15713,"Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine."
15714,These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.
15715," Ethnopharmacological relevance Cedrela serrata Royle (C. serrata) is a medicinal plant not only used for constructions but also an important conventional medicine for the treatment of various diseases such as; diabetes, jaundice, liver diseases, diarrhea, fever, chronic infantile dysentery, intestinal worms, hypertension, skin and blood diseases."
15716,"Aims This review article documents and critically assesses, for the first time; up to date categorized information about C. serrata including its reported pharmacological activities, cultural uses, active compounds, and botanical description."
15717,Materials and method s: All provided information about C. serrata was collected using the electronic databases (e.g.
15718,"Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Springer Link), books (e.g."
15719,"Trees of Pakistan and Herbalism, Phytochemistry, and Ethnopharmacology) and thesis."
15720,"Results Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical studies on C. serrata revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as; flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and cardiac glycosides."
15721,"The phytochemicals showed various in vitro activities like antioxidant, anti-infective, antiglycation, cytotoxic activities."
15722,Major areas of research conducted on C. serrata are its antioxidant and anti-infective activities.
15723,"Few historical uses of C. serrata are supported by modern in vitro pharmacological studies such as; antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, and leishmanicidal activity."
15724,"Conclusion There were convincing evidence in in vitro studies supporting C. serrata antioxidant, anti-infective, anti-diabetic, anti-glycating, and cytotoxic activities."
15725,"Nevertheless, all reported pharmacological activities were carried out in vitro and a gap in research i.e."
15726,preclinical and clinical investigation still exists.
15727,"The authors emphasize the need for future in-depth research and clinical trials to investigate C. serrata pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy and safety."
15728,The potential chemical compounds with suggestive classes may need to be isolated and pharmacological activities must be established for these compounds.
15729,The plant has very limited information about pharmacological activities and the data available for supportive cultural uses needs proper validation.
15730,The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 marked the second introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.
15731,"The continuing introductions of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels, the subsequent travel-related viral spread, the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates highlight the need for prophylactic and therapeutic measures."
15732,Scientific advancements since the 2002–2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic allowed for rapid progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the development of therapeutics.
15733,"In this Review, we detail our present understanding of the transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and discuss the current state of development of measures to combat emerging coronaviruses."
15734,"SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
15735," Halofuginone lactate (HL) is registered in several countries for the prevention of calf cryptosporidiosis, but the compound's utility in the presence of co-infection with other enteropathogens is not well understood."
15736,"We performed a randomized controlled field trial of the efficacy of HL for the prevention of natural calf cryptosporidiosis, in the presence of co-infection with rotavirus and Salmonella Typhimurium."
15737,"Newborn calves on one farm were sequentially enrolled and allocated to a full dose (n =15), half dose (n =15), or a placebo control group (n =15), using a randomized block design."
15738,"The Cryptosporidium oocysts in fecal specimens collected on Days 6, 8, 10, 14 and 20 were counted and the severity of the diarrhea was assessed using fecal consistency scores (solid, semisolid, or liquid)."
15739,The oocyst numbers and fecal consistency scores were statistically compared between the groups.
15740,Ninety one percent of the calves shed Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts during the trial.
15741,"The full dose group had a longer prepatent period than the control group, but no statistical difference in the number of oocysts was identified between the groups after controlling for the effects of sex and breed."
15742,The fecal consistency scores and mortality rates did not differ between the groups.
15743,These results indicated that the anti-Cryptosporidium activity and clinical benefit of HL were limited.
15744,"It is concluded that in order to maximize the clinical efficacy of HL in the field, diagnostic efforts should aim to rule out the presence of other enteropathogens."
15745,"Bacteriophage (phage), which are viruses that infect bacteria only, have shown promise as vehicles for targeted cancer gene therapy, albeit with poor efficiency."
15746,"Recently, we generated an improved version of phage vectors by incorporating cis genetic elements of adeno‐associated virus (AAV)."
15747,This novel AAV/phage hybrid (AAVP) efficiently delivered systemically administered therapeutic genes to various tumor targets by displaying an integrin tumor‐targeting ligand on the phage capsid.
15748,"However, inherent limitations in bacteriophage mean that these AAVP vectors still need to be improved."
15749,One of the limitations of AAVP in mammalian cells may be its susceptibility to proteasomal degradation.
15750,The proteasome is upregulated in cancer and it is known that it constitutes a barrier to gene delivery by certain eukaryotic viruses.
15751,We report here that inhibition of proteasome improved targeted reporter gene delivery by AAVP in cancer cells in vitro and in tumors in vivo after intravenous vector administration to tumor‐bearing mice.
15752,We also show enhanced targeted tumor cell killing by AAVP upon proteasome inhibition.
15753,"The AAVP particles persisted significantly in cancer cells in vitro and in tumors in vivo after systemic administration, and accumulated polyubiquitinated coat proteins."
15754,Our results suggest that the proteasome is indeed a barrier to tumor targeting by AAVP and indicate that a combination of proteasome‐inhibiting drugs and AAVP should be considered for clinical anticancer therapy.
15755,The scientific basis of multiple sclerosis
15756, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which involves a complex interaction between immune system and neural cells.
15757,Animal modeling has been critical for addressing MS pathogenesis.
15758,"The three most characterized animal models of MS are (1) the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE); (2) the virally-induced chronic demyelinating disease, known as Theiler׳s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and (3) the toxin-induced demyelination."
15759,"All these models, in a complementary way, have allowed to reach a good knowledge of the pathogenesis of MS."
15760,"Specifically, EAE is the model which better reflects the autoimmune pathogenesis of MS and is extremely useful to study potential experimental treatments."
15761,"Furthermore, both TMEV and toxin-induced demyelination models are suitable for characterizing the role of the axonal injury/repair and the remyelination process in MS."
15762,"In conclusion, animal models, despite their limitations, remain the most useful instrument for implementing the study of MS."
15763,The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) possesses a variety of unique features which make them desirable research models.
15764,"Despite these features, experimental use of the hamster has declined over the past 20–30 years."
15765,The current chapter will focus on research and literature describing the experimental use of the hamster with a particular emphasis on research done since the previous edition of this text (1987–present).
15766,Recent advances in host–microbe interaction studies in organoid cultures have shown great promise and have laid the foundation for much more refined future studies using these systems.
15767,Modeling of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in cerebral organoids have helped us understand its association with microcephaly.
15768,"Similarly, the pathogenesis of bacterial (Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile) and viral (Norovirus, Rotaviruses) infections have been precisely dissected in organoid cultures."
15769,"Additionally, direct associations between microbial colonization of tissues and diseases like cancer have also been deciphered."
15770,"Here we discuss the most recent and striking studies on host–microbe interactions in organoid cultures, highlighting various methods which can be used for developing microbe-organoid co-culture systems."
15771,Surgical correction of congenital cardiac malformations or aortocoronary bypass surgery in many cases implies the use of cardiopulmonary-bypass (CPB).
15772,"However, a possible negative impact of CPB on internal organs such as brain, kidney, lung and liver cannot be neglected."
15773,"In general, CPB initiates a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) which is presumably caused by contact of blood components with the surface of CPB tubing."
15774,"Moreover, during CPB the heart typically undergoes a period of cold ischemia, and the other peripheral organs a global low flow hypoperfusion."
15775,"As a result, a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines is released activating different biochemical pathways, which finally may result in the occurrence of microthrombosis, microemboli, in depletion of coagulation factors and haemorrhagic diathesis besides typical ischemia-reperfusion injuries."
15776,"In our review we will focus on possible pharmacological interventions in patients to decrease negative effects of CPB and to improve post-operative outcome with regard to heart and other organs like brain, kidney, or lung."
15777,"In recent years a number of beneficial health effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that extend beyond lowering blood pressure, primarily mediated via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1–7) or Ang(1–7)/MAS receptor axis."
15778,"Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues."
15779,The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function.
15780,"Indeed, genetically engineered recombinant probiotics are promising treatment strategies offering delivery of therapeutic proteins with precision."
15781,"An Ang(1–7) secreting Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) or LP-A has been described for regulation of diabetes and hypertension; however, we are the first to the best of our knowledge to propose this paradigm as it relates to aging."
15782,"In this Research Practice manuscript, we provide proof of concept for using this technology in a well-characterized rodent model of aging: the Fisher344 x Brown Norway Rat (F344BN)."
15783,Our primary findings suggest that LP-A increases circulating levels of Ang(1–7) both acutely and chronically (after 8 or 28 treatment days) when administered 3× or 7×/week over 4 weeks.
15784,Our future preclinical studies will explore the impact of this treatment on gut and other age-sensitive distal tissues such as brain and muscle.
15785,"Although there is overwhelming pressure from funding agencies and the general public for scientists to bridge basic and translational studies, the fact remains that there are significant hurdles to overcome in order to achieve this goal."
15786,The purpose of this Opinion article is to examine the nature of these hurdles and to provide food for thought on the main obstacles that impede this process.
15787,"As Food is related to human survival and health, the country’s reputation and image, and the economic benefit and position in the international trade, it has become one of the hottest issues in the world now."
15788,"As the continuous growth of world population, the constant changes of human life style and the continued deterioration of natural environment, higher requests for food safety are put forward by human society."
15789,"Therefore, we should not only ensure the safety of quantity, but also to ensure the safety of quality in the food safety field by 2050."
15790,"New concepts and technological means should be adopted to ensure the constant production and supply of the “green” and safe agricultural production to meet the people’s great need for food safety, nutrition and health."
15791,Increasing research has demonstrated that expression of brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) and other circadian clock genes can be regulated by drugs and toxicants.
15792,"We previously demonstrated that icariin, extracted from Herba Epimedii, sromotes osteogenic differentiation."
15793,"However, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains unclear."
15794,The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.
15795,The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation.
15796,"The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and BMAL1 in BMSCs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting."
15797,ALP and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were also performed.
15798,"Icariin promoted BMSC proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMAL1."
15799,"In addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were upregulated by BMAL1 overexpression."
15800,"Furthermore, we confirmed that BMAL1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs."
15801,"Finally, ARS staining of BMAL1(−/−) BMSCs revealed that BMAL1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation."
15802,"In conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMAL1-BMP2 signaling in BMSCs."
15803,The present study thus described a novel target of icariin that has potential applications in the treatment of osteogenic disorders.
15804, The paradigm modifications in the metallic crystals from bulky to micro-size to nano-scale have resulted in excellent and amazing properties; which have been the remarkable interests in a wider range of applications.
15805,"Particularly, Ag NPs have much attention owing to their distinctive optical, chemical, electrical and catalytic properties that can be tuned with surface nature, size, shapes, etc."
15806,"and hence these crystals have been used in various fields such as catalysis, sensor, electronic components, antimicrobial agents in the health industry etc."
15807,"Among them, Ag NPs based disinfectants have paid attention due to the practical applications in our daily life."
15808,"Therefore the Ag NPs have been used in different sectors such as silver-based air/water filters, textile, animal husbandry, biomedical and food packaging etc."
15809,"In this review, the Ag NPs as a disinfectant in different sectors have been included in detail."
15810," Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are important pathogens that cause upper respiratory tract infections and have neuroinvasive abilities; however, little is known about the dynamic infection process of CoVs in vivo, and there are currently no specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat HCoV infection."
15811,"Here, we verified the replication ability and pathogenicity of a reporter HCoV-OC43 strain expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc; rOC43-ns2DelRluc) in mice with different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and BALB/c)."
15812,"Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc."
15813,"We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc."
15814,"Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS."
15815,"Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice."
15816,"Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo."
15817,"These results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial dissemination of HCoV-OC43 in the CNS, and our methods provide an extremely sensitive platform for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapies to treat neuroinvasive HCoVs in live mice."
15818,RNA interference is a promising strategy for treatment of Huntington’s disease (HD) as it can specifically decrease the expression of the mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt).
15819,"However, siRNA does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore delivery to the brain is limited to direct CNS delivery."
15820,Non-invasive delivery of siRNA through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) would be a significant advantage for translating this therapy to HD patients.
15821,"Focused ultrasound (FUS), combined with intravascular delivery of microbubble contrast agent, was used to locally and transiently disrupt the BBB in the right striatum of adult rats."
15822,"48 hrs following treatment with siRNA, the right (treated) and left (control) striatum was dissected and analyzed for Htt mRNA levels."
15823,We demonstrate that FUS can non-invasively deliver siRNA-Htt directly to the striatum leading to a significant reduction of Htt expression in a dose dependent manner.
15824,"Furthermore, we show that reduction of Htt with siRNA-Htt was greater when the extent of BBB disruption was increased."
15825,This study demonstrates that siRNA treatment for knockdown of mutant Htt is feasible without the surgical intervention previously required for direct delivery to the brain.
15826,The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been a focus of international attention since its identification in 2012.
15827,"Epidemiologically it is characterized by sporadic community cases, which are amplified by hospital-based outbreaks."
15828,"Healthcare facilities in 27 countries from most continents have experienced imported cases, with the most significant outbreak involving 186 cases in Korea."
15829,The mortality internationally is 36% and guidance for clinical management has yet to be developed.
15830,Most facilities and healthcare providers outside of the Middle East receiving patients have no or little experience in the clinical management of MERS.
15831,When a case does occur there is likely little time for a critical appraisal of the literature and putative pharmacological options.
15832,We identified published literature on the management of both MERS-CoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through searches of PubMed and WHO and the US CDC websites up to 30 April 2016.
15833,A total of 101 publications were retrieved for critical appraisal.
15834,"Most published literature on therapeutics for MERS are in vitro experiments, animal studies and case reports."
15835,Current treatment options for MERS can be categorized as: immunotherapy with virus-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma; polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced in vitro or in genetically modified animals; and antiviral agents.
15836,The use of any therapeutics in MERS-CoV remains investigational.
15837,"The therapeutic agents with potential benefits and warranting further investigation include convalescent plasma, interferon-β/ribavirin combination therapy and lopinavir."
15838,"Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid likely have toxicities that exceed potential benefits."
15839,Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM‐1) is critically involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
15840,"In contrast to cytokine blockers, therapeutic blockade of TREM‐1 can blunt excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control."
15841,"However, the nature of the TREM‐1 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM‐1 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM‐1."
15842,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti‐arthritic activity of a novel, ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that was rationally designed using the signalling chain homo oligomerization (SCHOOL) model of cell signalling."
15843,Free GF9 and GF9 bound to macrophage‐targeted nanoparticles that mimic human high‐density lipoproteins (GF9‐HDL) were used to treat collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA).
15844,"We also tested if 31‐mer peptides with sequences from GF9 and helices 4 (GE31) and 6 (GA31) of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein A‐I, are able to perform three functions: assist in the self‐assembly of GA/E31‐HDL, target these particles to macrophages and block TREM‐1 signalling."
15845,"We showed that GF9, but not control peptide, ameliorated CIA and protected against bone and cartilage damage."
15846,"The therapeutic effect of GF9 was accompanied by a reduction in the plasma levels of macrophage colony‐stimulating factor and pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor‐α, interleukin (IL)‐1 and IL‐6."
15847,Incorporation of GF9 alone or as a part of GE31 and GA31 peptides into HDL significantly increased its therapeutic efficacy.
15848,"Collectively, our findings suggest that TREM‐1 inhibitory SCHOOL sequences may be promising alternatives for the treatment of RA."
15849,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance."
15850,"Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions."
15851,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body."
15852,"The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease."
15853,"Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
15854,"ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections."
15855,"In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS."
15856,"Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury."
15857,"Indeed, increasing ACE2 activity might be a novel approach for the treatment of acute lung failure in several diseases."
15858,"ABSTRACT We determined if feeding and lying behavior, recorded by automatic calf feeding systems (ACFS) and accelerometers, could be used to detect changes in behavior before onset of neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) or in response to disbudding pain in dairy calves."
15859,"At 4 d of age, 112 calves had accelerometers attached to their hind leg and were housed in pens with ACFS."
15860,Calves were examined daily for signs of illness or injury.
15861,"Of the 112 calves monitored, 18 were diagnosed with NCD; activities of calves with NCD were then compared with those of 18 healthy controls (calves that had no symptoms of NCD, other illnesses, or injury)."
15862,Feeding (milk consumption and the number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder) and lying behavior during the 5 d leading up to calves displaying clinical signs of NCD were analyzed.
15863,"Calves with NCD performed fewer unrewarded visits and consumed less milk than healthy calves during the 2- and 4-d periods before diagnosis with NCD, respectively."
15864,Calves with NCD tended to perform fewer lying bouts than healthy calves over the 5-d period before diagnosis with NCD.
15865,"At 3 wk of age, a subset of 51 healthy calves were allocated to 1 of 5 treatment groups: (1) sham handling (SHAM, n = 10), (2) cautery disbudding (DB, n = 11), (3) administration of local anesthetic (LA) and DB (LA+DB, n = 11), 4) administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and DB (NSAID+DB, n = 9), and (5) administration of LA, NSAID and DB (LA+NSAID+DB, n = 10)."
15866,Feeding and lying behavior were recorded continuously for 24 h pre- and postdisbudding.
15867,We found no effect of treatment on the number of rewarded or unrewarded visits to the feeder and milk volume consumed 24 h before administration of treatments.
15868,"During the 24-h postdisbudding period, SHAM calves performed more unrewarded visits than DB, LA+DB, and NSAID+DB calves, but the number of unrewarded visits did not differ between SHAM and LA+NSAID+DB calves."
15869,"During the first hour of the posttreatment period we noted a difference in lying times among treatments, with DB and NSAID+DB calves spending less time lying than SHAM calves and lying times being similar between SHAM, LA+DB, and LA+NSAID+DB calves."
15870,The ACFS and accelerometers have the potential to automatically gather valuable information regarding health status and pain in calves.
15871,"Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine both of these measures (ACFS and accelerometers) when evaluating NCD on farm or pain in calves in future research."
15872," Mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) is a representative member of the genus betacoronavirus within the subfamily Coronavirinae, which infects the liver, brain and respiratory tract."
15873,"Through different inoculation routes, MHV-A59 can provide animal models for encephalitis, hepatitis and pneumonia to explore viral life machinery and virus-host interactions."
15874,"In viral replication, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5), also termed main protease (Mpro), plays a dominant role in processing coronavirus-encoded polyproteins and is thus recognized as an ideal target of anti-coronavirus agents."
15875,"However, no structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro has been reported, and molecular exploration of the catalysis mechanism remains hindered."
15876,"Here, we solved the crystal structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro complexed with a Michael acceptor-based inhibitor, N3."
15877,"Structural analysis revealed that the Cβ of the vinyl group of N3 covalently bound to C145 of the catalytic dyad of Mpro, which irreversibly inactivated cysteine protease activity."
15878,"The lactam ring of the P1 side chain and the isobutyl group of the P2 side chain, which mimic the conserved residues at the same positions of the substrate, fit well into the S1 and S2 pockets."
15879,"Through a comparative study with Mpro of other coronaviruses, we observed that the substrate-recognition pocket and enzyme inhibitory mechanism is highly conservative."
15880,"Altogether, our study provided structural features of MHV-A59 Mpro and indicated that a Michael acceptor inhibitor is an ideal scaffold for antiviral drugs."
15881,"The Great East Japan Earthquakes of March 11, 2011 caused immense harm to the community and subsequent nuclear accident in Fukushima Prefecture extended the damage."
15882,Local residents were forced to evacuated without pets and the left behind animals were rescued from the restricted zone one month later.
15883,Unplanned animal rescue and unregulated sheltering caused secondary damage to animals such as disease epidemics at impounded animal shelter.
15884,"The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of upper respiratory infection (URI) and diarrhea in cats at the first response animal shelter in Fukushima, and investigate factors affecting the duration of disease and determinants of treatments performed."
15885,"Eighty percent and 59% of impounded cats developed URI, 71% and 54% of cats developed diarrhea, and 91% and 83% of cats had at least one disease in 2011 and 2012, respectively."
15886,Uses of multiple drug administration (more than five drugs) was associated with prolonged URI and diarrhea.
15887,"Multiple antibiotics, antihistamines, interferon, and steroids were associated with relapse of and prolonged URI."
15888,"Developing a standardized treatment protocol for commonly observed diseases at Japanese animal shelters to prevent and control diseases, to promote animal welfare, and protect public health in the face of future disasters is overdue."
15889,Rationale: Cardiac stem cell-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to promote cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction in preclinical studies.
15890,Recent studies have used intramyocardial injection in order to concentrate exosomes in the infarct.
15891,"Though effective in a research setting, this method is not clinically appealing due to its invasive nature."
15892,"We propose the use of a targeting peptide, cardiac homing peptide (CHP), to target intravenously-infused exosomes to the infarcted heart."
15893,Methods: Exosomes were conjugated with CHP through a DOPE-NHS linker.
15894,Ex vivo targeting was analyzed by incubating organ sections with the CHP exosomes and analyzing with fluorescence microscopy.
15895,In vitro assays were performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells.
15896,"For the animal study, we utilized an ischemia/reperfusion rat model."
15897,"Animals were treated with either saline, scramble peptide exosomes, or CHP exosomes 24 h after surgery."
15898,Echocardiography was performed 4 h after surgery and 21 d after surgery.
15899,"At 21 d, animals were sacrificed, and organs were collected for analysis."
15900,"Results: By conjugating the exosomes with CHP, we demonstrate increased retention of the exosomes within heart sections ex vivo and in vitro with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes."
15901,"In vitro studies showed improved viability, reduced apoptosis and increased exosome uptake when using CHP-XOs."
15902,"Using an animal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we measured the heart function, infarct size, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, with improved outcomes with the CHP exosomes."
15903,Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a novel method for increasing delivery of for treatment of myocardial infarction.
15904,"By targeting exosomes to the infarcted heart, there was a significant improvement in outcomes with reduced fibrosis and scar size, and increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis."
15905,Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are either highly prevalent or increasing rapidly in Hong Kong and China.
15906,"Treatment options for these bacteria are generally limited, less effective and more expensive."
15907,"The emergence and dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria circulating between animals, the environment and humans are not entirely known."
15908,"Nonetheless, selective pressure by antibiotics on the microbiomes of animal and human, and their associated environments (especially farms and healthcare institutions), sewage systems and soil are likely to confer survival advantages upon bacteria with antimicrobial-resistance genes, which may be further disseminated through plasmids or transposons with integrons."
15909,"Therefore, antibiotic use must be tightly regulated to eliminate such selective pressure, including the illegalization of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed and regulation of antibiotic use in veterinary practice and human medicine."
15910,"Heightened awareness of infection control measures to reduce the risk of acquiring resistant bacteria is essential, especially during antimicrobial use or institutionalization in healthcare facilities."
15911,"The transmission cycle must be interrupted by proper hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, avoidance of undercooked or raw food and compliance with infection control measures by healthcare workers, visitors and patients, especially during treatment with antibiotics."
15912,"In addition to these routine measures, proactive microbiological screening of hospitalized patients with risk factors for carrying resistant bacteria, including history of travel to endemic countries, transfer from other hospitals, and prolonged hospitalization; directly observed hand hygiene before oral intake of drugs, food and drinks; and targeted disinfection of high-touch or mutual-touch items, such as bed rails and bed curtains, are important."
15913,Transparency of surveillance data from each institute for public scrutiny provides an incentive for controlling antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings at an administrative level.
15914,Amentoflavone (C(30)H(18)O(10)) is a well-known biflavonoid occurring in many natural plants.
15915,"This polyphenolic compound has been discovered to have some important bioactivities, including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-diabetes, and anti-senescence effects on many important reactions in the cardiovascular and central nervous system, etc."
15916,"Over 120 plants have been found to contain this bioactive component, such as Selaginellaceae, Cupressaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Calophyllaceae plant families."
15917,"This review paper aims to profile amentoflavone on its plant sources, natural derivatives, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics, and to highlight some existing issues and perspectives in the future."
15918, Ethnopharmacological relevance Bai-Hu-Tang (BHT) was traditionally used to reduce fever heat and promote generation of body fluids.
15919,Aim of the study To investigate the effect and mechanism of BHT in the prevention of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fever in manners of immune modulation.
15920,Materials and methods The model of fever syndrome of Chinese medicine pattern was imitated by LPS injection i.v.
15921,"in rabbits, and BHT was gavaged."
15922,"The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-6, 10) and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested by biochemical methods."
15923,Liver tissue damage was detected by hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) stain.
15924,Subpopulation of T cells was detected by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS).
15925,Genes expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in liver tissue were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
15926,"Result The results demonstrated that BHT prevented sudden increase of IL-10, TNF-α, ALT and AST, and liver damage induced by LPS."
15927,BHT also prevented significant decrease of the percentage of CD8+ T cells since LPS injection.
15928,"At the same time, BHT did not affect the gene expression of TLR4 and serum concentration of three immunoglobulins, which were increased by LPS, but made gene expression of LBP higher."
15929,Conclusion The results of this study indicated that BHT played an important role in immunity protection and anti-injury through preventing immunoinflammatory damage by LPS.
15930,"The achievement thereby scientifically provided mechanism of BHT in the prevention of febrile disease, and supported its traditional use."
15931," Coronaviruses may cause respiratory, enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species, including humans."
15932,"Until recently, the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses hampered development of coronavirus specific therapeutics."
15933,"However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has prompted the discovery of such drugs."
15934,"Subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated the efficacy of SARS-CoV specific monoclonal antibodies, pegylated-interferon-α and siRNAs against SARS-CoV."
15935,"Furthermore, several antivirals shown to be effective against other viruses were tested in vitro."
15936,"Because of availability and shown efficacy, the use of interferons may be considered should SARS-CoV or a related coronavirus (re)-emerge."
15937,The more recent design of wide-spectrum inhibitors targeting the coronavirus main proteases may lead to the discovery of new antivirals against multiple coronavirus induced diseases.
15938,Background: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor prevalent in adolescents with poor prognosis.
15939,"Toona sinensis showed potent antiproliferation effect on lung, melatonin, ovary, colon, and liver cancers."
15940,"However, the effects of the species on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated."
15941,"Results: In this study, we found fraction 1 of Toona sinensis leaf (TSL-1) resulted in inhibition of cell viability in MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines, while it only caused a moderate suppressive effect on normal osteoblasts."
15942,"In addition, TSL-1 significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase leakage and induced apoptosis and necrosis in Saos-2 cells."
15943,TSL-1 increased mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bad.
15944,"Most important, TSL-1 significantly suppressed Saos-2 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice by increasing caspase-3."
15945,The IC-50 of TSL-1 for the 3 tested osteosarcoma cells is around 1/9 of that for lung cancer cells.
15946,"Conclusion: We demonstrated that TSL-1, a fractionated extract from TSL, caused significant cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells due to apoptosis."
15947,In vivo xenograft study showed that TSL-1 suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells at least in part by inducing apoptosis.
15948,Our results indicate that TSL-1 has potential to be a promising anti-osteosarcoma adjuvant functional plant extract.
15949,"“We can talk endlessly about moral progress, about social progress, about poetic progress, about progress made in happiness; nevertheless, there is a type of progress that defies any discussion, and that is scientific progress, as soon as we judge it within the hierarchy of knowledge, from a specifically intellectual point of view.”"
15950,"In chronic HCV infection, treatment failure and defective host immune response highly demand improved therapy strategies."
15951,Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells may inhibit HCV replication in vitro through IFN-γ release after Phosphoantigen (PhAg) stimulation.
15952,"The aim of our work was to analyze Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell functionality during chronic HCV infection, studying the role of IFN-α on their function capability."
15953,IFN-γ production by Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells was analyzed in vitro in 24 HCV-infected patients and 35 healthy donors (HD) after PhAg stimulation with or without IFN-α.
15954,The effect of in vivo PhAg/IFN-α administration on plasma IFN-γ levels was analyzed in M. fascicularis monkeys.
15955,A quantitative analysis of IFN-γ mRNA level and stability in Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells was also evaluated.
15956,"During chronic HCV infection, Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells showed an effector/activated phenotype and were significantly impaired in IFN-γ production."
15957,"Interestingly, IFN-α was able to improve their IFN-γ response to PhAg both in vitro in HD and HCV-infected patients, and in vivo in Macaca fascicularis primates."
15958,"Finally, IFN-α increased IFN-γ-mRNA transcription and stability in PhAg-activated Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells."
15959,Altogether our results show a functional impairment of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells during chronic HCV infection that can be partially restored by using IFN-α.
15960,A study aimed to evaluate the antiviral impact of PhAg/IFN-α combination may provide new insight in designing possible combined strategies to improve HCV infection treatment outcome.
15961,Antimicrobial drugs may be used to treat diarrheal illness in companion animals.
15962,It is important to monitor antimicrobial use to better understand trends and patterns in antimicrobial resistance.
15963,There is no monitoring of antimicrobial use in companion animals in Canada.
15964,"To explore how the use of electronic medical records could contribute to the ongoing, systematic collection of antimicrobial use data in companion animals, anonymized electronic medical records were extracted from 12 participating companion animal practices and warehoused at the University of Calgary."
15965,"We used the pre-diagnostic, clinical features of diarrhea as the case definition in this study."
15966,"Using text-mining technologies, cases of diarrhea were described by each of the following variables: diagnostic laboratory tests performed, the etiological diagnosis and antimicrobial therapies."
15967,The ability of the text miner to accurately describe the cases for each of the variables was evaluated.
15968,It could not reliably classify cases in terms of diagnostic tests or etiological diagnosis; a manual review of a random sample of 500 diarrhea cases determined that 88/500 (17.6%) of the target cases underwent diagnostic testing of which 36/88 (40.9%) had an etiological diagnosis.
15969,"Text mining, compared to a human reviewer, could accurately identify cases that had been treated with antimicrobials with high sensitivity (92%, 95% confidence interval, 88.1%–95.4%) and specificity (85%, 95% confidence interval, 80.2%–89.1%)."
15970,"Overall, 7400/15,928 (46.5%) of pets presenting with diarrhea were treated with antimicrobials."
15971,Some temporal trends and patterns of the antimicrobial use are described.
15972,The results from this study suggest that informatics and the electronic medical records could be useful for monitoring trends in antimicrobial use.
15973,Cell fusion is a ubiquitous process fundamental to physiological and pathophysiological events common to multiple cell types and species.
15974,"Performed ex vivo, cell fusion is a versatile research and therapeutic tool for gene mapping, antibody production, discovering new mechanisms in biological processes, inventing alternative therapies for cell reprogramming, restoring organ function, and creating cellular therapeutics for cancer treatment."
15975,Cell fusion can be successfully applied by creating cellular therapeutic of donor – recipient chimeric cell (DRCC) in the field of solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA).
15976,"Immunomodulatory DRCC therapy has the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for toxic, life-long immunosuppression and to prevent both acute and chronic rejection."
15977,This innovative VCA treatment is a combination of ex vivo created chimeric cell therapy with a short-term selective protocol of monoclonal antibody and Cyclosporine A.
15978,"The utilization of short-term immunosuppressive protocol will provide the opportunity for chimeric cell engraftment, proliferation, and re-education of recipient’s immune system resulting in prolongation of allograft survival."
15979,"The use of chimeric cells, as a supportive treatment for VCA, would improve the conditions of severely disfigured patients by offering safe alternative approach and providing better functional and aesthetic results compared to standard reconstructive procedures."
15980,"This chapter summarizes the phenomenon, current discoveries, and advancements in the field of cell fusion, as well as introduces ex vivo creation of chimeric cells and presents potential benefits of chimeric cell-based protocols."
15981,Successful application of chimeric cell protocol in VCA experimental models will advance the field of reconstructive transplantation towards clinical trials.
15982," Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitous cellular enzyme playing critical roles in many biological processes, and its inhibitor has been reported to have potential immunosuppressive activity."
15983,"In this work, we reported a novel quinoxaline derivative, 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-6-(3-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-piperidino)carbonylamino quinoxaline (DC838, 3), which was confirmed to be a potent inhibitor against human CypA."
15984,"By using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence titration techniques, the kinetic analysis of CypA/DC838 interaction was quantitatively performed."
15985,CypA peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerase (PPIase) activity inhibition assay showed that DC838 demonstrated highly CypA PPIase inhibitory activity.
15986,In vivo assay results showed that DC838 could inhibit mouse spleen cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A (Con A).
15987,Molecular docking simulation further elucidated the specific DC838 binding to CypA at the atomic level.
15988,The current work should provide useful information in the discovery of immunosuppressor based on CypA inhibitor.
15989,"Organoids are multicellular culture systems that replicate tissue architecture and function, and are increasingly used as models of viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections."
15990,Organoids have great potential to improve our current understanding of helminth interactions with their hosts and to replace or reduce the dependence on using animal models.
15991,"In this review, we discuss the applicability of this technology to helminth infection research, including strategies of co-culture of helminths or their products with organoids and the challenges, advantages, and drawbacks of the use of organoids for these studies."
15992,We also explore how complementing organoid systems with other cell types and components may allow more complex models to be generated in the future to further investigate helminth–host interactions.

15995,Application of capsaicin solution onto the rat pharyngeal mucosa caused a well-reproducible increase in vascular permeability in the pharynx.
15996,2.
15997,2.
15998,"Capsaicin-induced pharyngeal inflammation was unaffected by a histamine H1 blocker and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, whereas dexamethasone was effective in its inhibition."
15999,3.
16000,3.
16001,"FK224, a dual antagonist of tachykinin NK1 and NK2 receptors, and FK888, a selective antagonist of NK1 receptor, significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced plasma exudation in the pharynx."
16002,4.
16003,4.
16004,"In capsaicinized animals, the application of capsaicin solution in the pharyngeal mucosa did not induce pharyngitis."
16005,5.
16006,5.
16007,These results suggest that the mechanism of the capsaicin-induced pharyngitis primarily involves tachykinins.
16008,"Aptamers are short, single-stranded DNA, RNA, or synthetic XNA molecules that can be developed with high affinity and specificity to interact with any desired targets."
16009,"They have been widely used in facilitating discoveries in basic research, ensuring food safety and monitoring the environment."
16010,"Furthermore, aptamers play promising roles as clinical diagnostics and therapeutic agents."
16011,"This review provides update on the recent advances in this rapidly progressing field of research with particular emphasis on generation of aptamers and their applications in biosensing, biotechnology and medicine."
16012,The limitations and future directions of aptamers in target specific delivery and real-time detection are also discussed.
16013," Among the many medical applications of systems biology, we contend that infectious disease is one of the most important and tractable targets."
16014,"We take the view that the complexity of the immune system is an inevitable consequence of its evolution, and this complexity has frustrated reductionist efforts to develop host-directed therapies for infection."
16015,"However, since hosts vary widely in susceptibility and tolerance to infection, host-directed therapies are likely to be effective, by altering the biology of a susceptible host to induce a response more similar to a host who survives."
16016,"Such therapies should exert minimal selection pressure on organisms, thus greatly decreasing the probability of pathogen resistance developing."
16017,"A systems medicine approach to infection has the potential to provide new solutions to old problems: to identify host traits that are potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention, and the host immune factors that could be targeted by host-directed therapies."
16018,"Furthermore, undiscovered sub-groups with different responses to treatment are almost certain to exist among patients presenting with life-threatening infection, since this population is markedly clinically heterogeneous."
16019,"A major driving force behind high-throughput clinical phenotyping studies is the aspiration that these subgroups, hitherto opaque to observation, may be observed in the data generated by new technologies."
16020,"Subgroups of patients are unlikely to be static – serial clinical and biological phenotyping may reveal different trajectories through the pathophysiology of disease, in which different therapeutic approaches are required."
16021,"We suggest there are two major goals for systems biology in infection medicine: (1) to identify subgroups of patients that share treatable features; and, (2) to integrate high-throughput data from clinical and in vitro sources in order to predict tractable therapeutic targets with the potential to alter disease trajectories for individual patients."
16022,The identification of dystrophin and the causative role of mutations in this gene in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (D/BMD) was expected to lead to timely development of effective therapies.
16023,"Despite over 20 years of research, corticosteroids remain the only available pharmacological treatment for DMD, although significant benefits and extended life have resulted from advances in the clinical care and management of DMD individuals."
16024,"Effective treatment of DMD will require dystrophin restitution in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and nonmuscle tissues; however, modulation of muscle loss and regeneration has the potential to play an important role in altering the natural history of DMD, particularly in combination with other treatments."
16025,"Emerging biological, molecular, and small molecule therapeutics are showing promise in ameliorating this devastating disease, and it is anticipated that regulatory environments will need to display some flexibility in order to accommodate the new treatment paradigms."
16026, HIV infects the central nervous system (CNS) during primary infection and persists in resident macrophages.
16027,CNS infection initiates a strong local immune response that fails to control the virus but is responsible for by-stander lesions involved in neurocognitive disorders.
16028,"Although highly active anti-retroviral therapy now offers an almost complete control of CNS viral proliferation, low-grade CNS inflammation persists."
16029,This review focuses on HIV-induced intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis.
16030,Intrathecal Ig synthesis early occurs in more than three-quarters of patients in response to viral infection of the CNS and persists throughout the course of the disease.
16031,Viral antigens are targeted but this specific response accounts for <5% of the whole intrathecal synthesis.
16032,"Although the nature and mechanisms leading to non-specific synthesis are unknown, this prominent proportion is comparable to that observed in various CNS viral infections."
16033,"Cerebrospinal fluid-floating antibody-secreting cells account for a minority of the whole synthesis, which mainly takes place in perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the CNS parenchyma."
16034,B-cell traffic and lineage across the blood–brain-barrier have not yet been described.
16035,We review common technical pitfalls and update the pending questions in the field.
16036,"Moreover, since HIV infection is associated with an intrathecal chronic oligoclonal (and mostly non-specific) Ig synthesis and associates with low-grade axonal lesions, this could be an interesting model of the chronic intrathecal synthesis occurring during multiple sclerosis."
16037, Oxymatrine is one of the alkaloids extracted from Chinese herb Sophora japonica (Sophora flavescens Ait.)
16038,"with activities of anti-inflammation, inhibiting immune reaction, antivirus, protecting hepatocytes and antihepatic fibrosis."
16039,"However, the effect of oxymatrine on acute lung injury (ALI) has not been known yet."
16040,"In this study, the effect of oxymatrine on ALI was investigated using an oleic acid-induced ALI mouse model."
16041,"Morphological findings showed that the oleic acid group demonstrated a marked lung injury represented by prominent atelectasis, intraalveolar and interstitial patchy hemorrhage, edema, thickened alveolar septum, formation of hyaline membranes and the existence of inflammatory cells in alveolar spaces."
16042,"While in the oxymatrine/dexamethasone group, these changes were less severe and in the vicinity of the control group."
16043,"Furthermore, pretreatment with oxymatrine significantly alleviated oleic acid-induced lung injury accompanied by reduction of lung index and wet-to-dry weight ratio, decreases in serum TNF-α level and inhibition of phosphorylated p38 MAPK."
16044,"These findings suggest that oxymatrine has a beneficial effect on acute lung injury induced by oleic acid in mice and may inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, by means of the inhibition of p38 MAPK."
16045,61 Alternative vaccine delivery methods
16046,"Since important agents of viral nosocomial infections like hepatitis B and C viruses and norovirus do not replicate sufficiently in cell culture systems, disinfectants with suspected efficacy against these viruses must be evaluated by different methods."
16047,"Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests."
16048,"Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible."
16049,"In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses."
16050,Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus.
16051,"By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants."
16052,Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection.
16053,"In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection."
