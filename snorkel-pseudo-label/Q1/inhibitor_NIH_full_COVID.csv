zgdbvfi4,"Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation","In December 2019, cluster of patients with pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1, 2 Shortly, a new coronavirus, temporally named 2019-nCov, was identified to be the cause of the disease, which is the seventh member of the family betacoronavirus. 1 More than 2,700 infection cases and 80 deaths were reported as of 27January 2020 from China. In addition, infection cases have been reported from Thailand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Vietnam, Canada and Nepal, indicating that the disease is a potential threat to the global health. 3 Sadly, the number is still growing rapidly and no drug has been approved to be effective. Therefore, it is urgent to discover and develop drugs to cure the disease.Based on its function, the main protease (M pro ) or chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) 4 is suggested to be a potential drug target to combat 2019-nCov, which is highly conservable among coronaviruses. Sequence alignment revealed that the M pro of 2019-nCov shares 96% similarity with that of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) (Figure 1 ). Studies for identifying the inhibitors of 2019-nCov M pro were quickly performed for discovering and developing drugs against the disease. For example, Hualiang Jiang and collaborators identified 30 drugs and compounds as the M pro inhibitors via protein modelling and virtual screening, which is a rapid progress in the way to cope with the crisis. In addition, one of the 30 drugs/compounds, remdesivir, was also suggested to be potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov by Liu et al, 5 For finding more potential drugs as inhibitors of the protein, we modelled the 2019-nCov M pro structures using SARS M pro (PDB ID: 2GTB) as template and docked 1903 approved drugs against the model in this study. Fifteen drugs were selected based on the docking score and three dimensional (3D) similarity to available M pro inhibitors against other coronavirus. For validation, we modelled 10 additional new models of 2019-nCov M pro and docked the 15 drugs against the new models, which revealed that 6 drugs (nelfinavir, praziquantel, pitavastatin, perampanel, eszopiclone, and zopiclone) have good binding modes with the new models. Binding free energy calculation were then performed for 4 of the 6 drugs using MM/GBSA and SIE methods. Nelfinavir was identified as the best one with predicted binding free energies of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol by MM/GBSA and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol by SIE, respectively. Taking into account its high 3D similarity of binding mode to the known M pro inhibitor, we proposed that nelfinavir should be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov M pro .2.1 Homology modelling. 43 M pro complexes with ligands were downloaded from protein data bank 6 (PDB IDs: 1WOF, 2A5I, 2A5K, 2ALV, 2AMD, 2GTB, 2GX4, 2GZ7,   2GZ8, 2OP9, 2QIQ, 2V6N, 2ZU4, 2ZU5, 3SN8, 3SND, 3SZN, 3TIT, 3TIU, 3TNS,   3TNT, 3V3M, 4F49, 4MDS, 4TWW, 4TWY, 4WY3, 4YLU, 4YOG, 4YOI, 4YOJ,   4ZRO, 5C5N, 5C5O, 5EU8, 5N5O, 5N19, 5NH0, 5WKJ, 5WKK, 5WKL, 5WKM, author/funder.

The hydrogens were added to 2019-nCov M pro model by pdb2pqr (--ff=amber --ffout=amber --chain --with-ph=7). 13 Then the model was converted to pdbqt format by prepare_receptor4.py script in MGLToos version 1.5.6. 10 The ligand in 2GTB was used to define the grid and the buffer space was set to 6.0 Å (autobox_add). The random seed was explicitly set to 0 (seed). The exhaustiveness of the global search was set to 32 (exhaustiveness) and at most 1 binding mode was generated for each drug (num_modes). MolShaCS, which utilized Gaussianbased description of molecular shape and charge distribution, was used to calculate the 3D similarities between approved drugs and available M pro inhibitors. 14 2.4 Molecular dynamics simulation. Each simulation system was immersed in a cubic box of TIP3P water that was extended by 9 Å from the solute, with a rational number of counter ions of Na + or Clto neutralize the system. General Amber force field (GAFF) 15 and Amber ff03 force field 16 were used to parameterize the ligand and protein, respectively. 10,000 steps of minimization with constraints (10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) on heavy atoms of complex, including 5,000 steps of steepest descent minimization and 5,000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, was used to optimize each system. Then each system was heated to 300 K within 0.2 ns followed by 0.1 ns equilibration in NPT ensemble. Finally, 5 ns MD simulation on each system at 300 K was performed. The minimization, heating and equilibrium are performed with sander program in Amber16.The 5 ns production run was performed with pmemd.cuda.Based on the 5 ns MD simulation trajectory, bind author/funder.

ΔGgb and ΔGnp refer to polar and non-polar solvation free energies, respectively. Conformational entropy (TΔS) was calculated by nmode module in Amber16.

After visualizing the docked complexes carefully, we selected 15 drugs (Table 2) for further analysis.

Therefore, we modelled 10 new homology models using the proteins in 3D similarity reference as templates and we redocked the 15 drugs to the 10 new homology models. 6 drugs (nelfinavir, pitavastatin, perampanel, praziquantel, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) show good docking scores and binding modes (Table 3) . Because eszopiclone and zopiclone was used to treat insomnia in a low dosage which may not be suitable to treat pneumonia, we carried out further binding free energy calculation for the rest 4 drugs. author/funder.

To provide insight into their binding mechanisms, the binding free energies were calculated by MM/GBSA and SIE approaches. In results of the MM/GBSA approach, the calculated binding free energies of nelfinavir-2GX4, pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, are -24.69±0.52, -12.70±0.38, -14.98±0.34, and -6.51±0.21 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 4) , which highlight nelfinavir as the most active one. In pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, the van der Waals interaction (E vdw ) makes a more significant contribution than the electrostatic interaction (E ele ) ( As shown in Figure 2 , the binding model of nelfinavir in its docking complex turned out to be very similar with that of the original ligand (TG-0205221) 25 author/funder.

However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease.2019-nCov M pro is a potential drug target to combat the virus, which shares 96% sequence similarity with the corresponding one in SARS. We built 11 homology models of 2019-nCov M pro and docked 1903 approved small molecule drugs to the 2GTB model. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of binding mode to 39 known M pro binders, 15 drugs were selected for further evaluation. The 15 drugs were then docked to all the 11 homology models, leading to 4 drugs for binding energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE calculations voted for nelfinavir, a HIV-1 protease inhibitor to treat HIV. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be active against 2019-nCov M pro .

iu2ziccm,Therapeutic Drugs Targeting 2019-nCoV Main Protease by High-Throughput Screening,"Since December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, China. Genome sequencing of samples from these patients confirmed that the culprit of these infections was a beta-coronavirus that has never been reported before, which was later named as 2019-nCoV [1, 2] . By Jan 28, 2020, more than 4500 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV, and nearly 100 patients were died from the infection. So far, the infection keeps spreading and more and more exported cases were confirmed in other provinces in China, and several other countries, including the United States, posing great pressure on public health security.The discovery and clinical application of specific drugs against 2019-nCoV is an effective means to alleviate the current epidemic. However, there are no clinically effective drugs for this virus for the moment. Although 2019-nCoV is significantly different from SARS-CoV, which breakout in Beijing 17 years before [3] , the sequence identity between themis as high as 79.5%. Further sequence alignment revealed that the similarity of the sequence of the main protease between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV is up to 96.1%. Previous study demonstrated that the main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, and is considered to be an attractive target for drug development [4] . Thus, this protein could be used as a homologous target to screening drugs that inhibiting the replication and proliferation of 2019-nCoV.In order to screening the possible drug candidates that were able to prevent or cure the infection, high-throughput screening was performed based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries using the online software Vina and SeeSAR, combined with our in-house automatic processing scripts and screening programs, and 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease were identified. author/funder.

In view of the activity and safety of these wildly used drugs, it is feasible to conduct clinical exploratory treatment in special cases such as the outbreak of 2019-nCoV.Here we report the identify and structure of these molecules.The CDS and proteins of Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (Accession: NC_045512.2) were obtained from NBCI database. The structures and sequences of SARS-CoV main protease were downloaded from PDB database. Nearly 8000 molecules were obtained from Drugbank [5] , including the approval or experimental compounds and small moleculesMolecular similarity search was performed by using a strategy based on the similar sequences ofthe structure-revealed molecules. The NCBI-blast v2.9 was installed in local machine, then a local database was established by the molecular sequences of SARS-CoV main protease from PDB. The blastp was ran by default parameter.The AutoDock vina was obtained from website of scripps.edu [6] . The crystal structure of main protease monomer (PDB id: 5n5o) was used as target protein after removing the unrelated complex molecule by AutoDockTools. The receptor was prepared by removing water, adding hydrogen and computing charges. The binding coordinates were located by Grid box including the cave near N-terminal and the joint groove of dimer. Autodocking was performed by using multithread tasks by our in-house script, and potential molecules were screening out by a Perl program author/funder. All rights reserved.

Then those molecules were removed such as toxin, experimental and unapproved ones, and those with strong side effects. Finally, the candidate drugs were selected with better affinities in Vina and SeeSAR.We downloaded the sequences of a total of 103 SARS-CoV main proteases with different origins from PDB and built a local library for homology alignment. The result revealed that the similarity between the region at 3264 ~ 3570 aa of 2019-nCoV ORF1 ab protein and SARS-CoV main protease 5n5o was up to 96.1% (Fig. 1) . Thus, the main protease is highly conserved and main protease 5n5ocan be used as a homologous target for screening of possible drugs against 2019-nCoV.There were three binding pockets detected in the viral main protease by computation, as labeled in Fig.2C . In comparison to the dimer and monomer structure of the protein ( Fig.2A and B) , we could figure out that the pocket 1 was the binding site with natural substrate, pocket 2 was the joint groove between two monomers, and author/funder.

Finally, 4 molecules were identified, The binding energies of No. 6651 molecule (Prulifloxacin, Fig. 3A ) to viral main protease were -8.2 Kcal/mol, -8.2 Kcal/mol, -7.9 kcal/mol at three binding sites, respectively (Fig. 3B) , which were the cave adjacent to the N-terminal, the dimer joint groove and its back side. Moreover, at several docking poses, all of the estimated affinitiesof binding were between μ M to mM. The evaluations of ligand-lipophilicity efficiency (LLE), torsion and clash were also satisfied.The binding sites between Bictegravir and the main protease was displayed at Fig. 4B , the binding energy between Bictegravir and major protease was -8.3 kcal/mol at the joint groove, but only -7.3 kcal/mol at the active site, and the estimated affinity is satisfied (Fig. 4C ).The results showed that the binding site between Nelfinavir and the main protease was located at the joint groove (Fig. 5B) .

The binding sites was displayed at Fig. 6B. Although coronaviruses are under extensive mutagenesis, some key proteins, especially replication-related enzymes, are highly conserved [8] . Because the mutation in key proteins are often lethal to the virus [9] , drugs that target conservative protease are usually capable of preventing the replication and proliferation of the virus and exhibit broad spectrum. Besides, they can reduce the risk of mutation mediated drug-resistance.In the current study, based on the results from bioinformatics analysis, the structure of SARS-CoV 5n5o protein was selected as a homologous target for molecule screening. Then, in silico high throughput screening strategy and automatic pipeline have been established by using classic docking software and our in-house program, which greatly accelerates the screening process.Among the four molecules identified in this study, Prulifloxacin is a chemotherapeutic fluoroquinolone antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity, it has been approved for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections, community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Italy and gastroenteritis, including infectious diarrheas, in Japan [10] . Unfortunately, Prulifloxacin is reported as a prodrug, which is rapidly metabolized to ulifloxacin in vivo [11] . But it can be used as a lead compound that provide guidance for our later structural modification and optimization to design more effective main protease inhibitors.

In addition, both of Nelfinavir and Bictegravir are anti-HIV drugs, of which Nelfinavir is a protease Inhibitors inhibit the cleavage of the polyprotein gag-pol [13] , whereas Bictegravir is a new and potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, which is able to efficiently prevent HIV from multiplying and can reduce the amount of HIV in the body [14] .Our results clearly showed that all the four molecules showed reasonable binding conformations with the viral main protease. Among them, Prulifloxacin exhibited three binding sites with main protease, two of which were the same as Nelfinavir andBictegravir. Further, molecule Prulifloxacin, Tegobuvir and Bictegravir are preferable to Nelfinaviras confirmed by affinity and physical-chemical properties analysis using SeeSAR. Based on the pockets' functions of target protein, it suggested that these molecules should possess the abilities to block the active sites or interrupt the dimer formation of viral protein. Therefore, they may sever as promising candidates for drug repurpose and development against 2019-nCoV.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 One of the most important druggable targets is the RdRp. Example drugs include Gilead's sofosbuvir (which is paired with velpatasvir as the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA), to inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the hepatitis C virus. Sofosbuvir, a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue (Fig. 2) with a blocked phosphate group enabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, is a prodrug, which is converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 3) . The activated drug binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to modifications at the 2' position, inhibits further RNA chain extension and halts RNA replication. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides. Based on our insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV and those responsible for SARS and MERS. There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs which are used as antivirals. A related purine nucleotide prodrug, remdesivir (Fig. 4) , was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections, though not very successfully, and is currently being considered for repositioning to treat the 2019-nCoV outbreak (https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gilead-mulls-repositioning-failed-ebola-drug-china-virus).In contrast to sofosbuvir, both the 2'-and 3'-OH groups are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1' position .

Additional information on the ProTide Prodrug technology is described by Alanazi et al (2019) . A related prodrug analogue developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, BCX4430, also known as galidesivir (Fig. 5) , has been shown to inhibit RNA polymerases from a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, notably including the filoviruses (e.g., Ebola, Marburg) in rodents and Marburg virus in macaques (Warren et al 2014) . Upon entry into infected cells, BCX4430 is rapidly phosphorylated, and the resulting nucleoside triphosphate serves as an RNA chain terminator. Based on the above background information, we describe here a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3'-blocking groups that we have built into nucleotide analogues that function as reversible terminators for DNA sequencing (Ju et al 2003 , Ju et al 2006 , Guo et al 2008 . We reasoned that (1) the phosphate masking groups will allow entry of the compounds into infected cells, (2) the 3'-blocking group on the 3'-OH with either free 2'-OH or modifications at the 2' position will encourage incorporation of the activated triphosphate analogue by viral polymerases but not host cell polymerases, thus reducing any side effects, and (3) once incorporated, further extension will be prevented by virtue of the 3'-blocking group, thereby inhibiting viral replication. These modified nucleotide analogues should be potent polymerase inhibitors and thus active against various viral diseases, including but not limited to the coronaviruses such .

Once incorporated, our newly designed nucleotide analogues containing 3' blocking groups will permanently block further viral genome replication. This is in contrast to other nucleotide analogue-based viral inhibitors that have a free 3' OH group, which have the possibility of allowing further polymerase extension, enabled by viral mutations. For the same reason, at high concentrations, nucleotide analogue-based viral inhibitors with free 3' OH groups have the potential of being incorporated by host polymerases.All RNA viruses are known to mutate at a high frequency, due to the low fidelity of the viral polymerase, resulting in the development of resistance to treatment. The promiscuous nature of the viral polymerase will allow incorporation of our newly designed nucleotide analogues as anti-viral agents.Examples of nucleotide analogues designed by us to satisfy these criteria are provided in Fig. 6 , and strategies for their synthesis in Figs. 7-9; Fig. 10 shows the activation of these prodrugs to form triphosphate analogues (same as for sofosbuvir in Fig. 3 ) that should be incorporated and inhibit the coronavirus and other RNA virus polymerases.

First, both the 5'-OH and the exocyclic amino group of the base will be protected. Then the 3'-OH will be derivatized with a variety of blocking groups, including methyl, ethyl, propyl, allyl, propargyl, methoxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, azidomethyl, etc ., such as those listed in Fig.6 , following established methods (Ju et al 2006 , Guo et al 2008 .

1qniriu0,Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs,"A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged with connections to Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, Hubei Province of China in late December 2019. On January 7, 2020, a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the causative agent, and the World Health Organization (WHO) named this novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV on January 10. By January 30, a total of 9692 confirmed cases with 213 deaths had been reported in the world. As reported in, 1 in comparison with the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which is about 4.91, R 0 of the 2019-nCoV epidemic was estimated as high as 6.47, which implies the severity of this widespread dissemination caused by 2019-nCoV. Under the current health emergency, many researchers around the world engaged in the investigation of the genetic and functional data of 2019-nCoV and compare to other coronaviruses to design proper infection control strategy 2, 3 and seek potential drugs that can prevent and/or cure this serious epidemic. [4] [5] [6] [7] On January 10, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was first released on GenBank (accession MN908947) by Yong-Zhen Zhang's group at Fudan University. 8 Subsequently, phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV belonged to the Betacoronavirus genera and its closest whole-genome relatives are two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, i.e., ZC45 and ZXC21, which shared about 89% sequence identity with 2019-nCoV. 6, 7 Moreover, detailed sequence alignment data indicates that there is significant genetics distance between the 2019-nCoV and the human SARS-CoV. Therefore, the 2019-nCoV should be considered as a new type of bat coronavirus. However, this observation raised a worth-thinking issue whether the 2019-nCoV has the same infective mechanisms as the human SARS-CoV.The spike protein (S-protein), which is known as the multi-functional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells 9 is discussed to answer the question mentioned above. According to the literature, 5, 6 the 2019-nCoV and the SARS-CoV have a high amino acid sequence homology of the S-protein, which can result in severe human infections. Further structural similarity analysis showed and confirmed that the S-protein of 2019-nCoV uses the same human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV. 4, 10 Therefore, similar approaches can be applied to prevent the S-protein binding with the receptor ACE2.S-protein is one of the four proteins in coronavirus, which can be cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease (non-structural protein in coronavirus) into two functional units, S1 and S2. S1 makes up the large receptorbinding domain (RBD) to facilitates virus infection by binding to host receptors and S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule. 11 Therefore, one possible way to control the infection is to seek protease inhibitors to prevent the S-protein of 2019-nCoV cleaved into S1. Another possible way is to seek specific drugs that have the ability to inhibit RBD binding to host receptors. However, consider the fact that the diversity of CoV is reflected in the variable S-proteins and the gene of S-protein is easy to mutate, [12] [13] [14] [15] it is not economical to design a new drug to prevent the RBD binding to host receptor directly. Moreover, considering the high sequence identity between viral proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, seeking protease inhibitors to treat respiratory diseases induced by SARS and this novel pneumonia will be our first choice. Viral proteases are common targets in dealing with human viruses such as the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus. Protease inhibitors are remarkably effective in blocking the replication of coronavirus, including the SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), providing a promising foundation for the development of anticoronaviral therapeutics. An overview of SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors has been reported. 16 However, currently, there are no effective anti-SARS-CoV drugs available despite there are more than 3500 publications. It is true that there were only 8422 infected cases and 916 deaths reported for SARS-CoV, which might make the drug development unprofitable. The fact that we are unprepared for another coronaviral pandemic, like the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, causes the world economy trillion dollars, not to mention the loss of many lives.The present work makes use of a recently developed generative network complex (GNC) 17 to explore potential protease inhibitors for curing 2019-nCoV. We generate anticoronaviral therapeutic candidates for 2019-nCoV and evaluate their druggable properties. We also examine the potential of repurposing HIV protease inhibitors, Aluvia and Norvir, for 2019-nCoV.properties. The next component is the MathPose model which is used to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure information of the compounds selected by 2DFP-DNN. The bioactivities of those compounds are further estimated by the structure-based deep learning model named MathDL. 18 The druggable properties predicted by this last component of our GNC are used as an indicator to select the promising drug candidates. Figure 1 : A schematic illustration of the generative network complex. SMILES strings (SSs) are encoded into latent space vectors via a gated recurrent neural network (GRU)-based encoder. These vectors are modified in the molecule generator to achieve desirable druggable properties, such as binding affinity, partition coefficient (LogP), similarity, etc., predicted by pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting drug-like molecules are translated into SSs by a GRU-based decoder. The physical properties of these SSs are validated by 2D fingerprint-based multitask DNNs. Promising drug candidates are fed into a MathPose unit to generate 3D structures, which are further validated by a mathematical deep learning (MathDL) center to select new drug candidates. 18 The autoencoder, consisting of an encoder, a latent space, and a decoder, is used to encode a molecular SMILES string into a latent space representation X, which, after being further modified by a molecular generator, is translated back to a SMILES string by a decoder. Both the encoder and decoder are constructed by using gated recurrent neural networks (GRUs). GRUs can deal with the vanishing gradient problem occurred in recurrent neural network (RNN) models but are simpler than long-short-term memory (LSTM) models. GRUs are suitable for moderately complex sequences, such as small molecular SMILES strings. A pre-trained autoencoder model developed by Winter et al is adopted in the present work. 19 The latent space vector (X ∈ R n ) or molecular representation has the dimension of 512 (n = 512).In the present approach, novel molecules are initially designed at the molecule generator using a three-step procedure. In the first step, the latent space representation of a seed molecule is evaluated for their drug-like properties, such as binding affinities, solubility (logS), partition coefficient, similarity, etc., via pre-trained DNNs. The DNN consists of two hidden layers with 1024 neurons in each layer. In our second step, evaluation results ({ŷ i (X)} ) are compared with a set of target values ({y i0 }) via a loss function,where k i is a preselected weight coefficient for the ith property. The last step is to optimize the loss function with a gradient decent algorithm. The resulting new vector X is sent back to the pre-trained DNNs for reevaluation until the loss function is smaller than a given tolerance. Only the desirable molecule representation X is sent to the decoder to generate a SMILES string. Alternatively, a Monte Carlo procedure can be used to replace the gradient decent.New SMILES strings generated by the decoder is passed to 2D fingerprint-based predictors (2DFPs) to reevaluate druggable properties. 17 These predictors are pre-trained deep neural networks involving multiple hidden layers with hundreds or even thousands of neurons on each layer. During the training, weights on each layer are updated by backpropagation. The multitask deep learning architecture is often used to enhance small dataset predictions. The input 2D molecular fingerprints are generated from a combination of ECFP 20 and MACCS 21 fingerprints, yielding 2214 bits of features (2048 bits from ECFP and 166 bits from MACCS) in total. RDKit 22 is used for to translate SMILES strings into 2D fingerprints. The output drug properties include binding affinity, logP, and logS, etc.Our MathDL is a mathematical representation-based deep learning platform designed for predicting various druggable properties of 3D molecules. 18 Mathematical representations used in MathDL are algebraic topology (such as persistent homology), differential geometry, and graph theory-based algorithms developed over the past many years. These approaches were repeatedly validated by their top performance in free energy prediction and ranking at D3R Grand Challenges, a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge). 18, 23 More details about the mathematical representation of complex molecules can be found in a recent review. 24 A variety of datasets, particularly, PDBbind datasets, 25 were used in our training of deep learning networks. A further discussion of MathDL is given in our recent work. 17MathPose is a 3D pose predictor that converts SMILES strings into 3D poses with references of target molecules. For a given SMILES string, about 1000 3D structures are generated by several common docking software tools, i.e., Autodock Vina, 26 GOLD, 27 and GLIDE. 28 Additionally, a selected set of known complexes is re-docked by the aforementioned three docking software packages to generate at 100 decoy complexes per input ligand as a machine learning training set. In this training set, the calculated root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) between the decoy and native structures are used as machine learning labels. Then, we set up MathDL models and apply them to pick up the top-ranked pose for the given ligand. The MathPose-generated top poses are fed to the MathDL for druggable property evaluation. Our MathPose was the top performer in D3R Grand Challenge 4 in predicting the poses of 24 beta-secretase 1 (BACE) binders. 18The sequence identity is defined as the percentage of characters which match exactly between two different sequences. The sequence identities between 2019-nCoV protease and some other coronaviral proteases are presented in Table 1 . It is seen that 2019-nCoV protease is very close to SARS-CoV protease, but is distinguished from other proteases. Clearly, 2019-nCoV has a strong genetic relationship with SARS-CoV. Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease.The 2019-nCoV protease (PDB ID 6lu7) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2gx4) have an excellent similarity. As shown in Fig. 2 , two crystal structures are essentially identical to each other. Particularly, the RMSD of two crystal structures at the binding site is 0.53 Å. When we try to carry a homology modeling of 2019-nCoV protease structure from its sequence using SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2gx4) as a model, the resulting 2019-nCoV protease homology structure has an RMSD of 0.9 Å (or 0.2 Å at the binding site region) with its crystal structure 6lu7. The high structural similarity between the two proteases suggests that anti-SARS-CoV chemicals can be equally effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV. ChEMBL, 29 an open database which brings chemical, bioactivity, and genomic data together to translate genomic information into effective new drugs is employed to construct our 2019-nCoV training set. Considering the high sequence identity between viral proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, we take the protease of SARS-CoV as the input target in ChEMBL and a total 115 ChEMBL IDs of the target can be found. Therefore, our 2019-nCoV training set is built up by 115 SARS-CoV protease inhibitors. Figure 4 describes the distribution of experimental ∆G values of 2019-nCoV training set. It can be seen that the experimental ∆G ranges from −10.0 kcal/mol to 7.5 kcal/mol, and most training samples have the experimental ∆G located in the range of [−10, −5] kcal/mol. Followed by the second law of thermodynamics, the more negative ∆G can result in a more spontaneous binding process. Figure 3 depicts the top five anti-SARS CoV compounds and their banding affinities. 29 In this work, 115 SARS-nCoV protease inhibitors from ChEMBL are used as the 2019-nCoV training set. A collection of these 115 compounds is given in the Supplementary material.The PDBbind database is a yearly updated collection of experimentally measured binding affinity data (Kd, Ki, and IC50) for the protein-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PDBbind refined set contains high-quality X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes and associated binding affinities. 25 The refined set is selected by filtering through binding data, crystal structures, as well as the nature of the complexes. 25 The PDBbind 2018 refined set of 4463 complexes is employed as the major part of our binding affinity training set. Additionally, taring data are collected from recent D3R Grand Challenges (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge) and a few hundreds of Pfizer molecules, which, however, mostly unrelated to the present coronaviral protease.Binding free energies are computed with four methods, namely, the latent space binding predictor (LS-BP), the 2D fingerprint predictor (2DFP), a 3D deep learning model trained with the mixture all datasets, including the dataset for coronaviral protease (denoted as ""3DALL""), and finally, a 3D deep learning multitask model trained with the dataset for coronaviral protease as a separated task (denoted as 3DMT). Table 2 as references. Table 2 lists a few other druggable properties, including partition coefficient (logP), solubility (logS), and synthesizability.The top-ranking candidate of our generated molecules is MSU3298 (see Figure 5 ). Its predicted binding affinity to the nCoV-2019 protease is -10.56 kcal/mol, which is higher than that of the best candidate CHEMBL222234 (-10.02 kcal/mol). The high binding affinity is due to the existence of many hydrogen bond acceptors and donors and forming a strong hydrogen bond network with nCoV-2019 protease. For example, the strongest hydrogen affinity is also due to the strong interaction at the tail of the molecule. One Cl atom on the quaternary ring forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue Arg188. One O atom in this tail also has a hydrogen bond with the main chain of residue Tyr54. In the head of the molecules, the two Cl atoms interact with the methanethiol of residue Cys145 and the main-chain amino of residue Glu166. These hydrogen bonds promise a strong binding to 2019-nCoV protease binding site. The third molecule is MSU3245 (see Figure 7 ) with a binding affinity -9.55 kcal/mol. The strongest hydrogen bonds between this molecule and the protease are the Cl atom on the benzene ring of the molecule and the side-chain hydroxyl of the residue Ser144. Additionally, the Cl atom of the ternary ring and the methanethiol in residue Cys144.Essentially nCoV-2019 protease and inhibit its function.Aqueous solubility, a chemical property denoted by its logarithm value logS, reveals how a solute dissolves in a solvent which will affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes (ADME) in drug discovery and other pharmaceutical fields. 30 It is part of the pharmacokinetics studies. In this work, we calculate the logS values for all of the new potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs using our 2DFP-based logS predictor. between −5.000 and −1.000. However, only two potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs (i.e., MSU2313 and MSU3289) in Table 2 have the logS values in the range of [−5.00, −1.00], while the others have a little bit higher value of logS. One possible reason is that our 2DFP-based calculation of logS may have a systematic error. Another possible explanation is that our anti-2019-nCoV drug candidates may not be absorbed through membranes as easily as some other drugs on the market. In our future study, a stronger logS constraint will be imposed in our molecule generator.The partition coefficient, which measures how hydrophilic or hydrophobic a chemical substance is, is defined as the ratio of concentrations of a solute in a mixture of two immersible solvents at equilibrium. 33 The logarithm of partition coefficient, denoted logP, is a well-known coefficient which plays an essential role in governing kinetic and dynamic aspects of drug action. In this paper, we will employ an Open-Source Cheminformatics Software Rdkit 22 to calculate logP values of our 2019-nCoV drug candidates to evaluate the reliability of the potential 2019-nCoV drugs we predicted. All of the logP values of all predicted molecules can be found in the Supplementary Materials. While the logP values of the predicted top 15 drug candidates are presented in Table 2 . From the table, it can be observed that most 2019-nCoV drug candidates we predicted have the logP value smaller than 5, which matches one of the rules in ""Lipinski's rule of five"". 34 Moreover, the ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor already on the market, has a predicted logP = 5.91, which shows that our potential drugs with logP values slightly larger than 5 can still be considered as druggable molecules.Moreover, consider the fact that logP also has the ability to measure the solubility of the solute in liquids, we are more likely to say that our logS calculation method in subsection 4.1 is not as precise as expected. These issues can be addressed by placing a stronger logS constraint in the latent space.. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

The synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) between 1 (easy to make) and 10 (very difficult to make) is described in. 35 The SAscores of our drug candidates are calculated by the Rdkit as the evaluation of the molecules' synthesizability. The last column in the Table 2 lists the SAscores of our Top 15 anti-2019-nCoV molecules. The molecule ID: MSU3519 has the highest SAscore equals to 4.69, which reveals that most of our potential anti-2019-nCoV molecules are quite easy to synthesize.Lopinavir is an antiretroviral medication used to inhibit HIV/AIDS viral protease. It is often used as a fixed-dose combination with another protease inhibitor, ritonavir, sold under the name Kaletra or Aluvia. Ritonavir, sold under the trade name Norvir, is another antiretroviral medication. Its combination with Lopinavir is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although there is no tractable clinical evidence, Kaletra or Aluvia has been proposed as a potential anticoronavirus drug for 2019-nCoV. The possibility of repurposing some HIV drugs for SARS-CoV treatment has also studied in the literature. 16 It is important to evaluate their binding affinities, which are obtained with two ligand-based methods (i.e., LS-BP and 2DFP) and two 3D models (3DALL and 3DMT). To carry out 3D model predictions, we dock them to the 2019-nCoV protease inhibition site. The resulting complexes are optimized with molecular dynamics and then evaluated by 3DALL and 3DMT. Table 1 shows the low sequence identity between HIV viral protease and 2019-nCoV protease, which might suggest the limited potential for repurposing Aluvia and Norvir for 2019-nCoV treatment. For Lopinavir, our LS-BP and 2DFP predicted the binding affinities of -5.66 kcal/mol and -5.54 kcal/mol, respectively. For Ritonavir, similar low binding affinities of -5.14 kcal/mol and -4.96 kcal/mol were predicted by our LS-BP and 2DFP, respectively. However, our 3D model 3DALL predicted better binding affinities, i.e., -7.78 kcal/mol and -8.44 kcal/mol for Lopinavir and Ritonavir, respectively. The other 3D model, 3DMT, also predicted moderately high binding affinities of -8.13 kcal/mol and -8.07 kcal/mol for Lopinavir and Ritonavir, respectively. Considering the fact that the small training set for LS-BP and 2DFP models is very small, the results predicted by 3D models are more reliable. Figures 20 and 21 indicate that these drugs have reasonable dock poses with 2019-nCoV protease. Therefore, HIV drugs Kaletra (or Aluvia) and Norvir might indeed have a moderate effect in the treatment of 2019-nCoV. However, Many new compounds generated by our GNC appear to have better druggable properties than these HIV inhibitors do. epidemic. Although we know quite a little about 2019-nCoV, it is fortunate that the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. In this work, we show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. Additionally, we employed a recently developed generative network complex (GNC) to seek potential protease inhibitors for effective treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV. Two datasets 13 .

One is a SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset, which is constructed by collecting 115 SRAS-CoV inhibitors from open database ChEMBL. The other dataset is a binding affinity training set mainly containing the PDBbind refined set. Our GNC model predicts over 8000 potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs which are evaluated by a latent space binding predictor (LS-BP) and a 2D fingerprint predictor (2DFP). Promising drug candidates are further evaluated by two 3D deep learning models trained with all the training sets together, including the dataset for coronaviral protease (3DALL), and the 3D deep learning multitask model trained with the dataset for coronaviral protease as a separated task (3DMT). Furthermore, we choose 15 potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs to analyze partition coefficient (logP), solubility (logS), and synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) according to binding affinity ranking computed by the 3DALL model. The reasonable logP, logS, and SAscore show that our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV drug candidates are potentially effective for inhibiting 2019-nCoV. Finally, the effectiveness of some anti-HIV/AIDS drugs for treating 2019-nCoV is analyzed. Although HIV drugs Kaletra (or Aluvia) and Norvir might indeed have a moderate effect in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, the analysis of these anti-HIV/AIDS drugs together with our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV molecules shows that the new compounds generated by our GNC appear to have better druggable properties than these HIV inhibitors do.SupplementaryMaterial-1.csv: A list of SMILES strings, predicted binding affinities, logP, logS and synthesizability of 319 potential inhibitors of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease, including two anti-HIV protease drugs.SupplementaryMaterial-2.csv: The SMILES strings, experimental binding affinities of 115 potential SARS inhibitors from ChEMBL.

cszqykpu,"Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model","Coronaviruses (CoVs), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, are positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses and cause infections in birds, mammals, and humans (1) (2) (3) . The family includes four genera, such as Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (4) . Two infamous infectious coronaviruses in the genus Betacoronavirus are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (5) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (6) , which have infected more than 10,000 people around the world in the past two decades. Unfortunately, the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates (9.6% for SARS-CoV and 34.4% for MERS-CoV), indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread (7, 8) . However, this cannot be achieved with current drug development or an application system, taking several years for newly developed drugs to come to the market.Unexpectedly, the world is facing the same situation as the previous outbreak due to a recent epidemic of atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China (5, 9) . Thus, a rapid drug application strategy that can be immediately applied to the patient is necessary. Currently, the only way to address this matter is to repurpose commercially available drugs for the pathogen in so-called ""drug-repurposing"". However, in theory, artificial intelligence (AI)-based architectures must be taken into account in order to accurately predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). This is because of the enormous amount of complex information (e.g. hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and/or van der Waals forces) between molecules. To this end, we previously developed a deep learning-based drug-target interaction prediction model, called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) (10) .In this study, we applied our pre-trained MT-DTI model to identify commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially disrupt 2019-nCoV's viral components, such as proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and/or helicase. Since the model utilizes simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings and amino acid (AA) sequences, which are 1D string inputs, it is possible to quickly apply target proteins that do not have experimentally confirmed 3D crystal structures, such as viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. We share a list of top commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially hinder the multiplication cycle of 2019-nCoV with the hope that effective drugs can be developed based on these AI-proposed drug candidates and act against 2019-nCoV..

The raw prediction results were screened for antiviral drugs that are FDA approved, target viral proteins, and have a Kd value less than 1,000 nM.Molecule transformer-drug target interaction (MT-DTI) was used to predict binding affinity values between commercially available antiviral drugs and target proteins. Briefly, the natural language processing (NLP) based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework is a core algorithm of the model with good performance and robust results in diverse drug-target interaction datasets through pretraining with 'chemical language' SMILES of approximately 1,000,000,000 compounds.To train the model, the Drug Target Common (DTC) database (11) and BindingDB (12) database were manually curated and combined. Three types of efficacy value, Ki, Kd, and IC50 were integrated by a consistence-score-based averaging algorithm (13) to make the Pearson correlation score over 0.9 in terms of Ki, Kd, and IC50. Since the BindingDB database includes a wide variety of species and target proteins, the MT-DTI model has the potential power to predict interactions between antiviral drugs and 2019-nCoV proteins.The 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase was predicted to bind with atazanavir (Kd 94.94 nM), followed by efavirenz, ritonavir, and other antiviral drugs that have a predicted affinity of Kd > 100 nM potency (Table   1 ). No other protease inhibitor antiviral drug was found in the Kd < 1,000 nM range. Although there is . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

For example, a docking study of lopinavir along with other HIV proteinase inhibitors of the CoV proteinase (PDBID 1UK3) suggests atazanavir and ritonavir, which are listed in the present prediction results, may inhibit the CoV proteinase in line with the inhibitory potency of lopinavir (14) . According to the prediction, viral proteinase-targeting drugs were predicted to act more favorably on the viral replication process than viral proteinase through the DTI model (Table 2 -6) . The results include antiviral drugs other than proteinase inhibitors, such as guanosine analogues (e.g., acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir), reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors.Among the prediction results, atazanavir was predicted to have a potential binding affinity to bind to Table   2 -6) . Also, ganciclovir was predicted to bind to three subunits of the replication complex of the 2019-nCoV: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Kd 11.91 nM), 3'-to-5' exonuclease (Kd 56.29 nM), and RNA helicase (Kd 108.21 nM). Lopinavir and ritonavir, active materials of AbbVie's Kaletra, both were predicted to have a potential affinity to 2019-nCoV helicase (Table 3 ) and are suggested as potential MERS therapeutics (15) . Recently, approximately $2 million worth of Kaletra doses were donated to China (16) , and a previous clinical study of SARS by Chu et al. (17) may support this decision (17).Another anti-HIV drug, Prezcobix of Johnson & Johnson, which consists of darunavir and cobicistat, was to be sent to China (16) , and darunavir is also predicted to have a Kd of 90.38 nM against 2019-nCoV's helicase (Table 3) . However, there was no current supporting literature found for darunavir to be used as a CoV therapeutic.In many cases, DTI prediction models serve as a tool to repurpose drugs to develop novel usages of existing drugs.

vbgf50os,"Molecular Modeling Evaluation of the Binding Effect of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Darunavir to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Proteases","In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, and then quickly became a rising global concern since World Health Organization had declared it as the sixth public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020. By the time of 14:50 on February 8, 2020, 34638 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in China and 723 patients died from it, resulting in a mortality of 2.2%. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel species of non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus which can spread and distribute in humans and other mammals [1] . Previous studies have discovered that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a distinct clade from the β-coronavirus which is associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2] . Shi ZL et al found that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-related coronavirus and is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [3] , which corresponds to that the origin may be wild animals sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [4] . Recent clinical research found that dyspnea might occur on the fifth day and acute respiratory distress syndrome on the eighth day from first symptom of COVID-19 in median, organ dysfunction and death can also occur in severe COVID-19 cases [5, 6] . However, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19. Finding drugs that can fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a top priority.The trial fifth edition of diagnosis and treatment guideline of COVID-19 issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) recommends to use Kaletra for treatment. Kaletra, an anti-HIV drug which is composed of two protease inhibitors, ritonavir (CAS#: 155213-67-5) and lopinavir (CAS#: 192725-17-0), might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus diseases like SARS and MERS [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, whether it can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 or treat COVID-19 lacks clinical evidences and randomized clinical trials, and the safety of its use in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Otherwise, Lanjuan Li, infectious disease scientist, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, recommended darunavir (CAS#: 206361-99-1), also an HIV protease inhibitor, as a treatment for COVID-19. Although the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 has been verified in vitro, its therapeutic effect on COVID-19 is still unknown. At the same time, the mechanism of how these drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is also unknown.As coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, synthesize polyproteins followed by hydrolyzed to produce their structure and function proteins [11] [12] [13] , it is suggested that ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir may block the multiplication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting its proteases. To preliminarily understand the inhibitory effects of the drugs, in this study, molecular models of the proteases were built by homology modeling, followed by docking the drugs to the proteases, respectively. In addition, the dynamic interactions between the drugs and the protease were also simulated to evaluate the binding effects of the drugs on the proteases.author/funder. All rights reserved.

The sequences of the found protease-like domains were then used to build molecular models by homology modeling through SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . To evaluate qualities, Verify score, Errat score, Prove score and Ramachandran plots of the built models were automatically created by Structure Analysis and Verification server (version 5.0, https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/).To dock ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir to the proteases, respectively, Discovery Studio software (version 2.5, Accelrys Software Inc.) was used. While docking, one of the proteases would be set as receptor, and all its possible docking sites would be found. A sphere whose radius was 17 units would then be set at the optimal docking site, followed by semi-flexible docking of unprotonated ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir to the receptor protease through Dock Ligands (Libdock) module of Discovery Studio software, respectively. The preliminary docking results would be evaluated by Libdock scores and intermolecular interactions through Discovery Studio software.To analyze the structure changes of proteases caused by induced-fit effect after binding the drugs, Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient Algorithms were used to minimize the energy of the protease-drug complexes successively through Minimization module of Discovery Studio software. During calculation, fixed constraint of the backbone of proteins was used first and removed later.By searching the conserved domains of the sequence of orf1ab polyprotein, two protease-like domains were found. One domain is coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30), located from 3292 to 3569 of the polyprotein sequence; the other domain is papain like viral protease (PLVP), located from 1564 to 1880 of the sequence. The sequence of PLVP was directly used for subsequent homology modeling, while the 5 residues at the C-terminal of the sequence of CEP_C30 were deleted before subsequent homology modeling to minimize disordered structures.While modeling CEP_C30, 8 models were built according to 8 automatically found templates. The top-rated model in the 8 models is a homo-dimer with no ligand, and was selected to represent the structure of CEP_C30. While modeling PLVP, 29 models were built according to 16 automatically found templates. The top-rated model in the 29 models is a monomer with a zinc ion ligand, and was selected to represent the structure of PLVP. The structures of the two selected models are available in Supplemental Files S1 and S2. The detailed information, evaluation scores and Ramachandran plots of the two models are shown in Figure 1 .author/funder. All rights reserved.

Through docking drugs to this site, 100 poses were found when docking ritonavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 192.346; 88 poses were found when docking lopinavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 147.123; and 49 poses were found when docking darunavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 149.404. The optimal docking site of PLVP is a pocket in one side of the protein. Through docking drugs to this site, 4 poses were found when docking ritonavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 164.153; 3 poses were found when docking lopinavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 107.137; and 8 poses were found when docking darunavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 139.543. The interactions between the proteases and drugs at the optimal poses are shown in Figure 2 , and the structures of the docked protease-drug complexes at the optimal pose before energy minimization are available in Supplemental Files S3 to S8.Through energy minimization, all protease-drug complexes had some structure changes. The differences between before and after energy minimization of proteasedrug complexes are shown in Figure 3 , and the structures of protease-drug complexes after energy minimization are available in Supplemental Files S9 to S14.In this study, two models of two protease-like domains, CEP_C30 and PLVP, of orf1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were built. Since these two models were built by taking highly homologous crystal structures as templates, their qualities are quite considerable. As it is difficult to obtain the crystal structure of CEP_C30 and PLVP in a short time, there is great significance to use these reliable structure models to predict their dynamic interactions with other molecules.For ritonavir and lopinavir, these two drugs seem more suitable to bind to CEP_C30 rather than PLVP. Through energy minimization, it is suggested that after docking ritonavir or lopinavir, CEP_C30 can be induced to change its conformation significantly to bind the drug tightly. Moreover, ritonavir is more suitable than lopinavir to bind to CEP_C30. As shown in Figure 2 and 3, there are more interactions between CEP_C30 and ritonavir, and the binding between them is tighter. On the contrary, neither ritonavir nor lopinavir seems suitable to bind to PLVP, since the bindings become less tight after energy minimization.For darunavir, this drug seems more suitable to bind to PLVP rather than CEP_C30. Through energy minimization, it is suggested that after docking to PLVP, darunavir can change its conformation significantly to fit PLVP, whose conformation will also be induced to slightly change. On the contrary, darunavir seems not suitable to bind to CEP_C30, since the binding between darunavir and CEP_C30 becomes less tight after energy minimization.author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the .Since the catalytic mechanisms of CEP_C30 and PLVP domains are both unknown, it is unable to determine whether ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir are competitive or non-competitive inhibitors, although these drugs are all peptide analogues and seem to be competitive.As the binding of ritonavir and lopinavir might lead to significant conformation changes of CEP_C30, there is no conclusion whether ritonavir and lopinavir are competitive or non-competitive, since both competitive and non-competitive inhibitors may significantly change the conformation of receptor. For darunavir, as it can bind to PLVP suitably by changing its conformation with slight conformation changes of PLVP, it is more likely to be a competitive inhibitor of PLVP.In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 and other coronavirus disease may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP. However, there are still limitations in this study. As the catalytic mechanisms of CEP_C30 and PLVP are still unknown, in further studies, it should still be focused on to figure out these mechanisms and how ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir block these procedures. The safety and actual effects of these drugs on human body should also be carried out and verified by randomized clinical control studies further. author/funder. All rights reserved.

b4mdiont,Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections [1] . In the past 2 decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality [2] . For example, 8,098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion [3, 4] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2,494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia [2] . In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was found in Wuhan, China. As of February 02, 2020, there have been over 14,000 cases with ~300 deaths for the 2019-nCoV pandemic (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html); furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts [5] . However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV. Several national and international research .

There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV outbreak.Although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development has increased significantly over the past two decades, the annual number of new treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has remained relatively constant and limited [6] . A recent study estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent $2.6 billion in 2015, up from $802 million in 2003, in the development of an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug [7] . Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials [8] [9] [10] . However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and timeconsuming. [11] Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning [8-10, 12, 13] . However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes [1] .Viruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replication during infections [1] . Systematic identification of virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) offers an effective way toward elucidation of the mechanisms of viral infection [14, infections [1] , including SARS-CoV [16] , MERS-CoV [16] , Ebola virus [17] , and Zika virus [13, [18] [19] [20] . We recently presented an integrated antiviral drug discovery pipeline that incorporated gene-trap insertional mutagenesis, known functional drug-gene network, and bioinformatics analyses [13] . This methodology allows to identify several candidate repurposable drugs for Ebola virus [10, 13] . Our work over the last decade has demonstrated how network strategies can, for example, be used to identify effective repurposable drugs [12, [21] [22] [23] [24] and drug combinations [25] for multiple human diseases. For example, network-based drug-disease proximity that sheds light on the relationship between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies [12, 22, 25] .In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology that combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) the proteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network [26] ; and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common PPIs and functional pathways elucidated by the human interactome (Figure 1) . We follow this analysis with bioinformatics validation of drug-induced gene signatures and HCoV-induced .

We performed the phylogenetic analyses using the whole genome sequence data from 15 HCoVs to inspect the evolutionary relationship of 2019-nCoV with other HCoVs. We found that the whole genomes of 2019-nCoV had ~99.99% nucleotide sequence identity across three diagnosed patients (Supplementary Table S1 ). The 2019-nCoV shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity (79.7%) with SARS-CoV among the 6 other known pathogenic HCoVs, revealing conserved evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV (Figure 2A ).HCoVs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viral replications [27] , including replicase complex (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins ( Figure 2B) . The ORF1ab gene encodes the non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral RNA synthesis complex through proteolytic processing [28] . The nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. From the protein threedimensional (3D) structure view of SARS-CoV nsp12, it contains a larger N-terminal extension (which binds to nsp7 and nsp8) and polymerase domain ( Figure 2C ). The .

Figure 2D shows the 3D structure of the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6ACK). A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV is able to utilize ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells [31] , suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development. In addition, the nucleocapsid is also an important subunit for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization [32] , and the single nucleocapsid structure was shown in Figure 2E .Protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV was most evolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2 ). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS- Table S2 ). However, the spike protein exhibited the lowest sequence conservation (sequence identity of 77%) between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV only has 31.9% sequence identity compared to MERS-CoV.First, we assembled the CoV-associated host proteins from 4 known HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), one mouse MHV, and one avian IBV (N protein) (Supplementary Table S3 ). In total, we obtained 119 host proteins associated with CoVs with various experimental evidences. Specifically, these host .

The HCoV-host interactome network is shown in Figure   3A . We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value < 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and influenza ( Figure 3B ). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analyses further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value < 0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology, viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virion attachment to host cell ( Figure 3C ). We then mapped the known drug-target network (see Methods) into the HCoV-host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets.We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Figure 3A ) can be targeted by at least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trial. For example, GSK3B, DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins. The high druggability of HCoV-host interactome motivates us to develop a therapeutic strategy by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with HCoVs, such as drug repurposing.The basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on the notions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern a viral infection are localized in the corresponding subnetwork ( Figure 1A ) within the comprehensive human interactome network.

We used a state-ofthe-art network proximity measure to quantify the relationship between HCoV-specific subnetwork ( Figure 3A ) and drug targets in the human protein-protein interactome. We constructed a drug-target network by assembling target information for more than 2,000 FDA-approved or experimental drugs (see Methods). To improve the quality and completeness of the human protein interactome network, we integrated PPIs with five types of experimental data: (1) binary PPIs from 3D protein structures; (2) binary PPIs from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays; (3) experimentally identified kinase-substrate interactions; (4) signaling networks derived from experimental data; and (5) literature-derived PPIs with various experimental evidences (see Methods). We used a Z-score (Z) measure and permutation test to reduce the study bias in network proximity analyses (including hub nodes in the human interactome network by literaturederived PPI data bias) as described in our recent studies [12, 25] .In total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (Z < -1.5 and P < 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV-host interactome ( Figure 4A author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263 doi: medRxiv preprint vs. SARS-CoV (P < 0.001, t distribution), 0.503 vs. MERS-CoV (P < 0.001), 0.694 vs. IBV (P < 0.001), and 0.829 vs. MHV (P < 0.001). These network proximity analyses offer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs.To further validate the 135 repurposable drugs against HCoVs, we first performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using transcriptome data of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infected host cells (see Methods). These transcriptome data were used as gene signatures for HCoVs. Additionally, we downloaded the expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [33] to obtain drug-gene signatures. We calculated a GSEA score (see Methods) for each drug and used this score as an indication of bioinformatics validation of the 135 drugs. Specifically, an enrichment score (ES) was calculated for each HCoV data set, and ES > 0 and P < 0.05 (permutation test) was used as cut-off for a significant association of gene signatures between a drug and a specific HCoV. The GSEA score, ranging from 0 to 3, is the number of data sets that met these criteria for a specific drug. Mesalazine (an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease), sirolimus (an approved immunosuppressive drug), and equilin (an approved agonist of the estrogen receptor for menopausal symptoms) achieved the highest GSEA scores of 3, followed by paroxetine and melatonin with GSEA scores of 2. We next selected 16 potential repurposable drugs ( Figure 5A and Table 1 ) against HCoVs using subject matter expertise based on a combination of factors: (i) strength of the network-predicted associations (a smaller network proximity score in Supplementary Table S4 ); (ii) validation by GSEA analyses;.

An overexpression of estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication [34] .SERMs have been reported to play a broader role in inhibiting viral replication through the non-classical pathways associated with estrogen receptor [34] . SERMs interfere at the post viral entry step and affect the triggering of fusion, as the SERMs' antiviral activity still can be observed in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression [17] .Toremifene (Z = -3.23, Figure 5A ), the first generation of nonsteroidal SERM, exhibits potential effects in blocking various viral infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus in established cell lines [16, 35] . Interestingly, different from the classical ESR1-related antiviral pathway, toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein, and eventually inhibiting viral replication [36] . As shown in Figure 5B , toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with HCoV, such as RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I, EIF3F, and EIF3E [37, 38] . Equilin (Z = -2.52 and GSEA score = 3), an estrogenic steroid produced by horses, also has been proven to have moderate activity in inhibiting the entry of Zaire Ebola virus-glycoprotein and human immunodeficiency virus (ZEBOV-GP/HIV) [17] . Altogether, network-predicted SERMs (such as toremifene and equilin) offer potential repurposable candidates for HCoVs.with viral infection, including HCoVs [39] [40] [41] .

Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between Irbesartan's targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Figure 5C , irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus inhibiting viral entry [42, 43] . SLC10A1 interacts with C11orf74, a potential transcriptional repressor that interacts with nsp-10 of SARS-CoV [44] . There are several other ARBs (such as eletriptan, frovatriptan, and zolmitriptan) in which their targets are potentially associated with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome.confirmed the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as the key factor in regulating various viruses' replications, including Andes orthohantavirus and coronavirus [45, 46] . Sirolimus (Z = -2.35 and GSEA score = 3), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was reported to effectively block viral protein expression and virion release effectively [47] . Indeed, the latest study revealed the clinical application: sirolimus reduced MERS-CoV infection by over 60% [48] . Moreover, sirolimus usage in managing patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure can improve those patients' prognosis significantly [47] . Mercaptopurine (Z = -2.44 and GSEA score = 1), an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property, has been used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn's disease [49] .

Mechanistically, mercaptopurine potentially target several host proteins in HCoVs, such as JUN, PABPC1, NPM1, and NCL [37, 52] (Figure 5D ).Anti-inflammatory agents. Inflammatory pathways play essential roles in viral infections [53, 54] . As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = -1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections [55, 56] . Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on multiple organ functions [57] . The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients' clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription [58, 59] . In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients' survival time, which may provide a chance for patients' immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Figure 5E , melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cellderived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus [60] .In summary, our network proximity analyses offer multiple putative repurposable drugs that target diverse cellular pathways for potential prevention and treatment of .

However, further preclinical experiments and clinical trials are required to verify the clinical benefits of these network-predicted candidates before clinical use.Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play an important role in treating various viral infections [61] . However, our ability to identify and validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both the large number of drug pairs and dosage combinations. In our recent study, we proposed a novel network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations [25] . Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, we found that a drug combination was therapeutically effective only if it was captured by the 'Complementary Exposure' pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the disease module, but target separate neighborhoods ( Figure 6A ). Here we sought to identify drug combinations that may provide a synergistic effect in treating HCoVs with welldefined mechanism-of-action by network analysis. For the 16 potential repurposable drugs ( Figure 5A) , we showcased three network-predicted candidate drug combinations in the potential treatment of HCoVs.Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties, has demonstrated to improves outcomes in patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure [47] . The mTOR signaling plays an essential role for MERS-CoV infection [62] . Dactinomycin, also known actinomycin D, is an approved RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various cancer . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263 doi: medRxiv preprinttypes. An early study showed that dactinomycin (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the growth of feline enteric CoV [63] . As shown in Figure 6B , our network analysis shows that sirolimus and dactinomycin synergistically target HCoV-associated host protein subnetwork by 'Complementary Exposure' pattern, offering potential combination regimens for treatment of HCoV. Specifically, sirolimus and dactinomycin may inhibit both mTOR signaling and RNA synthesis pathway (including DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B)) in HCoV infected cells ( Figure 6B ).Toremifene is the approved first generation nonsteroidal SERMs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer [64] . SERMs (including toremifene) inhibited Ebola virus infection [17] by interacting with and destabilizing the Ebola virus glycoprotein [36] . In vitro assays have demonstrated that toremifene inhibited growth of MERS-CoV [16, 65] and SARA-CoV [35] (Table 1) . Emodin, an anthraquinone derivative extracted from the roots of rheum tanguticum, have been reported to have various anti-virus effects. Specifically, emdoin inhibited SARS-CoV associated 3a protein [66] , and blocked an interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 [67] . Altogether, network analyses and published experimental data suggested that combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for HCoVs ( Figure 6C ). Figure 5A , targets of both mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease [50, 51] . Melatonin was reported in potential treatment of .

Melatonin indirectly regulates ACE2 expression, a key entry receptor involved in viral infection of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV [31] . JUN, also known as c-Jun, is a key host protein involving in HCoV infectious bronchitis virus [68] . As shown in Figure 6D , mercaptopurine and melatonin may synergistically block c-Jun signaling by targeting multiple cellular targets.In summary, combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential combination therapy for 2019-nCoV by synergistically targeting papain-like protease, ACE2, c-Jun signaling, and anti-inflammatory pathways ( Figure 6D) . However, further experimental and clinical validations are highly warranted.In this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of HCoV.Integration of drug-target networks, HCoV-host interactions, HCoV-induced transcriptome in human cell lines, and human protein-protein interactome network are essential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16 putative repurposable drugs ( Figure 5 ) and 3 putative drug combinations (Figure 6 ) for the potential treatment of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV. However, all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in preclinical models and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients.We acknowledge several limitations in our current study. In this study, we used a low binding affinity value of 10 µM as a threshold to define a physical drug-target . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263 doi: medRxiv preprint interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1µM) may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug-target network.Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large-scale, experimentally reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug-protein interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. We may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further [24, 69] . In addition, the collected virus-host interactions are far from complete and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for HCoVs using sequence-based and structure-based approaches [70] . The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles [71] , as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists versus agonists). Comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays [72, 73] , will significantly improve the accuracy of current network-based methodologies.Owing to lack of the complete drug target information (such as the molecular 'promiscuity' of drugs), the dose-response and dose-toxicity effects for both repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in current network models. For example, Mesalazine, an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is .

Yet, several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) associated with mesalazine usage [74, 75] . Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework [25] .However, we expect that our methodology reminds to be a useful network-based tools for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs' targets with the HCoV-host subnetwork in the human interactome.Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir [76] ) with the networkpredicted repurposable drugs (Figure 5 ) or drug combinations (Figure 6 ) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework.In conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrated network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of HCoV. Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other types of virus and human diseases as well..

Whole genome alignment and protein sequence identity calculation were performed by Multiple Sequence Alignment in EMBL-EBI database with default parameters. The neighbor joining (NJ) tree was computed from the pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix using MEGA X [77] with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The protein alignment and phylogenetic tree of HCoVs were constructed by MEGA X.We collected HCoV-host protein interactions from various literatures based on our sizeable efforts. The HCoV-associated host proteins of several HCoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, MHV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 were pooled. These proteins were either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or were involved in critical pathways of HCoV infection identified by multiple experimental sources, including high throughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, viral protein pull-down assay, in vitro coimmunoprecipitation and RNA knock down experiment. In total, the virus-host interaction network included 6 HCoVs with 119 host proteins (Supplementary Table   S3 )..

All functional analyses were performed using Enrichr [78] .Here, we collected drug-target interaction information from the DrugBank database (v4.3) [79] , Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) [80] , PharmGKB database, ChEMBL (v20) [81] , BindingDB [82] , and IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY [83] . The chemical structure of each drug with SMILES format was extracted from DrugBank [79] . Here, only drug-target interactions meeting the following three criteria were used: (i) binding affinities, including Ki, Kd, IC50 or EC50 each ≤ 10 μM; (ii) the target was marked as 'reviewed' in the UniProt database [84] ; and (iii) the human target was represented by a unique UniProt accession number. The details for building the experimentally validated drug-target network are provided in our recent study [12] .To build a comprehensive list of human PPIs, we assembled data from a total of 18 bioinformatics and systems biology databases with five types of experimental .

All inferred data, including evolutionary analysis, gene expression data, and metabolic associations, were excluded. The genes were mapped to their Entrez ID based on the NCBI database [85] as well as their official gene symbols based on GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/). In total, the resulting human protein-protein interactome used in this study includes 351,444 unique PPIs (edges or links) connecting 17,706 proteins (nodes), representing a 50% increase in the number of the PPIs we have used previously. Detailed descriptions for building the human protein-protein interactome are provided in our previous studies [12, 86, 87] .We posit that the human PPIs provide an unbiased, rational roadmap for repurposing drugs for potential treatment of HCoVs in which they were not originally approved.Given , the set of host genes associated with a specific HCoV, and , the set of drug targets, we computed the network proximity of with the target set of each drug using the ""closest"" method: .

The network proximity was converted to Z-score based on permutation tests:where E CCC and E were the mean and standard deviation of the permutation test repeated 1,000 times, each time with two randomly selected gene lists with similar degree distributions to those of and . The corresponding P value was calculated based on the permutation test results. Z-score < -1.5 and P < 0.05 were considered significantly proximal drug-HCoV associations. All networks were visualized using Gephi 0.9.2 (https://gephi.org/).For this network-based approach for drug combinations to be effective, we need to establish if the topological relationship between two drug-target modules reflects biological and pharmacological relationships, while also quantifying their network-based relationship between drug-targets and HCoV-associated host proteins (drug-drug-HCoV combinations). To identify potential drug combinations, we combined the top lists of drugs. Then, ""separation"" measure HI was calculated for each pair of drugs and using the following method:.

Our key methodology is that a drug combination is therapeutically effective only if it follows a specific relationship to the disease module, as captured by Complementary Exposure patterns in targets' modules of both drugs without overlapping toxic mechanisms. [25] We performed the gene set enrichment analysis as an additional prioritization method.We first collected three differential gene expression data sets of hosts infected by HCoVs from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Among them, two transcriptome data sets were SARS-CoV infected samples from patient's peripheral blood [88] (GSE1739) and Calu-3 cells [89] (GSE33267) respectively. One transcriptome data set was MERS-CoV infected Calu-3 cells [90] (GSE122876). Adjusted P value less than 0.01 was defined as differentially expressed genes. These data sets were used as HCoV host signatures to evaluate the treatment effects of drugs. Differential gene expression in cells treated with various drugs were retrieved from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [33] , and were used as gene profiles for the drugs. For each drug that was in both the CMAP data set and our drug-target network, we calculated an enrichment score (ES) for each HCoV signature data set based on previously described methods [91] as follows:.

xtmozkf6,"ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism","expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.Patients infected by 2019-nCoV can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis.

Furthermore, positive 2019-nCoV was detected from the stools of a patient with loose of bowel movement in the United States [3] .There have been many studies on the proteins associated with host entry by the SARS-CoV.Cleavage of Spike protein by tissue factor Xa is required for the infectivity of SARS-CoV [4] .Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant used to combat acute pulmonary embolism with or without deep-vein thrombosis [5] . As an Xa inhibitor, it may thus offer protection for 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV receptor [6] . It also has been linked to 2019-nCoV infection; ACE2 interacts with the Spike protein and mediates 2019-nCoV infection of the type II alveolar cells of the lung [7] .Paradoxically, although ACE2 mediates viral entry to the host, its deficiency worsens lung injury by activating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in experimental models [6] . The circulating RAS regulates blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Local tissue-based RAS exacerbates pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury and experimental lung fibrosis [8] . Thus, blocking of the Angiotensin II receptor type I (AT1R) was associated with reduced SARS-CoV spike protein mediated lung injury [6] and reduced pulmonary hypertension in experimental models [9] . The AT1R blocker valsartan has recently been reported to improve clinical outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated with pulmonary hypertension (DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress-2019.PA2469).

In supportive of the view that ACE2 expression prevents intestinal inflammation [11, 12] , bioinformatic analysis suggested that genes regulating type I and type III innate immunity, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity and energy metabolism are positively associated with ACE2 expression.

g5wpa2ee,Potentially highly potent drugs for 2019-nCoV,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 and has rapidly spread around the world. By Feb 5, 2020, more than 24000 individuals were infected and more than 490 fatalities had been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no specific antiviral drug for this epidemic. Considering the severity of this widespread dissemination and health threats, panic patients misled by media flocked to the pharmacies for Chinese Medicine herbs which were reported to ""inhibit"" the 2019-nCoV, despite no clinical evidence supporting the claim. Many researchers are engaged in developing anti-2019-nCoV drug s [1, 2] . However, new drug discovery and development is a long, costly and rigorous scientific process. A more effective approach is to search for anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drug database.Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing), which concerns the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic target indications, has emerged as a successful strategy for drug discovery due to the reduced costs and expedited approval procedures [3] [4] [5] . Several successful examples unveil its great values in practice: Nelfinavir, initially developed to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is now being used for cancer treatments. Amantadine was firstly designed to treat influenza caused by type A influenza viral infection and is being used for Parkinson's disease later on [6] . In recent years, the rapid growth of drug-related datasets, as well as open data initiatives, has led to new developments for computational drug repositioning, particularly, structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Machine learning, network analysis, and text mining and semantic inference are three major computational approaches commonly applied in drug repositioning [7] . The rapid accumulation of genetic and structural databases [8] , the development of low-dimensional mathematical representations of complex biomolecular structures [9, 10] , and the availability of advanced deep learning algorithms have made machine learning-based drug reposition a promising approach [7] . Considering the urgent need for anti-2019-nCoV drugs, a computational drug repositioning is one of the most feasible strategies for discovering 2019-nCoV drugs.In SBDR, one needs to select one or a few effective targets. Study shows that 2019-nCoV genome is very close to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [11] . The sequence identities of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease, RNA polymerase, and the spike protein with corresponding SARS-CoV proteins are 96.08%, 96%, and 76%, respectively [12] . We, therefore, hypothesize that a potent SARS 3CL protease inhibitor is also a potent 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibitor. Unfortunately, there is no effective SARS therapy at present. Nevertheless, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS 3CL protease has been reported [13] and the binding affinities of 115 potential SARS 3CL protease inhibitors are available in ChEMBL database [14] . Additionally, there are 15,843 protein-ligand complexes in PDBbind 2018 general set with binding affinities and X-ray crystal structures [15] . Moreover, the DrugBank contains about 1600 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [16] . The aforementioned information provides a sound foundation to develop an SBDR machine learning model for 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibition.Recently, we have developed low-dimensional mathematical representations [9, 10] to reduce the structural complexity of macromolecules based on abstract mathematics, such as algebraic topology [17] [18] [19] [20] , differential geometry, and spectral graph theory [10, 21] . We exploit these representations to extract critical chemical and biological information for protein-ligand pose selection, binding affinity ranking, prediction, ranking, scoring, and screening [9, 10] . Paired with various machine learning, including deep algorithms, these approaches are the top competitor for D3R Grand Challenges, a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design in the past few years [22, 23] .In responding to the pressing need for anti-2019-nCoV medications, we develop mathematics-based deep learning models to systematically eventuate FDA approved drugs in the DrugBank for 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibition. With the consensus of two deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks and multitask deep learning, we report the top 15 potentially highly potent anti-2019-nCoV 3CL inhibitors, which provide timely guidance for the further development of anti-2019nCoV drugs.The sequence identity is defined as the percentage of characters that match exactly between two different sequences. The sequence identities between 2019-nCoV protease and the protease of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, HCoVNL63, 229E, and HIV are 96.1%, 52.0%, 49.0%, 48.4%, 45.2%, 41.9%, and 23.7%, respectively. It is seen that 2019-nCoV protease is very close to SARS-CoV protease, but is distinguished from other proteases. Clearly, 2019-nCoV has a strong genetic relationship with SARS-CoV, the sequence alignment in Figure 1 further confirms their relationship. Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease. Since the sequences are highly identical, the 2019-nCoV protease structure can be built by homology modeling with the SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2A5I) [13] as a template. It turns out, as shown in Fig. 2 , the homology structure of the 2019-nCoV protease is essentially identical to the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Particularly, the RMSD of two structures at the binding site is 0.21Å. The high structural similarity between the two proteases suggests that anti-SARS-CoV chemicals can be equally effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV.We predict the binding affinities of 1465 3D FDA-approved drugs and 2019-nCoV protease complexes using two models, 3DALL and 3DMT. 3DALL is built with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the algebraic topology-based representation of protein-ligand complexes, with 84 SARS-CoV protease inhibitors and 15843 complexes from the PDBbind 2018 general set as the training set. 3DMT, a deep 3 author/funder.

A complete list of predicted binding affinities of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is given in the Supplementary Material.We briefly describe the predicted potentially highly potent anti-2019-nCoV drugs. The most potent one is Bortezomib, an anti-cancer medication, which is known as proteasome inhibitor and can be used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.

The third one, Ponatinib, an oral drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is important to notice that this drug has the risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels. The next one is Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor for the treatment of primary kidney cancer and liver cancer. The fifth drug, Dasatinib, is a therapy for treating certain cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The next one, Paramethasone, is a glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. The seventh drug is Clocortolone, a topical steroid that is used in the form of an ester, clocortolone pivalate. It is interesting to note that this drug is always applied as a cream for the treatment of dermatitis. It is considered a medium-strength corticosteroid. Therefore, this drug might be used to clean 2019-nCoV contaminated materials, offering an extra layer of protection. The number eight drug, Flucloxacillin, is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. It is used to treat infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria. The next one, Sertindole, is an antipsychotic medication. The number ten drug, Clevidipine, is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that used for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. The eleventh drug, Aprepitant, is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting. The number twelve, Atorvastatin, is a statin drug used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treat abnormal lipid levels. The next drug is Cinolazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. The number fourteen drug, Clofazimine, is used together with rifampicin and dapsone to treat leprosy. The fifteenth number drug, Fosaprepitant, is an antiemetic medication used in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment.The top-ranking candidate of the existing drugs is Bortezomib (see Figure 3 (b)). Its predicted binding affinity to the nCoV-2019 protease is -12.29 kcal/mol. The high binding affinity is due to the strong hydrogen bond network formed between the drug and the nCoV-2019 protease.

The strong hydrogen bonds between this molecule and the protease are formed by five different H atoms on the head of the drug with four different O atoms in the main chains of Phe140 , Leu141, as well as the side 6 author/funder.

Another important bond is formed by the H atom in the amino of the side chain of Gln189 with the F atom of the fluorobenzene and one N atom of the 1,4-diazepane in the drug. Additionally, the O atom in the drug adjacent to the 1,4-diazepane is bonded with the amino H atom of the side chain of Glu166. Therefore, the head, tail, and body of the molecule are firmly fixed to the binding site, which promises a strong binding to the 2019-nCoV protease.The third one, Ponatinib (see Figure 3 It is interesting to analyze the predicted binding affinities of existing antiviral drugs developed as protease inhibitors. Their binding affinities are listed in Table 2 . It is interesting to see that except for Boceprevir, which is a protease inhibitor used to treat hepatitis caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the rest of protease inhibitors do not have a strong effect on 2019-nCoV. The predicted values by a recent study [24] are given in the parenthesis. It appears that these values are overestimated. Our deep learning-based drug repositioning models employ mathematical pose (MathPose) and mathematical deep learning (MathDL) to predict 3D poses and protein-ligand binding affinities. The latter is used as a major criterion for searching anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drugs. We first build a 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure by using homology modeling. A set of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using our MathPose. The resulting complexes are used as a set of machine learning training. Additionally, a set of protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind database is collected as another machine learning training set. Our training accuracy in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient is higher than 0.99 in all deep learning models.Homology modeling, a procedure that constructs an atomic-resolution model of a protein from its amino acid sequence and experimental 3D structure of the related homologous protein, i.e., the ""template,"" is used to generate the 3D structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. The SWISS model (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) is employed with the protease structure of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 2A5I [13] ) as a template. The sequence identity between the 3CL proteases of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV is 96.08%.ChEMBL [14] , an open database that brings chemical, bioactivity, and genomic data together to translate genomic information into effective new drugs, is employed to construct our 2019-nCoV training set. Considering the high sequence identity between viral proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, we take the protease of SARS-CoV as the input target in ChEMBL and a total 115 ChEMBL IDs of the target can be found. The experimental ∆G values of 2019-nCoV 115 SARS-CoV protease inhibition compounds range from −10.0 kcal/mol to 7.5 kcal/mol. We exclude compounds with positive values, resulting in a total of 84 SARS-nCoV protease inhibition compounds for our machine learning training. A collection of these 84 compounds is given in the Supplementary Materials.The PDBbind database is a yearly updated collection of experimentally measured binding affinity data (Kd, Ki, and IC50) for the protein-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDBbind general set, instead of the high-quality refined set, is chosen as our training set because of the FDA approved drugs involve a wide range of protein targets. In the current work, we use a set of 15,843 X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes and associated binding affinities from the PDBbind v2018 general set [15] . The information of these complexes is provided in the Supplementary Materials.DrugBank (www.drugbank.ca) is a richly annotated, freely accessible online database that integrates massive drug, drug target, drug action, and drug interaction information about FDA-approved drugs with the experimental drugs which are going through the FDA approval process [16] . Due to the high quality and sufficient information contained in, the DrugBank has become one of the most popular reference drug author/funder. All rights reserved.

A total of 1553 FDA-approved drugs are contained in the DrugBank. However, in the present work, a number of FDA-approved drugs encountered difficulties in docking with the target molecule. Therefore, the MathPose successfully created 3D protein-ligand complex structures for 1465 FDA-approved drugs and 2019-nCoV protease. MathDL, designed for predicting various druggable properties of 3D molecules [23] , is capable of efficiently and accurately encoding the high-dimensional biomolecular interactions into low-dimensional representations. Algebraic graph theory-based algorithms [25] , differential geometry, and algebraic topology methods [23] are applied to generate three mathematical representations of data in MathDL. These data representations can be integrated with well-designed deep learning models, such as gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for pose ranking and binding affinity predictions. In D3R Grand Challenges (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge), a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design, MathDL had been proved as the top performer in free energy prediction and ranking [22, 23] . Figure 4 illustrates the framework of the MathDL model, which combined the aforementioned mathematical representations with the CNN architecture for druggable properties predictions. The PDBbind 2018 general set [15] , along with the SARS 3CL protease related dataset is used in our training process. In this section, we briefly describe the algebraic topology representation used in the present work. Details can be found in the literature [23] .Even with a glimpse of topology, one can realize it dramatically simplifies geometric complexity [9, [17] [18] [19] [20] . The study of topology reveals characterizes of different dimensions. As a type of algebraic topology, 9 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Separated components, rings, and cavities can be classified for a given configuration and their numbers are referred to as Betti-0, Betti-1, and Betti-2, respectively. In this topological analysis process, the metrics or coordinates are fully abandoned. Instead, geometric and topological information is captured as data representation. Moreover, as a new development branch of algebraic topology, persistent homology which combines multiscale geometric information and topological invariants to achieve a geometry-enriched topological characteristic, e.g., barcodes. Therefore, the ""birth"" and ""death"" of separated components, circles, rings, voids or cavities can be indicated at all spatial scales by topological measurements. Key concepts are briefly shown as following.In algebraic topology, simplices are the essential building blocks. Let v 0 , v 1 , v 2 , · · · , v k be k +1 affinely independent points. A (geometric) k-simplex σ k is the linear combinations of these points in R n (n ≥ k), whose coefficients are positive and satisfy that their summation equals to 1. For example, a 0, 1, 2, or 3simplex is considered as a vertex, an edge, a triangle, or a tetrahedron, respectively. A simplicial complex K is a topological space composed of simplices which satisfies that every face of a simplex σ k ∈ K is also in K and the non-empty intersection of any two simplices is a face for both. To identify the homology group, a k-chain [σ k ] is a summation i α i σ k i of k-simplices σ k i , and the set of all k-chains of the simplicial complex K equipped with an algebraic field (typically, Z 2 ) forms an abelian group C k (K, Z 2 ). The homology defined on a series of abelian groups is used to analyze topological invariants which requires boundary operators to connect these chain spaces. The boundary operators ∂ k :Consequently, a important property of boundary operator, ∂ k−1 ∂ k = ∅, follows from that boundaries are boundaryless. The algebraic construction to connect a sequence of complexes by boundary maps is called a chain complexand the kth homology group is the quotient group defined bywhere the k-cycle group Z k and the k-boundary group B k are the subgroups of C k defined as,The aforementioned property implies B k ⊆ Z k ⊆ C k . The Betti numbers are defined by the ranks of kth homology group H k which counts k-dimensional holes, especially, β 0 = rank(H 0 ) reflects the number of connected components, β 1 = rank(H 1 ) reflects the number of loops, and β 2 = rank(H 2 ) reveals the number of voids or cavities. Together, the set of Betti numbers {β 0 , β 1 , β 2 , · · · } indicates the intrinsic topological property of a system.Persistent homology [18] is devised to track the multiscale topological information over different scales along a filtration. A filtration of a topology space K is a nested sequence of subspaces {K t } t=0,...,m of K such that ∅ = K 0 ⊆ K 1 ⊆ K 2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ K m = K. Moreover, on this complex sequence, we obtain a sequence of chain complexes by homomorphisms: C * (K 0 ) → C * (K 1 ) → · · · → C * (K m ) and a homology sequence:where B t+p k = im∂ k+1 (K t+p ). Intuitively, this homology group records the homology classes of K t that are persistent at least until K t+p . Under the filtration process, the persistent homology barcodes can be generated. To make use of advanced deep learning algorithms, we vectorize persistent homology barcodes by dividing them into bins and calculating persistence, birth, and death incidents in each bin. Furthermore, the statistics of element-specific persistent homology barcodes are taken into consideration as well in fixedlength features.MathPose, a 3D pose predictor which converts SMILES strings into 3D poses with references of target molecules, was the top performer in D3R Grand Challenge 4 in predicting the poses of 24 beta-secretase 1 (BACE) binders [23] . For one SMILES string, around 1000 3D structures can be generated by a common docking software tool, i.e., GLIDE [27] . Moreover, a selected set of known complexes is re-docked by the three docking software packages mentioned above to generate at 100 decoy complexes per input ligand as a machine learning training set. The machine learning labels will be the calculated root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) between the decoy and native structures for this training set. Furthermore, MathDL models will be set up and applied to select the top-ranked pose for the given ligand. Additionally, the top poses will be fed into the MathDL for druggable proprieties evaluation.The current pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), called 2019-nCoV in China, has evolved into a global health emergency declared by the World Health Organization. Although there is no effective anti-viral medicine for the 2019-nCoV, the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have a sequence identity of 96%, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. We build a three-dimensional (3D) 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using a SARS-CoV 3CL protease crystal structure as a template and collect a set of 84 SARS-CoV inhibition experimental data. The molecules of this set are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure to form a machine learning training set. Additionally, the PDBbind 2018 general set of 15,843 protein-ligand complexes is also included as an additional machine learning training set. Using these training sets, we develop two deep learning models based on low-dimensional algebraic topology representations of macromolecular complexes. A total of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is evaluated by their binding affinities predicted by the consensus of two models built with 1) a combination of algebraic topology and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 2) a combination of algebraic topology and deep multitask CNNs. According to the predicted binding affinities, we recommend many FDA-approved drugs as potentially highly potent medications to 2019-nCoV, which serve as a crucial step for the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs.Supplementary Materials are available online for 3D structure information and affinities of SARS-CoV inhibitors, FDA-approved drugs, and PDBbind data set. author/funder.

xhachzby,X-ray Structure of Main Protease of the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Enables Design of α-Ketoamide Inhibitors,"Since December 2019, a new coronavirus has been emerging in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. Whereas at the beginning of the outbreak, cases were connected to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan, efficient human-to-human transmission led to exponential growth in the number of cases, with the count standing at >71,000 as of today, with a ~2.4% case-fatality rate. The RNA genome of 2019-nCoV features an identity of about 82% to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); both viruses belong to clade b of the genus Betacoronavirus.Hence, it has been proposed to rename the new virus as SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) .One of the best characterized drug targets among coronaviruses is the main protease (M pro , also called 3CL pro ). Along with the papain-like protease(s), this enzyme is essential for processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA (Hilgenfeld, 2014) . The M pro operates at no less than 11 cleavage sites on the large polyprotein 1ab (replicase 1ab, ~790 kDa); the recognition sequence at most sites is Leu -Gln¯(Ser,Ala,Gly) (¯ marks the cleavage site). Inhibiting the activity of this enzyme will block viral replication. Since no human proteases with a similar cleavage specificity are known, chances are that inhibitors will exhibit low toxicity.Here we report the crystal structure of the M pro of 2019-nCoV in the unliganded form and the usage of this structure to design new a-ketoamide inhibitors, compounds 13a and 13b. These compounds were developed on the basis of our first-generation peptidomimetic a-ketoamides, which we designed as broad-spectrum antivirals targeting the M pro s of beta-CoVs and alpha-CoVs, as well as the 3C protease of enteroviruses . Compared to other inhibitors of cysteine proteases, a-ketoamides have the advantage of bearing a relatively mild electrophilic author/funder. All rights reserved.

The r.m.s. deviation between the two free-enzyme structures is 0.53 Å for all Ca positions of the molecule but the isolated domains exhibit r.m.s. deviations of only 0.31 Å (domain II) -0.42 Å (domains I, III) (comparison between the novel coronavirus M pro structure and SARS-CoV M pro , PDB entry 2BX4 (Tan et al., 2005) ). The chymotrypsin-and picornavirus 3C protease-like domains I and II (residues 10-99 and 100-182, respectively) are six-stranded antiparallel b-barrels that harbor the substrate-binding site between them. Domain III (residues 198-303), a globular cluster of five helices, is involved in the regulation of dimer formation of the M pro (Shi & Song, 2006) . 2019-nCoV M pro forms a tight dimer (contact interface, predominantly between domain II of molecule A and the NH2-terminal residues of molecule B (""N-finger""): ~1394 Å 2 ), with the two molecules oriented perpendicular to one another ( Fig. 1) . Dimerization of the enzyme is necessary for catalytic activity, because the N-finger of each of the two protomers interacts with Glu 166 of the other protomer and thereby helps shape the S1 pocket of the substrate-binding site (Anand et al., 2002) . To reach this interaction site, the N-finger is squeezed in between domains II and III of the parent monomer and domain II of the other monomer. Interestingly, in the SARS-CoV but not in the 2019-nCoV M pro dimer, there is a polar interaction between the two domains III involving a 2.60-Å hydrogen bond between the side-chain hydroxyl groups of residue Thr 285 of each author/funder.

It has previously been shown that replacing Ser 284 , Thr 285 , and Ile 286 by alanine residues in SARS-CoV M pro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the protease, concomitant with a slightly closer packing of the two domains III of the dimer against one another (Lim et al., 2014) . According to that study, this is accompanied by changes of the structural dynamics of the enzyme that transmit the effect of the mutation to the catalytic center. Indeed, the Thr 285 Ala replacement observed in the 2019-nCoV M pro also allows the two domains III to approach each other a little closer (the distance between the Ca atoms of residues 285 in molecules A and B is 6.77 Å in SARS-CoV M pro and 5.21 Å in 2019-nCoV M pro and the distance between the centers of mass of the two domains III shrinks from 33.4 Å to 32.1 Å).

Chain termini are labeled N and C for molecule A (light blue) and N* and C* for molecule B (orange).In the active site of 2019-nCoV M pro , Cys 145 and His 41 form a catalytic dyad. Like in SARS-CoV M pro and other coronavirus homologues, a buried water molecule is found hydrogen-bonded to His 41 ; this could be considered the third component of a catalytic triad.Scheme 1: Chemical structures of a-ketoamide inhibitors 11r, 13a, and 13bPreviously, we have designed and synthesized peptidomimetic a-ketoamides as broadspectrum inhibitors of the main proteases of betacoronaviruses and alphacoronaviruses as well as the 3C proteases of enteroviruses . The best of these compounds (11r; see Scheme 1) showed an EC50 of 400 picomolar against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells as well as low micromolar EC50 values against SARS-CoV and a whole range of enteroviruses in various cell lines.In order to improve the half-life and the solubility of the compounds in human plasma, and to reduce the binding to plasma proteins, we have modified the compound by hiding the P3 -P2 amide bond within a pyridone ring and by replacing the cinnamoyl group. For a compound related to 11r but modified this way (compound 13a), the half-life in human plasma was increased by 50%, solubility was improved, and plasma protein binding was reduced from 99% to 94%.

In addition, 13a showed good metabolic stability using mouse and human microsomes, with intrinsic clearance rates Cl int_mouse = 32.00 µL/min/mg protein and Cl int_human = 20.97 µL/min/mg protein. This means that after 30 min, around 80% for mouse and 60% for humans, respectively, of residual compound remained metabolically stable. Pharmacokinetic studies in CD-1 mice using the subcutaneous route at 20 mg/kg showed that 13a stayed in plasma for up to only 4 hrs, but was excreted via urine up to 24 hrs. The Cmax was determined at 334.50 ng/mL and the mean residence time was about 1.59 hrs. Although 13a seemed to be cleared very rapidly from plasma, it was found at 24 hrs at 135 ng/g tissue in the lung and at 52.7 ng/mL in broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) suggesting that it was mainly distributed to tissue. In the light of the current CoV outbreak, it is advisable to develop compounds with lung tropism such as 13a. However, compared to 11r, the structural modification led to some loss of inhibitory activity against the main protease of 2019-nCoV (IC50 = 2.39 ± 0.63 uM) as well as the 3C proteases of enteroviruses. To enhance the antiviral activity against betacoronaviruses of clade b (2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV), we sacrificed the goal of broad-spectrum activity including the enteroviruses for the time being and replaced the P2 cyclohexyl moiety of 13a by cyclopropyl in 13b, because the S2 pocket of the betacoronavirus main proteases shows a pronounced plasticity enabling it to adapt to the shape of smaller inhibitor moieties entering this site . Here we present X-ray crystal structures in two different crystal forms, at 1.95 and 2.20 Å resolution, of the complex between aketoamide 13b optimized this way and the M pro of 2019-nCoV (Fig. 2) . One structure is in space group C2, where both protomers of the M pro dimer are bound by crystal symmetry to have identical conformations, the other is in space group P212121, where the two protomers are independent of each other and free to adopt different conformations. Indeed, we find that in the latter crystal structure, the key residue Glu 166 adopts an inactive conformation (as evidenced by its prolonged author/funder. All rights reserved.

This phenomenon has also been observed, in a more pronounced form, with the SARS-CoV M pro (Yang et al., 2003) and is consistent with the half-site activity described for this enzyme (Chen et al., 2006) .

This is clearly reflected in the electron density (Fig. 2) ; the stereochemistry of this chiral moiety is S in all three copies of compound 13b in these structures. The oxyanion (or hydroxyl) group of this thiohemiketal is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from His 41 , whereas the amide oxygen of 13b accepts a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amides of Gly 143 , Cys 145 , and partly Ser 144 , which form the canonical ""oxyanion hole"" of the cysteine protease. The P1 g-lactam moiety, designed as a glutamine surrogate (Dragovich et al., 1999; Tan et al., 2013) , is deeply embedded in the S1 pocket of the protease, where the lactam amide nitrogen donates a three-center (bifurcated) hydrogen bond to the main-chain oxygen of Phe 140 (3.20/3.10/3.28 Å; values for the structure in space group C2/space group P212121 molecule A/space group P212121 molecule B) and to the Glu 166 carboxylate (3.35/3.33/ -Å), and the carbonyl oxygen accepts a 2.57/2.51/2.81-Å H-bond from the imidazole of His 163 . The P2 cyclopropyl methyl moiety is embraced by the S2 subsite, which has shrunk by 28.4 Å 3 compared to a complex between compound 13a with P2 = cyclohexyl methyl and the SARS-CoV M pro (LLZ et al., unpublished) .The pyridone in the P3 position of the inhibitor occupies the space normally filled by the substrate's main chain, its carbonyl oxygen accepts a 2.89/2.99/3.00-Å hydrogen bond from the main-chain amide of residue Glu166. Further, the P3 amide donates a 2.83/2.96/2.87-Å H-bond to the mainchain oxygen of Glu 166 . Embedded within the pyridone, the P2 nitrogen can no longer donate a hydrogen bond to the protein; however, our previous crystal structures showed that the P2 mainchain amide of the linear a-ketoamides does not make a hydrogen bond with the protein in all cases, so this interaction does not seem to be essential . The Boc group does not occupy the canonical S4 site of the protease, but is located near Pro 168 (at a distance of author/funder. All rights reserved.

This contact explains that removing the Boc group weakens the inhibitory potency of this compound by a factor of about 2. Interestingly, there is a space between the pyridone ring of 13b, the main chain of residue Thr 190 , and the side-chain of Gln 189 , which is filled by a DMSO molecule in the C2 crystal structure and a water molecule in the P212121 structure.This suggests that P3 moieties more bulky than pyridone may be accepted here. As the next steps in the development of compound 13b towards a potential drug targeting 2019-nCoV or other coronaviruses, we will undertake tests in virus-infected cell cultures and in a small-animal model (once it will become available for 2019-nCoV). Meanwhile, our crystal structures may be used by others for virtual screening and de-novo design of inhibitors.Anand K., Palm G. J., Mesters J. R., Siddell S.

370fqkat,Correlation Analysis Between Disease Severity and Inflammation-related Parameters in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Critical patients should have any of the following conditions:1. Respiratory failure occurs and mechanical ventilation required; 2. Shock occurs;3. Combining other organ failure and requiring treatment in ICU.All tests were completed in the clinical laboratory in Tongji Hospital. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R), interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10 and TNFα were detected by Siemens chemiluminescence method and IL-6 were detected by Roche electrochemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instruction. The ultrasensitive CRP regent was provided by Nippon Denkasei Co., Ltd, and CRP was detected by immunoturbidimetry method. Ferroprotein was detected by Roche granule-enhanced immune turbidimetry. Procalcitonin (PCT) was detected by Roche electrochemiluminescence method. ESR was measured by Westergren's international standard method. Peripheral blood cell was detected by fluorescence staining flow cytometry, and we analyzed the differences of white blood cell (WBC), NC, LC and eosinophils (EC) among three groups.For data of normal distribution (IL2R, ESR, ferroprotein, WBC and NC), comparisons among critical, severe and mild groups were analyzed by ANOVA analysis. With different homogeneity of variance, the pairwise comparison between groups was performed using the Bonferroni test or Dunnett's T3 test. For non-normal distribution (CRP and LC), the data were conversed using square root, followed by ANOVA analysis and pairwise comparison. With data below the detectable limit, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, PCT, and EC, the data were ranked referring to the reference range and value rank (Table 1) ; then non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test were performed. In correlation analysis, Spearman correlation coefficient was used for the variables of normal distribution, Pearson correlation coefficient for those of skewed distribution, and Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient for ranked data..

Figure 1D and Table 2 showed that all IL-8 levels in mild and severe patients were within the reference range (<62 pg/mL), and there were significant differences between critical and severe patients or critical and mild group.With regard to IL-10 and TNFα, there was significant difference between mild and severe or mild and critical patients, and no significant difference was found between severe and critical group ( Figure 1E -F). With regard to cytokine IL-1β, no significant difference was found among three groups, and the data were not shown.In addition, levels of CRP, ferroprotein and PCT were statistically different among mild, severe and critical patients ( Figure Figure 2D ) indicated the best cut-off point was 2252μg/L with a specificity of 96.6% and a sensitivity of 52.2%. There was no statistical difference on ESR among three groups ( Figure 3D ).In peripheral blood cell analysis, there were significant differences in WBC count between the critical and severe groups or critical and mild groups, and no significance was found between the mild and severe groups ( Figure 4A ). ROC curve of WBC (AUC =0.838, p =0.000, Figure 2E ) suggested the best cut-off point was 7.92*10^9/L with 77% specificity and 78.1% sensitivity. If the detected values of WBC are above the upper reference limit, it often indicates infection. Because WBC count is influenced by therapy, clinically the upper limit of reference range of WBC, namely 9.5*10^9/L, seems more meaningful.NC was significantly different among the three groups ( Figure 4B ), and the average was 10.80*10^9/L in critical group, 5.47*10^9/L in severe group and 3.53 *10^9/L in mild group. ROC curve of NC (AUC=0.814, P=0.000, Figure 2F ) indicated the best cut-off point was 7.305*10^9/L with 85.2% specificity and 75% sensitivity. There was .

Many patients in each group had a decreased level of EC, and 0 EC was detected in 65.63% patients in critical group, 55.88% in severe group, and 25.93% in mild group. There were significant differences between severe and mild or critical and mild patients (Table 2, Figure 4D ). Table 3 (Table 3 ). There was no significant correlation on IL-1β, gender and ESR.The new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia outbreaking at the end of 2019 is highly contagious, with a crude mortality rate of about 2.3% [1] . Currently, more than 74677 patients have been reported in the Mainland of China. About 80.9% patients are with mild to moderate severity [1] , and with a better prognosis. However, for patients developing into severe or critical levels, the mortality rate was significantly increased, and crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients [1] . It plays key roles to identify severe and critical patients even earlier, aiming to improve the recovery rate and reduce mortality.Clinically, many patients appeared short-term progressive aggravation, scholars speculated that ""inflammatory storms"" occurred, namely, overreaction of cytokine. In a preprint article in medrxiv, the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines of 123 patients (102 mild and 21 severe patients) were analyzed and the researchers found the numbers of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreased, and the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 increased in severe cases [7] . In this study, a retrospective analysis was conducted about cytokines and other inflammatory indicators of 100 patients (including 66 severe or critical patients), and more indicators were expected to better identify critical patients and help clinical decision-making..

In addition, IL2R levels, ferroprotein levels, PCT levels, and EC counts were also related to the disease severity. Besides, we also found the IL-6 levels in mild patients were lower than 100pg/mL. For eight patients who were deceased in critical group, IL-6 level was >100pg/mL in three persons.IL-6 >100pg/mL might represent the emergence of ""inflammatory storm"". IL-8 levels in mild and severe patients were normal, and for patients with IL-8 >62 pg/mL, more attention need to avoid the disease progression. Based on clinical practice and ROC analysis between critical and non-critical patients, some cut-off values of the test items were obtained. With age >67.5 years, IL2R >793.5U/mL, CRP >30.7ng/mL, ferroprotein >2252μg/L, WBC >9.5*10^9/L or NC>7.305*10^9/L, progress to critical illness should be closely observed and prevented.Preventing recognition or blocking the occurrence of inflammatory action, new drugs development on immune regulation, might be new breakthroughs in the control of COVID-19 pneumonia. Pathological examination found lymphocyte-dominated mononuclear cell infiltration in interstitial pulmonary tissue, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced in peripheral blood cells, but a high ratio of CD38+ (CD4 3.47%) and HLA-DR+ (CD8 39.4%) T cells [9] , which suggested excessive activation of pro-inflammatory cells. Presumably, lymphocyte deposition in lung tissue might contribute to lymphocyte reduction in peripheral blood. In addition, researchers found that CCR4+ CCR6+ Th17 cells were increased, and the IL-17 inhibitor (Secukinumab) against activated Th17 cells is promising for disease control [9] . In this study, IL-6, TNFα and IL-8 may be potential targets for immunotherapy of COVID-19. With IL-6 >100pg/mL, the patient's condition was extremely critical. According to the news, a research team from First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China has used IL-6 receptor recombinant monoclonal antibody, Tozhu monoclonal antibody, in 14 critically or severely ill COVID-19 patients [10] .The results were reported to be encouraging.

qefiw4ho,Screening of FDA-approved drugs using a MERS-CoV clinical isolate from South Korea identifies potential therapeutic options for COVID-19,"patients in the late stage of infection (Omrani et al., 2014; Shalhoub et al., 2014; Spanakis et al., 2014) . These results suggest that the administration of broad-spectrum antivirals to MERS patients is effective at some points during infection, although a specific treatment for MERS-CoV may be required full antiviral activity.With the current severe outbreak of coronavirus disease emerging from Wuhan in China in late 2019, several countries worldwide battle to control the spread of this devastating virus.The ongoing outbreak is accompanied by many human casualties and significant socio-economic losses globally and has now reached the proportions of a pandemic, with more than 81,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases and more than 2,760 related fatalities worldwide (February 26, 2020) .Unfortunately, CoV-specific FDA-approved drugs are still not available in the clinics.In this study, to address the urgent unmet medical needs and to facilitate the development or identification of more appropriate and effective medical care for patients infected with CoV, we implemented a high-content screening (HCS) strategy with the goal of repurposing newly identified inhibitors for MERS-CoV and a wider range of CoV, including COVID-19, therapy. Utilizing a Korean MERS-CoV patient isolate, we screened 5,406 compounds containing United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, bioactives, kinase inhibitors, and natural products; our library included 60% of all FDA-approved drugs (1,247 out of 2,069 total) (Fig. 1A) . Compounds were tested for their anti-MERS-CoV activity by determining the levels of the viral spike (S) protein expression of infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). Screening was conducted in two-times independently (screen 1 and screen 2) using chloroquine as a reference inhibitor at 100 μM for the maximum inhibitory concentration (IC90 = 93 μM) (De Wilde et al., 2014) . The calculated Z'-factor of >0.78 indicated a good separation of infected cells treated with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control and chloroquine (Fig. 1B) . Two independent HCS analyses were further conducted (R 2 = 0.91) to select for hits that demonstrated a high degree of correlation between the two replicates. (Fig. 1C) . Primary hits were selected by choosing those that demonstrated >70% MERS-CoV the author/funder. All rights reserved.

These hits were then confirmed using 10-point DRC analysis; from these assays, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and 50% cytotoxicity concentrations (CC50) were determined for each compound (Fig. 1D . A representative example of a 10-point DRC analysis is shown in Supplementary   Fig. 1 . Based on this analysis, we regarded 35 compounds with a therapeutic index (TI ratio of CC50/IC50) values <1 as inactive and eliminated these from the confirmed hits list, resulting in 221 confirmed hits and selected 54 final hits with an in vitro TI >6 for further testing (Fig. 1D ).Our approach aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs and bioactives that could be promptly repositioned or developed, respectively, to treat MERS-CoV and potentially COVID-19-infected patients. In previously reported studies, small molecule libraries, including approximately 300 drugs with FDA-approval or in clinical development, were screened against MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al., 2014; Dyall et al., 2014) . Here, our screening included 1,247 FDA-approved drugs, which covers approximately 60% of all FDA-approved compounds. As a result, we identified drugs that were not found in previous studies, indicating that there are still opportunities for identifying novel FDAapproved drugs and bioactives by screening larger compound libraries. Moreover, we corroborated four previously identified hits, including emetine dihydrochloride, ouabain, cycloheximide, and nelfinavir mesylate. This strongly suggests that despite the use of different viral isolates, both our HCS assays and previously published screens reproducibly identified drugs that could be repurposed as potential therapeutic options for patients suffering CoV infections (Dyall et al., 2014) .Next, using publicly available drug databases, we classified the entire compound library, as well as our final hit compounds, into 43 categories of distinct pharmacological actions. The results are shown in Fig. 2 , with the distribution of the entire library shown as gray bars, and the final hits indicated in black. Important to note, the cardiovascular agents' group contained 14 compounds with TI >6 (26% of final hits). From this analysis, we found that the majority of final hits are classified as cardiovascular agents (14 out of 54), belonging to a class of cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides the author/funder.

Notably, however, glycosides have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus (Bertol et al., 2011; Kapoor et al., 2012) . Consistent with these previous studies, our data indicate that the cardiac glycosides, ouabain, digitoxin, and digoxin, efficiently inhibit MERS-CoV infection. Ouabain, in particular, has been found to block the entry stage of coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, through Src kinase signaling (Burkard et al., 2015) . Based on these data, we speculate that cardiac glycosides may generally act as anti-MERS-CoV agents through blockage of viral entry. However, more experimental work will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which this occurs.FDA-approved drugs and inhibitors with known biological functions are particularly advantageous for repurposing due to their known pharmacological activities and safety profiles and potentially facilitate faster development of drugs, respectively. Therefore, we prioritized 12 FDAapproved drugs and six bioactives, which have not yet been reported to have anti-CoV activities and summarized the information in Table 1 and Table 2 To investigate whether the FDA-approved drugs act on the early-or late stages (pre-or post-entry) of the viral life cycle are inhibited, we conducted time-of-addition studies. Therefore, Vero cells were treated with each drug at a concentration higher than its IC90 value, at 1 h prior to, or at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h post-infection (hpi). Viral infection was then quantified by IFA, as previously described (infected cells treated with 0.5% DMSO were normalized to 100% infection). Chloroquine, which was used as an early stage inhibitor control inhibited MERS-CoV infection up to 30% until 3 hpi but had no significant effect when administered at 4 hpi (Fig. 3) .

In contrast, atovaquone, lercanidipine hydrochloride, permethrin, and octocrylene had only minor inhibitory effects throughout the time-course assay, indicating that these drugs likely act on later stages of the viral life cycle (Supplementary Fig. 2) .Notably, our results indicate that lercanidipine hydrochloride and benidipine hydrochloride, both of which are dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, display different patterns of viral inhibition (Epstein, 2001; Yao et al., 2006) . This observation could be explained by the types of calcium channels that each drug blocks; benidipine hydrochloride blocks triple voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitor, whereas lercanidipine hydrochloride blocks single voltage-gated channel (Klein and Köppel H, 1999; Ozawa et al., 2006; Wirtz and Herzig, 2004) .Together, we identified 12 FDA-approved drugs that could be considered for repositioning to MERS-CoV or COVID-19 therapy. Especially the cardiotonic drugs ouabain, digitoxin, or digoxin with a TI greater than 100 in monotherapy or combined with remdesivir, a drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, or with other therapeutics, might lead to drug synergism.However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to investigate the exact antiviral mechanisms, determine potential synergistic effects, and to confirm their antiviral efficacy in an animal model to prioritize and select drugs for potential use in patients affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

wx7nheay,Structure of Mpro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors,"kinetic analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1e ). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for COVID-19 72 virus M pro was measured to be 28,500 M −1 s −1 which is slightly higher than that for SARS- 73 CoV M pro (kcat/Km=26,500 M −1 s −1 ) 10 , but over 30-fold higher than that of human rhinovirus 74 3C protease (kcat/Km=920 M −1 s −1 ) 11 .In a previous study, we designed a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 using computer-aided 77 drug design (CADD) (Extended Data Fig. 1c) , which can specifically inhibit multiple CoV utilized to evaluate the inhibition as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate be 11,300±880 M -1 s -1 , suggesting this Michael acceptor has potent inhibition. 95 The crystal structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with N3 96 In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of this compound, we determined the crystal 97 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with N3 to 2.1-Å resolution. The asymmetric 98 unit contains only one polypeptide (Extended Data Table 1 ). However, two of these 99 associate to form a dimer by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (the two molecules 100 are designated protomer A and B) (Fig. 1b) . All residues (residues 1-306) are visible in 101 electron density maps. Each protomer is composed of three domains (Fig. 1a) . Domains Ⅰ 102 (residues 8-101) and Ⅱ (residues 102-184) have an antiparallel β-barrel structure. Domain 103 Ⅲ(residues 201-303) contains five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular 104 cluster, and is connected to domain Ⅱ by means of a long loop region (residues 185-200). strand155-168 on one side, and with residues 189-191 of the loop linking domains Ⅱ and Ⅲ. 111 Here we detail the specific interactions of N3 with M pro (Fig. 1c, d) . The electron density 112 shows that the Sγ atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-Å) with the Cβ of the vinyl 113 group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute 114 requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A, E166-A, H163-115 A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-A are involved 116 in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules (named W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163-118 A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic S2 subsite, which 119 consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl portion of the 120 side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, indicating that this the S1′ site, forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A and T25-A. In addition, N3 126 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding 127 pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the substrate-binding pocket. conformation. This may be attributed to an ordered water (W1) in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 133 structure, which makes a long distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the 134 ester and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143 and the side 135 chain of N142. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV M pro s share a highly 136 conserved substrate-recognition pocket, which could serve as a drug target for the design 137 of broad-spectrum inhibitors 12 . The recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of 138 structural data for CoV M pro s from various species provided the opportunity to further 139 examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of M pro s 12-21 have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain Ⅲ and surface loops, but the 141 substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains Ⅰ and Ⅱ are still highly 142 conserved among all CoV M pro s, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting this site should 143 have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 2b, c) . μM.

mp3a9c9u,Molecular Dynamics Simulations Indicate the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Is Not a Viable Target for Small-Molecule Inhibitors Design,"In December 2019, the first atypical pneumonia outbreak associated with the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in Wuhan, China 1 . In humans, coronaviruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, however, the rarer forms of coronaviruses can be lethal. Based on the genomic data analysis of SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. indicated that it is closely related to two SARS-CoV sequences isolated from bats in 2015 and 2017 2 . One of the key enzymes in the life cycle of coronaviruses is the main protease (Mpro). Together with non-structural proteins and the spike glycoprotein, it is essential for interactions between the virus and host cell receptors during viral entry 3 . While 12 residues differ between both coronaviruses, only one, namely S46 in SARS-CoV-2 (A46 in SARS-CoV), is located in the proximity of the entrance to the active site (Fig. 1A) . Such a small structural change would not be expected to substantially affect the binding of small molecules 4 and would suggest that repurposing SARS drugs against COVID-19 may be fruitful. To this day, several in silico attempts have been made, including a massive virtual screening (VS) for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors using Deep Docking 5 and only the clinically approved drugs [6] [7] [8] . Regrettably, as we show, this strategy is not likely to succeed.The structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros are highly similar. Both enzymes share the same structural composition; they consist of three domains: an antiparallel β-barrel comprising I and II domains, and the mostly helical III domain, which is required for the enzymatic activity 9 . Both enzymes resemble the structure of cysteine proteases, although their active site comprises a catalytic dyad, namely H41 and C145, and lacks the third catalytic residue replaced by a stable water molecule 10 . The localisation of local hot-spots of all 6 cosolvents (purple -urea, green -dimethylsulfoxide, yellow -methanol, orange -acetonitrile, pink -phenol, red -benzene) in the binding site cavity. (F) The distribution of two major groups of evolutionary correlated residues. (G) The potential mutability of the binding site residues reflected by the differences in Gibbs free energy of protein folding corresponding to the wild-type. On panels A-F the active site residues are shown as red sticks.A total of 2 µs classical molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros with different starting points were run to examine the plasticity of their binding cavities. The maximal accessible volume (MAV) of the binding cavities during the simulation time and the overall distribution of solvent in the protein's interior were inspected using ligand tracking approach 11 . Surprisingly, despite their high similarity (Fig. 1A) , the binding cavities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros show significantly different MAV. Both proteins reduce their MAV upon inhibitor binding approximately 20%, but the maximal volume of SARS-CoV is over 50% larger than those of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1B) . It is also worth noting that, despite the differences in size and shape between both Mpros binding cavities, the local solvent distribution approach always detects the highest water density next to the H41 residue, reflecting the position of a catalytic water of Mpro replacing the missing third catalytic site amino acid (Fig. 1B) . These findings 10 are supported by the movements of loops that regulate the active sites' accessibility in Mpros. We found that the C44-P52 loop of the SARS-CoV Mpro is more flexible than the corresponding loop of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while the adjacent loops are mildly flexible (Fig. 1C) . It is worth adding, that this loop is carrying the unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residue S46. These results indicate a serious obstacle for Structure-Based Drug Design which focuses mostly on the similarities between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros and might ignore the fact that the actual available binding space differs significantly. Therefore, repurposing SARS drugs against COVID-19 may not be successful due to major shape and size differences, and despite docking methods, the enhanced sampling should be considered.We used 6 different cosolvents as molecular probes to investigate the most probable interaction sites in the Mpros' interior and run in total 600 ns of mixed-solvent molecular dynamics (MixMD) simulations. The combination of local solvent distribution and ligand tracking approach provided identification of those regions of the Mpros structures that attract molecular probes (so-called global hot-spots describing the intramolecular voids of the protein, and the local hot-spots describing the binding cavity). The largest number and the densest hot-spots are located within the binding cavity and the region essential for Mpros dimerisation 12 , between the II and III domains. In both Mpros the binding cavity is particularly occupied by urea and benzene molecules, which is especially interesting, due to the fact that these solvents exhibit different chemical properties. The general distribution of the global hot-spots from particular cosolvents is quite similar and verifies specific interactions with the particular regions of the analysed proteins. A notable number of hot-spots are located around the amino acids that vary between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros (Fig. 1D) . The benzene hot-spots for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure are localised also deep inside the active site cavity, while SARS-CoV Mpro features mostly benzene hot-spots at the cavity entrance (Fig. 1E ). This is interesting since, in the absence of cosolvent molecules, the water accessible volume for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was 50% smaller than in the case of SARS-CoV Mpro, underlining huge plasticity of the binding cavity and suggesting large conformational changes induced by interaction with a potential ligand. It is also interesting, that both global and local hot-spots of the SARS-CoV Mpro structure are located in the proximity of the C44-P52 loop, which potentially regulates the access to the active site.All above-mentioned differences underline difficulties in antiviral drug discovery arising from evolution-driven virus variability. The future changes in Mpros structures can dash the effort applied for drug discovery. Indeed, the analysis of evolutionary-correlated residues shows that they are dispersed throughout the structure (Fig. 1E) . Among them, we identified also those that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros, located on the C44-P52 loop (regulating access to the binding site) and the F185-T201 linker loop (contributing to Mpro dimerization 13 ). The correlated mutation analysis indicate that Q189 from the linker loop correlates with residues from the C44-P52 loop, whereas R188, A191, and A194 correlate with selected residues from all domains, but not with the C44-P52 loop. To further evaluate the effect of the 12 amino acid replacements on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure stability, we calculated the differences in Gibbs free energies of protein folding corresponding to the wild-type. The replacements were found to stabilise the protein's folding (e.g., H134F: -0.85 kcal/mol) or have almost neutral character (e.g., R88K, S94A, T285A, I286L). Such a result was expected, since for successful virus transformation both stability and the performance of the Mpro have to be sustained. To examine the potential risk of further Mpro structure evolution we simulated the single nucleotide substitutions process to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease gene. If a substitution of a single nucleotide caused translation to a different amino acid than the corresponding residue in the wild-type structure, an appropriate mutation was proposed and the differences in Gibbs free energies of protein folding were calculated. A close look at residues located within 7Å from the N3 inhibitor suggests that mutations of residues that contribute to ligand binding or access to the active site are energetically favourable, likely to occur (Fig. 1F) . Some of the residues that are prone to mutate would provide the inactive enzyme (e.g., the residues forming the catalytic dyad), but others (e.g., amino acids from the C44-P52 loop, T45, S46, E47, L50) could significantly modify the inhibitors binding mode of Mpro.In general, all the above-mentioned findings indicate potential difficulties in the identification of specific inhibitors toward Mpro proteins. The huge plasticity of the binding cavity provides substantial difficulties with drug repositioning and new inhibitors designing. The high potential mutability of the C44-P52 loop indicates that the future evolution of the Mpro can wipe out all our efforts when this protein is considered as a molecular target for COVID-19 treatment due to a probable development of drug resistance. However, our results indicate also residues that are energetically unfavourable to mutate (P39, R40, P52, G143, G146, L167) and they could provide an anchor for successful drug design that can outlast coronavirus Mpros variability in future. Alternatively, we would suggest targeting the region between II and III domains which contributes to the dimer formation.A total of 2 μs of cMD simulations (AMBER18 14 ) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros starting from the apo structures and with a N3 inhibitor were performed (PDB IDs: 6lu7, 6y2e, 1q2w and 2amq); the inhibitor was removed from the structures before starting the simulation. The systems preparation protocol and simulation conditions were taken from the previous work 15 (pH set to 7.4). AQUA-DUCT software was employed to inspect the MAV of the binding cavities during the simulation time and the overall distribution of solvent in the protein's interior. The region of interest was defined as a 5Å sphere around the centre of geometry of the active site residues (H41, C145, H164, D187), and molecules of interest were traced within the interior of a convex hull of the protein's atoms. Various cosolvents: acetonitrile, benzene, dimethylsulfoxide, methanol, phenol, and urea were used as molecular probes to investigate the most probable interaction sites of both apo Mpro structures. A total of 600 ns of MixMD simulations (protocol as for the cMD, the heating stage extended to 40 ps) were performed and ligand tracking approach was used to identify regions in which cosolvent molecules are being trapped and or/caged, located within the protein itself (global hot-spots) and inside the binding cavity (local hot-spots).To verify the potential threat of the further mutability, the correlated mutation analysis based on the multiple sequence alignment of 2643 sequences of viral Mpros was conducted. The differences in Gibbs free energies of protein folding of introduced 12 amino acids replacements into the SARS-CoV Mpro structure corresponding to the wild-type were calculated (FoldX)."

CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173 doi: medRxiv preprintThis paper is the first reported clinical study in a non-Hubei study in China.There are several differences, compared with the clinical analysis results reported by Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (refer to as Tongji Hospital Affiliated hereafter). Only 2 of the 36 cases included in this study were assessed as critical on admission, while the rest of the cases were mainly of normal type and not severe. [2] [3] On admission, 50% of the patients had fever and cough as their first symptoms, mainly moderate and low fever, with few gastrointestinal symptoms. In this study, the lymphocyte absolute value reduction is only in 5 cases (13.9%), hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%), significantly lower than the 69% and 93% reported by Tongji Hospital Affiliated s, or less than 35% and 86% of the Jinyintan Hospital reports respectively. That may be involved with the fact that this study is mainly based on the common type and mild type.The changes of lymphocyte absolute value and hypersensitive c-reactive protein in patients with the common and mild cases of the new coronavirus pneumonia are not as evident as those in the severe and critical cases, which can be easily ignored during clinical observation. In this study, we found a decrease in prealbumin in 15 cases (41.67%), and no previous studies have reported prealbumin changes. Prealbumin is usually used in clinical evaluation of the nutritional status of the body, and the half-life of serum prealbumin is short, so its changes may occur before albumin. In this study, there were only 5 patients with decreased albumin, all of which were with a slight decrease, but 14 patients (41.67%)showed decreased prealbumin. The pulmonary CT findings of the patients were basically consistent with previous reports. Twenty-two (61.11%) of the patients showed abnormal findings, with ground glass density shadows..

As a commonly used indicator to evaluate nutritional status in clinical practice, prealbumin is often utilized to evaluate tumor and postoperative recovery [4] . Domestic scholar CAI Chuanqi et al. [5] found that hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for the severity of disease in elderly pneumonia patients. This study found that the albumin in the disease group was basically normal, while the prealbumin was significantly lower than that in the normal control group. We analyzed the relationship between prealbumin and CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells respectively. The regression model showed that there is a linear and positive correlation between the level of prealbumin in the serum of patients and CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, with the strongest correlation among CD8 + T cells. Proalbumin is an acute reactive protein synthesized by liver cells with a half-life of 19 days [6] . In the early stage of the disease, proalbumin changes, which may be caused by the consumption of proalbumin by the body after infection with the virus, leading to the reduction of proalbumin in peripheral blood. Recent studies have found that inflammation is an effective inhibitor of protein synthesis, and it may also inhibit the synthesis of visceral prealbumin during the occurrence and development of the disease, leading to a low level of prealbumin [7] . Due to fever and infection, the body is in a state of high decomposition and high energy demand. If at the same time with lack of energy and loss of appetite, the patient cannot ensure sufficient food intake through the mouth to meet the needs of the body. Meanwhile if combined with basic diseases of other viscera, moderate or severe malnutrition can easily appear in pneumonia patients. Clinical studies have found that malnutrition rates in patients with severe pneumonia are as high as 60%, with immune dysfunction. Enteral nutrition or other forms of nutritional support are usually provided only to patients with severe pneumonia. Good nutritional status not .

Prealbumin can be used as an early warning indicator of immune function in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia. Through the analysis of the relationship between prealbumin and T cell subsets, the decreased value of prealbumin indicates that the patient's cellular immune function is impaired, which plays a certain role in clinical condition monitoring.According to the current outbreak reports, most of the patients are mild and normal type. In this study, we concluded that lymphocyte changes are not significant in the early stage of the disease in both normal and mild patients, and that changes in t-cell subsets and prealbumin might be beneficial for evaluating the disease."
6om1y33o,Kallikrein 13: a new player in coronaviral infections,"HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of both inhibitors (Fig. 2B) . All inhibitors were used 151 at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 2C) . 152 The experiments conducted so far suggested that KLK13 is required for virus infection. 153 However, one may question the specificity of the KLK13 protease inhibitors. To ensure that 154 KLK13 is indeed the priming enzyme during HCoV-HKU1 infection, we developed HAE 155 cultures by transforming cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting KLK13 156 mRNA. We then confirmed that the expression of the protease was silenced (HAE_shKLK13). (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, HAE_shKLK13 cells continued to differentiate and formed 162 pseudostratified cultures (Fig. 3B) . Next, we infected HAE_ctrl, HAE_GFP, HAE_vector, and 163 HAE_shKLK13 with HCoV-HKU1 (10 6 RNA copies per ml) and incubated them for 2 h at 164 32°C with the viral stock solution. Cultures were maintained at 32°C for 5 days at an air-liquid 165 interface. Apical washes were collected, and virus yield was determined by RT-qPCR. We 166 found that, in contrast to that in control cultures, replication of virus in HAE_shKLK13 was 167 abolished (Fig. 3C) . Overall, these data suggest that silencing the KLK13 gene in HAE inhibits 168 virus infection, indicating that KLK13 is necessary for HCoV-HKU1 infection. 171 We determined that KLK13 is essential for efficient HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint proteases my render RD cells permissive, we generated RD cells expressing human KLK13 or 176 TMPRSS2 proteases. RD cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring the KLK13 177 gene (RD_KLK13), control vector (RD_ctrl), or TMPRSS2 (RD_TMPRSS2). Due to the lack 178 of KLK13 specific antibodies, we verified its presence based on RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) . The 179 presence of TMPRSS2 in RD_TMPRSS2 cells was confirmed using Western blot. The 180 TMPRSS2 band in RD cells was observed at 25 kDa, which corresponds to one of the naturally 181 occurring splicing variants (Fig. 4B) . Subsequently, we transduced RD_ctrl, RD_KLK13 and pseudoviruses, compared to ΔEnv, which was completely abolished in the presence of KLK13 193 inhibitor (Fig 4D) . Overall, these data demonstrated that KLK13 activity drives HCoV-HKU1 194 entry into cells. 195 196 KLK13 enables the replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells 197 Obtained results showed that KLK13 expression on RD cells was sufficient for HCoV-198 HKU1 pseudovirus entry.

Next, cellular RNA was isolated 202 and the presence of HCoV-HKU1 N subgenomic mRNA (N sg mRNA), which is considered 203 to be a hallmark of coronaviral infection, was assessed (14). sg mRNA appeared in RD_KLK13 204 cells, while no signal was detected in cultures supplemented with the KLK13 inhibitor nor in 205 RD_ctrl cells (Fig. 5A) . 206 To further confirm the role of KLK13 during HCoV-HKU1 infection RD HCoV-HKU1 infection was analyzed by means of N sg mRNA detection. Again, we found that 212 N sg mRNA was produced only in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B) . Further, we passaged in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B) . However, we observed no cytopathic effects (CPEs), and 218 replication levels were very low (no significant increase over control levels on RT-qPCR; data 219 not shown). To further test the effect of KLK13 on replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells, the 220 virus stock was incubated with purified KLK13 (200 nM) and incubated in the presence or 221 absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 µM) or DMSO. After 2 h at 32°C pre-treated virus stock was 222 diluted in media as described above and overlaid on RD cells. After 7 days at 32°C we evaluated 223 the presence of the HCoV-HKU1 N sg mRNA.

Subsequently, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting 238 with antibodies specific for His-tagged proteins. The analysis showed that, in the presence of 239 500 nM KLK13, the CleavEx protein harboring the S1/S2 cleavage site was degraded; however, 240 the CleavEx protein harboring the S2/S2' site remained intact. Because KLKs are produced as 241 pro-forms that undergo self-activation, an additional band of His-tagged purified pro-KLK13 242 (HisTag-pro-KLK13) was observed after treatment with 500 nM KLK13 (Fig. 6A) . The product 243 of the S1/S2 cleavage was further sequenced by N-terminal Edman degradation showing the 244 following sequence: R↓SISA, which corresponds to the S1/S2 site. This result shows clearly 245 that the S1/S2 region of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein is prone to KLK13-mediated cleavage. 246 Furthermore, we aimed to confirm the cleavage using a full-length Spike protein of HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1-S). For this, we expressed the HKU1-S in 293T cells, purified the protein 248 using 6 × His tag, and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with increasing concentrations of purified 249 KLK13. Subsequently, HKU-S or mock proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by 250 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research, 281 although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al. 282 showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several 283 proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is 284 not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and 285 TMPRSS2 (81). We tried to use specific KLK inhibitors developed in our laboratory (61).Considering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three 287 compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that 288 only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the 289 great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors, 290 despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in 291 HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of 292 KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound(82, 83). 293 This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of 294 different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semi-295 quantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation 296 after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could 297 be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only 298 been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones (84). It is also 299 important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction 300 of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster (85, 86). While one may 301 assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation 302 is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take 303 part also in tissue regeneration (87-89). Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the 304 author/funder. All rights reserved.

We 309 tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell 310 line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD 311 cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus (26). Here, using 312 pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells 313 is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed 314 that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process(51). Furthermore, 315 we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and 316 that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however, 317 not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD 318 cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the 319 amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are 320 considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to 321 non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or 322 low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient 323 replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our resultsshow that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger 325 virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.Most coronaviral S proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint HCoV-HKU1 S protein has two regions that are prone to proteolytic activation: the S1/S2 furin 330 cleavage site and a secondary cleavage site termed S2', which is adjacent to a potential fusion 331 peptide (38). While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein 332 biosynthesis, the S2/S2' site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the 338 S2/S2' region remained intact. As CleavEx technique is a convenient surrogate system allowing 339 for precise mapping of the cleavage site, it has some limitations. To ensure the reliability of 340 results, purified full-length HCoV-HKU1 S protein was subjected to the proteolytic cleavage.Also here we observed efficient cleavage of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein by KLK13.While the results presented here show that KLK13 is able to process the HCoV-HKU1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint to cross the species barrier and cause severe diseases in humans, further research on the role of 355 different proteases in coronaviral infections is necessary. 356 author/funder.

qmg58cgr,AI-aided design of novel targeted covalent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2,"The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of coronavirus example, the recently solved structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (PDB ID: 6LU7)indicates that the developed inhibitor N3, 6 which is a covalent inhibitor derived from non-covalent inhibitors against SARS can also bind SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with a similar binding conformation ( Figure S4 ).All the above available information paved a way to design new targeted covalent inhibitors (TCI) 7 against SARS-CoV-2. A successful TCI against 3CL pro must first be able to fit in the binding site of 3CL pro with an appropriate pose that keeps its reactive groups close enough to the Cys145, which then undergoes a chemical step (nucleophilic attack by Cys145) leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond as presented in the scheme below:TCIs usually have a longer target residence time than the relative non-covalent inhibitors in theory given the following: 1) For the inhibition, k1 must be larger than k2, and thus the non-covalent binding is determined by the equilibrium constant k1/k2; 2)TCIs have the chemical reaction step with the target, where usually k3 >> k4; and 3) for TCIs, the binding process is controlled by k1 k3/(k2 k4), which is bigger than k1/k2 in non-covalent inhibitors. In some extreme cases k4 = 0, and hence, these irreversible inhibitors covalently bind the target until the target disappears. 7, 8 Considering the inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro may be also bio-active to SARS-CoV-2, we have created a molecular library including all the reported SARS-3CL pro inhibitors (284 molecules) 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and we will also add new validated molecular structures into this library with our research progresses. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2.Thus, with the hope to discover novel candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, we combine artificial intelligence (AI) with the structure-based drug design (SBDD) to accelerate generating potential lead compounds and design TCIs. AI, especially deep learning, has been applied in predicting molecular properties 30, 31, 32, 33 and designing novel molecules 34 . Unlike earlier deep-learning molecular design by adding single atom one at a time 34, 35 , our approach explores new molecules by adding a meaningful molecular fragment one by one, which is not only computationally more efficient but also chemically more reasonable. To make our AI model work well, the first step is to prepare the molecular fragment library as shown in Figure 1 . We used our collected SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors (284 molecules) as the initial molecule database targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Then, we split this set of molecules into fragments with a molecule weight no more than 200 daltons. Both of the collected inhibitors and the fragments are supplied in https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.Then we applied an advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds. Noted, if researchers have enough experience and internal lead compounds or biased fragments, they can inject all such information into ADQN-FBDD by manually adding the lead compounds and biased fragments to the corresponding files. By using the same fragments directly from existing bioactivate molecules, our ADQN-FBDD agent can easily access the potential chemical space focused on 3CL pro of SARS-CoV-2.author/funder.

In total, 47 of these compounds were selected with high scores from our AImodel's reward function. Then these molecules were further evaluated by docking and covalent docking studies. The lead compound #46 with a high covalent docking score attracts our attention, which also has a low difference between non-covalent and covalent docking pose among the 47 lead compounds. After carefully checking the lead #46's interaction mode with 3CL pro , we believe there is still much space to optimize lead it. Then we designed a series of derivatives from compound #46 based on our chemical biology knowledge and the structure-based optimization policy. All the generated molecular structures are published in our code library https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. We encourage researchers who are interested in finding a potential treatment for this viral infection to synthesize and evaluate some of these molecules for treating COVID-19.

These 47 virtual leads display suitable 3Dcomplexity with common characteristics of peptidomimetics and protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. They are mainly ranked by covalent-docking scores, considering covalent-docking also contains the scores of non-covalent docking. 36 And we also paid attention on the RMSD difference between the covalent binding and noncovalent binding poses based on all heavy atoms. Finally, we selected the lead molecule #46 as displayed in Figure 3 with both a good covalent docking score and a small RMSD value (Table S1 ). We further optimized it and get a series of derivatives based on the SBDD approach.Molecule #46 was ranked number 1 based on the covalent docking score and its interaction model with the binding site was carefully checked as shown in Figure 3 .Although compound #46 has the best covalent docking score, it has the alerting group aldehyde.

The triazole ring forms an H-bond with His163; the fragment of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde forms a covalent bond with Cys145, i.e., the key residue in the catalytic center of the protease, resulting in covalent inhibition; aldehyde carbonyl forms an H-bond with His41; and besides, the hydroxyl of chromone at position 7 forms an H-bond with Thr190.The non-bonding interaction between compound 46-14-1 and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is mainly hydrogen bond. The carbonyl group of covalent scaffold α-ketoamide forms Hbonds with Leu141 and Gly143 as a hydrogen acceptor or a hydrogen donor. The hydrogen on the nitrogen atom of the triazole ring forms an H-bond with Glu166, while Glu166 also forms an H-bond with the carbonyl group on the main chain. The oxygen in the β-lactam ring forms an H-bond with His41. In order to enhance the polarity of the compounds, sulfonic groups were introduced to replace the ketone carbonyl groups on the main chain and sulfonamides 46-14-2 were obtained. The covalent docking model of compound 46-14-2 with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is shown in Figure 4 C and D.In order to make the compound 46-14-2 fit the active pocket with a higher affinity, we added a carbon atom to the sulfonic acid group of the original molecule, extending the carbon chain to increase the flexibility of the molecule, and obtained another optimized compound 46-14-3. The mode of covalent docking with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is shown in Figure 5 . Due to the introduction of carbon atoms and the enhancement of molecular flexibility, the β-lactam ring can be inserted deeper into the S2 pocket and the other fragments of the compound can better adapt to the S1, S1' and S3 subsites. The αcarbonyl carbon on the α-ketoamide of compound 46-14-3 forms a covalent bond with the key residue Cys145 on the protease, but the main non-bond interaction is still hydrogen bond (indicated by a yellow dash). The triazole ring mainly forms H-bonds with Phe140 and Glu166 residues in the S1 pocket; α-ketoamide covalent binding fragment mainly forms H-bonds with key amino acid residues Cys145, Gly143 and Ser144 in the S1' subsite, which forms an oxyanion hole in the red circle in Figure 9 ; the β-lactam side chain mainly forms H-bonds with residues Tyr54 and AsS187 in the author/funder.

Our ADQN-FBDD and related pipeline can be used not only for designing anti-COVID-19 drugs but also other structure-based drug discoveries, especially for emerging infetious diseases that require treatments timely.Intuitively, the problem of chemical structure graph generation is formulated as learning a reinforced agent, which performs discrete actions of chemical reaction-based fragment addition or removal in a chemistry-aware Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Here, we define the state transition to be deterministic. For example, as Figure 2C indicates S0 to S1, by adding a 1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl fragment on S0, the next state S1 will be the new structure of added 1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl with a probability of 1.R is the reward function that specifies the reward after reaching state ', (0,1] is the discount factor and typically γ = 0.9 in our study. In our framework, the state always has a valid and complete chemical structure at each step as Figure 2C indicates. A reward is given not just at the terminal states, but at each step. Both intermediate rewards and final rewards are used to guide the behavior of the reinforcement learning (RL) agent. So, there is no delayed or sparse reward issue as many other reinforced frameworks suffered. 40, 41 Furthermore, to ensure that the last state is rewarded the most, we use γ T-t to discount the value of the rewards at state ' . In addition, our reward function can directly integrate the experience of medicinal chemists. For example, given a core of interest, medicinal chemists may add biased fragments of their interests and their input can be used to design a reward function that gives high reward signal values to biased fragments so that ADQN-FBDD may have a better chance to generate the desired structures.In our RL framework, the chemical environment receives action at from the agent and emits scalar reward rt and state s ' 3 to the agent as Figure 2A shows. Note that the definition of the environment state is different from the general approach that the environment state is only the environment's private representation invisible to the agent.We define the state of the chemical environment s ' 3 as the intermediate generated molecule structure at time step t, which is fully observable by the RL agent.

However, the widely used fragment libraries only consider the diversity of fragments, such as the ZINC fragment database.

This way may be useful in testing the performance of RL methods but not suitable in a real-world drug design because no one knows the complete structural information of the novel molecule. A more practical approach is to learn the structure features of existing drugs or inhibitors to local, focused chemical space for a specific protein target. Instead of simply putting attention on the diversity of molecule structure, we explore the possibility of generating novel molecules based on the existing knowledge.

QED values can range from 0 (all properties are unfavourable) to 1 (all properties are favourable), which are calculated by eight molecular properties. 53 The score function {?€ of containing specific fragments (csf) is:author/funder.

The pictures of the binding site are generated using PyMol ((http://www.pymol.org/).The binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro ( Figure 9 ) is commonly divided into the catalytic activity center (His41 and Cys145, specified as S1') and several subsites, defined as S1 (His163, Glu166, Phe140, Leu141 and Asn142), S1' (His41, Cys145, Gly143 and Ser144), S2 (Tyr54, Asp187, His41, Arg188, His164 and Met49), and S3(Thr190, Gln192, Glu166, Met165, Leu167 and Gln189).

myh73pe6,"Exploring diseases/traits and blood proteins causally related to expression of ACE2, the putative receptor of 2019-nCov: A Mendelian Randomization analysis","higher than the binding affinity to the previous SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein 12 . This provides strong evidence that ACE2 is a target of the novel coronavirus.A number of studies have looked into the relationship between ACE2 expression level and coronavirus infection. For example, Li et al. overexpressed ACE2 protein in 293T and Vero E6 cell lines. Over-expression of ACE2 lead to more efficient viral replication, but it was blocked by anti-ACE2 antibody in a dose-dependent manner 9 . A further study also confirmed that susceptibility to SAR-CoV correlates with ACE2 expression on cell lines 13 . In a subsequent work, Jia et al. showed that undifferentiated airway epithelial cells that express little ACE2 were poorly infected by SARS-CoV, while well-differential cells expressing higher ACE2 were readily infected 14 . Taking the evidence together, expression level of the ACE2 protein is associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.Since ACE2 has been supported by multiple studies as a receptor for 2019-nCov, it is reasonable to speculate that higher ACE2 expression in relevant tissues (e.g. the lung) may lead to increased susceptibility to infection. As discussed above, studies have indeed supported this hypothesis for SARS-CoV. While further studies are required, revealing diseases/traits that are causally associated with altered ACE2 expression may shed light on why certain subjects are more susceptible to the infection and the underlying mechanisms (whether the increased susceptibility is mediated via ACE2).In a related work, recently Cai 15 performed an analysis with TCGA datasets and showed that smoking is associated with elevated expression of ACE2 in the lung, which may be associated with greater susceptibility to infection or more severe illness. However, there are several limitations as detailed by the author. For example, the samples studied are derived from patients with lung cancer, which may not be fully reflective of the expression in normal lung tissues. Another potential limitation is that it is difficult to control for all confounders, as smoking may be related to other unhealthy life habits 16 and multiple comorbid diseases 17, 18 .Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore diseases or traits that may be causally linked to increased ACE2 expression in the lung. We will employ MR for causal inference. MR makes use of genetic variants as ""instruments"" to represent the exposure of interest, and infers causal relationship between the exposure and the outcome 19 . MR is much less susceptible to confounding bias and reverse causality when compared to observational studies.The concept of MR is akin to randomized controlled trials (RCT). For example, consider a study on the causal effect of lipid on the risk of a certain disease. Subjects who have inherited lipid-lowering alleles at a locus (or a set of such alleles at multiple loci) will have lower lipid levels on average, which is analogous to receiving lipid-lowering drugs in an RCT 20 . The random allocation of alleles at conception is similar to random assignment of treatment in an RCT. As a result, the chance of spurious associations due to known or unknown confounders is reduced due to the 'random assignment' of treatment or risk factor. Another important point to .

Since COVID-19 is a new disease and prior knowledge is lacking, we employed a phenome-wide approach in which a large variety of traits are studied for causal associations with ACE2 expression. This analysis may help to prioritize resources for better prevention of the infection in those susceptible subjects.In addition to diseases, we also studied serum/plasma proteins as exposure, as they may point to potential molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may serve as potential predictive or prognostic biomarkers. It has also been suggested that such proteome-wide studies may help to reveal drug repositioning candidates 21 , through the search for drugs that target the top-ranked proteins. For example, if a protein is found to casually increase the risk of a disease by MR, by the definition of causality, blocking the protein will lead to reduced disease risks. In our study, by finding plasma/serum proteins causally linked to ACE2 expression, we may find drugs that will alter ACE2 expression, which in turn may be useful for treatment.To perform the phenome-study, we made use of the latest IEU GWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/), which contains up to 111,908,636,549 genetic associations from 31,773 GWAS summary datasets (as at 26 th Feb 2020). The database was retrieved via the R package ""TwoSampleMR"" (ver 0.5.1). MR analysis was conducted with the same package. Due to the extremely huge number of traits in the database, we performed some pre-selection to the list of traits/diseases before full analysis. Briefly, we selected the following categories of traits: (1) Traits listed as priority 1 (high priority) and labelled as ""Disease"" or ""Risk factor"" (81 and 71 items respectively); (2) traits labelled as ""protein"" as described above (3371 items); (3) (selected) traits from the UK Biobank, as it is one of the largest source of GWAS data worldwide (with sample size ~ 500,000). We consider that a proportion of traits have presumably low prior probability of association with respiratory infections, and others are less directly clinically relevant. To reduce computational burden and for ease of interpretation, a proportion of UK Biobank (UKBB) traits were filtered. More specifically, we excluded GWAS data of diseases or traits related to the following: eye or hearing problems, orthopedic and trauma-related conditions (except autoimmune diseases), skin problems (except systemic or autoimmune diseases), perinatal and obstetric problems, operation history, medication history (as confounding by indication is common and may affect the validity of results 22 ), diet/exercise habit (as accuracy of information .

While ideally one should study the protein expression in the lung, such data is scarce and corresponding genotype data (required for MR) is not available. Here we focus on the gene expression of ACE2 in the lung (N = 515). ACE2 protein levels appear to be relatively well-correlated with mRNA levels across tissues, based on the Human Proteome Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130234-ACE2/tissue). We retrieved GWAS summary data from the GTEx database, one of the largest databases to date with both genotype and expression data for a large variety of tissues. For details of GTEx please refer to 24 .Here we performed two-sample MR in which the instrument-exposure and instrument-outcome associations were estimated in different samples. We conducted MR primarily with the 'inverse-variance weighted'(MR-IVW) 25 and Egger regression (MR-Egger) 26 approaches, which are among the most widely used MR methods. One of the concerns of MR is horizontal pleiotropy, in which the genetic instruments have effects on the outcome other than through effects on the exposure. Of note, MR-Egger gives valid estimates of causal effects in the presence of imbalanced or directional horizontal pleiotropy. In addition, significance of the MR-Egger intercept can be used to judge whether significant imbalanced pleiotropy is present. MR was performed on (approximately) independent SNPs with r 2 threshold of 0.001, following default settings in TwoSampleMR. We only included SNPs passing genome-wide significance (p<5e-8) as instruments. For exposure with only one instrument, the Wald ratio method was used. For analysis with less than 3 genetic instruments, we employed MR-IVW since MR-Egger cannot be reliably performed. As will be detailed in the results section, for selected trait(s) with stronger evidence of association, we also performed further analysis by GSMR and MR-RAPS. GSMR (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gsmr/) can take into account of (imbalanced) horizontal pleiotropy but is based on a different principle from MR-Egger. It excludes 'outlier'or heterogeneous genetic instruments that may contribute to pleiotropy, by the 'HEIDI-outlier' method 27 ..

MR-RAPS is another MR analysis methodology which can take into account multiple weak instruments by a robust procedure. Details of MR-RAPS were described in Zhao et al. 28 .We also performed analysis with plasma/serum proteins as exposure. Besides MR analysis on individual proteins, we also performed pathway analysis by ClueGO 29 . Hypergeometric tests were conducted on the top-ranked proteins (with p<0.05). In addition, we searched for drugs with targets overlapping with the top-ranked proteins. Drug targets were defined based on the DrugBank database. Our aim is uncover drug candidates leading to alteration of ACE2 expression, which may be therapeutically relevant.MR results are presented in Tables 1 and 2 (full results shown in Tables S2 and S3 ). Traits were shown if any of the three methods (MR-IVW, MR-Egger, Wald ratio) showed nominally significant (p<0.05) results. For traits that do not show evidence for directional pleiotropy (p-value of Egger Intercept>0.05), we shall primarily report the results from MR-IVW, as generally the SE of causal estimates is larger with MR-Egger 30 (hence power is weaker). Results from MR-Egger will be presented if there is significant directional pleiotropy.Remarkably, a number of top-ranked results were related to diabetes. We observed totally five diabetes-related traits that showed nominally significant MR results, and they were all positively associated with ACE2 expression. Three are related to diagnosis of diabetes (including both type I and II) in the UKBB.Another one (id: ieu-a-23) was based on a trans-ethnic meta-analysis in 2014 31 , which had no overlap with the UKBB sample. The finding of a nominally significant result in this dataset can therefore be considered as an independent replication of the UKBB result.We also observed that starting insulin within one year of diagnosis, which was only assessed within diabetic subjects, was casually associated with increased ACE2 expression. Early use of insulin may indicate type I diabetes as the underlying diagnosis or more severe or late-stage disease for type II diabetic subjects 32 .In view of the consistent causal associations with diabetes or related traits, we further searched for GWAS summary statistics that have not been included in the IEU GWAS database. We found another publicly available dataset from the DIAGRAM Consortium, based on a recent meta-analysis of type II diabetes by Mahajan et al. 33 .For a more in-depth analysis, we also employed GSMR and MR-RAPS in addition to IVW and Egger. The full results are presented in Table 2 . Reassuringly, with the exception of MR-Egger (which is relatively less . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237 doi: medRxiv preprint powerful 30 ), all other methods showed (nominally) significant results. GSMR reported the lowest p-value of 2.49E-04 (beta = 0.1835, 95% CI: 0.0853 to 0.2817). While this study 33 has partial overlap with the trans-ethnic analysis in 2014 31 , the consistent associations provide further support to a causal link between diabetes and expression of ACE2.Regarding the effect size of casual associations, since the exposures were binary, the regression coefficients (beta) from MR may be roughly interpreted as average change in the outcome (increase in normalized expression level) per 2.72-fold increase in the prevalence of the exposure 34 . For type II diabetes, or self-reported diabetes from UKBB which presumably comprised mainly type II diabetes, the causal estimates ranged from ~0.1621 to 0.1835. These estimates were reasonably close despite different datasets being used.The causal estimate from type I diabetes was slightly lower and estimated to be ~0.1006.As shown in Table 1 , a number of other disease/traits also showed (nominally) significant results. Several neoplasms, such as breast and lung cancer, may be associated with increased ACE2 expression. We also observed that several autoimmune disorders, especially inflammatory bowel diseases may be casually associated with ACE2 expression. Interestingly, asthma and tobacco use also showed nominal significant associations with higher ACE2 expression. As for other traits, high alanine aminotransferase (ALT), commonly associated with liver diseases, may be related to elevated ACE2 expression. Other commonly measured blood measures that may lead to altered ACE2 expression also included red cell distribution width (often associated with iron-deficiency, folate or B12 deficiency anemia), basophil percentage (inverse relationship), calcium level, urate level, HDL-cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (inverse relationship).Full results are shown in Table S2 and the enriched pathways are shown in Table 3 and Table S4 . Since a large number of proteins are involved, we only highlight a few top pathways here. Some of top pathways include cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction, VEGFA-VEGF2 signaling pathway, JAS-STAT signaling pathway etc. Table 4 and S5 shows the list of drugs whose targets overlap with the top-ranked proteins. Note that the tables do not explicitly discern the direction of effects of the drugs. A few drugs target more than one protein. If they are ranked by the number of proteins targeted, the top drugs are fostamatinib, copper, zinc and zonisamide, which target >=3 proteins.In this study we have employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) to uncover diseases/traits that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression levels in the lung, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection.We believe such analysis is of value as observational studies are more prone to confounding bias. Also, in .

Such studies may also be limited by the lack of relevant clinical data for some patients.From our analysis, the most consistent finding was the casual link between diabetes (and related traits) with ACE2 expression, which was supported by multiple datasets and different analytic approaches. Other results were more tentative, but may be worthy of further studies. For example, several neoplasms (e.g. breast and lung cancers) and autoimmune diseases, elevated ALT, asthma and smoking all showed nominally significant and positive associations with ACE2 expression. If the findings are replicated and confirmed in further studies, there may be clinical implications.For example, identification of those at greater risk may help to guide the prioritization of resources to reduce infection risks in susceptible groups. Also, it is likely that vaccines may be developed in the near future; in the lack of resources, susceptible groups may be prioritized to receive vaccination to maximize cost-effectiveness.In a similar vein, if resources are limited, the more susceptible subjects may receive higher priority for diagnostic testing for the infection. As far as treatment is concerned, if certain conditions such as diabetes indeed increases susceptibility via ACE2, then drugs targeting at this gene/protein may be particularly useful for this patient subgroup. For example, human recombinant ACE2 has been proposed as a treatment and is under clinical trial for COVID-19 35 . It will be interesting to see if the drug may be more beneficial for DM patients. More generally speaking, if DM is causally linked to elevated ACE2 and potentially increased susceptibility to infection, then anti-diabetic drugs or improved glycemic control may reverse the process.Interestingly, a few studies have shown that metformin may reduce mortality from lower respiratory disease in diabetic patients{Ho, 2019 #59;Mendy, 2019 #60}. It will be intriguing to know if metformin (or other anti-diabetic medications) may be clinically beneficial in preventing or reducing the severity of disease in diabetic or non-diabetic subjects.Here we further discuss on a few disease/traits also supported by previous studies. First, as discussed in the introduction, a recent study 15 also suggested smoking was associated with higher ACE2 expression. Our analysis adds further support to the hypothesis, but we further showed that the relationship may be casual. As shown in Table S1 , a number of COVID-19 cases (~5.4%) were also comorbid with diabetes mellitus (DM).Similarly, DM was also common in patients infected with MERS-CoV 36,37 . Kulcsar et al. built a mouse model susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and induced type 2 DM using a high-fat diet. They found that, if affected by the virus, these diabetic mice suffered from a prolonged phase of disease and delayed recovery, which might be due to a dysregulated immune response 38 . With regards to comorbidity with cancers, Liang et al. recently carried out a nationwide analysis of 1,590 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and suggested that cancer patients might have a higher infection risk than those without 39 . The study also reported higher risk of severe complications in such patients..

A major limitation is that the sample size for GTEx is relatively modest, which limits the power of MR analysis.However, to our knowledge, GTEx is probably the largest database with both genotype and expression data for lung tissues.Another point we wish to emphasize is that we consider this work as largely an exploratory rather than confirmatory study. Our main purpose is to prioritize diseases, traits or proteins with potential causal links with ACE2 expression, and hence possibly increased susceptibility to 2019-nCov infection. Owing to relatively modest sample size of the outcome dataset of GTEx (N = 515), we expect the power to be modest. Also in view of the exploratory and hypothesis-generating nature of this study, we have not implemented stringent multiple testing procedures such as Bonferroni correction. On the other hand, we examined the consistency of the observed associations across different datasets, and considered those supported by more than one set of data as relatively more trustworthy or robust, similar to the approach adopted by Pendergrass et al. 40 . However, we emphasize that our findings will require further replications and support by further clinical and experimental studies.On the other hand, we also wish to highlight some results could be false negatives. The main reason for false negatives is the limited sample size of GTEx, and that for some exposure traits, the number of instruments available may be small. For example, in our analysis, we do not find evidence of hypertension or blood pressure, history of coronary heart disease and stroke to be casually linked to ACE2 expression, although patients with severe infections have been reported to be enriched for these comorbidities.As discussed above, increased expression of ACE2 appears to be correlated with susceptibility to SARS-Cov and 201-nCoV infection. Nevertheless, the consequences of altered ACE2 expression may be rather complex. Kuba et al. reported that the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV down-modulated ACE2 expression 10 , which may lead to heightened risks of acute lung injury. Another study 41 suggested ACE2 may protect against acute pulmonary failure by blocking the renin-angiotensin signaling pathway. However, whether the same may apply to 2019-nCov is still unknown. If this is the case, then one may hypothesize that for unaffected individuals or those without (or with minimal) lung involvement yet (as could be the case for some subjects at the early stage of disease), a lower level of ACE2 expression on lung cells may be beneficial in reducing susceptibility to more sustained infection by reducing viral entry. However, for patients with severe lung involvement or at risk of acute lung injury, higher level of ACE2 expression may prevent risk of acute lung failure. Therefore, it may be clinically relevant to identify both types of drugs, i.e. those leading to elevated ACE2 expression as well as those leading to reduced expression. Further studies are warranted to clarify the role of ACE2 and whether drugs targeting ACE2 may be therapeutically useful..

We briefly discuss a few drugs highlighted by our analysis. Fostamatinib targets the largest number (seven) of proteins potentially linked to ACE2 expression. According to DrugBank, it serves as an inhibitor for all these proteins, and all were linked to elevated ACE2 expression in the present MR analysis except one. This drug has been approved for treating Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), and is a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor 42 . There has been trials on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 43 and IgA nephropathy as well 42 .Interestingly, recent studies by the company BenevolentAI 44,45 employed a proprietary knowledge graph approach and found several repositioning candidates 46, 47 . Baricitinib, a JAK 1/2 inhibitor approved for RA, was suggested as a top candidate. The drug was proposed on its action on AAK1 which is a regulator of endocytosis, although how AAK1 was prioritized as target was not described in the study. Fostamatinib, which we prioritized in this study, also inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and AAK1 48 based on curations from DrugBank and was shown to be effective for RA 43 . Of note, two other JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors were recommended by Stebbing et al. 45 , while in our analysis JAK-STAT signaling is among the top 10 pathways enriched for top proteins linked to ACE2 expression. Another candidate highlighted by Richardson et al. 44 , sunitinib, was also top-listed by our MR-based analysis. We have employed a rather different algorithm based on causal inference, when compared to the approach by BenevolentAI. The concordance between different studies provides additional support to the usefulness our MR-based approach, and the drugs with converging evidence by different approaches may be more likely to be true candidates. Zinc was also a top-listed candidate in our study, and it has been reported to reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infections in some studies, e.g. 49 , although further studies are required as the evidence is not firm.Despite some interesting findings, due to limited knowledge of how the drugs act on the targets and their directions of effect, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we consider our results as exploratory findings which require further investigations. We note that a number of drugs may act on more than one target, but the exact pharmacological action on each target is often unclear; the overall direction and magnitude of effect of each drug may not be easily determined and must be verified in further studies. We emphasize that the drugs highlighted in this work are meant to prioritize suitable candidates to speed up discovery for treatments, and are not supposed to be applied to clinical practice or trials yet. However, due to the potential huge cost and extreme urgency of developing new therapies, we believe that any drug repositioning/discovery attempt that may improve the success rate even by a small margin may still be much valuable.CoV-induced changes in ACE2 levels (i.e. the expression changes as a result of CoV infection). This involves complex interaction between the virus, the ACE2 receptor and other downstream pathways, and could not be predicted by the present analysis per se. Our findings from MR mainly reflect diseases/traits/proteins causally linked to ACE2 expression in uninfected subjects, as the outcome dataset (GTEx) is composed of such subjects..

Here we presented a new analytic approach; we made use of existing knowledge of a key receptor of an infectious agent to uncover risk factors as well as repositioning candidates. This analytic framework may also be applied to other diseases, especially when a target can be identified but genomic data for the disease is limited.Notwithstanding the limitations, we have identified several diseases and traits which may be causally related to ACE2 expression the lung, which in turn may mediate susceptibility to 2019-nCoV infection. In addition, our proteome-wide MR analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ACE2 expression. .

j5bepvvw,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion,"In April of 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a priority 56 list of pathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute 57 respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Disease X, a disease with an epidemic or pandemic 58 potential caused by an unknown pathogen 1,2 (Fig.1a) . 59 In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown etiology in 60 Wuhan, China was considered as the first Disease X following the announcement by 61 WHO. Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, as denoted by WHO 3 , 62 was identified as the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease COVID-19 4,5 . 63 2019-nCoV with 79.5% and 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat 64 coronavirus, SL-CoV-RaTG13, respectively 6 , was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the which mediates membrane fusion, has 89.8% sequence identity and 96.9% sequence 83 similarity to those of SARS-CoV, and both of them utilize human 84 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells 6 . 85 Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 86 S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of 87 SARS-CoV 12 , which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of 88 SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 89 can mediate membrane fusion in a manner that exceeds the capacity of SARS-CoV. 90 After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of S protein on the virion to the ACE2 91 receptor on the target cell, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in its S2 92 subunit of S protein interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion 93 core, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and 94 infection 13 . Therefore, the 6-HB fusion core structure of SARS-CoV-2 and 95 SARS-CoV S proteins should also be compared in order to investigate the structural 96 basis for membrane fusion mediated by their S proteins and thus set the stage for the 97 rational design of coronavirus fusion inhibitors. 98 In our previous studies, we designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, 99 targeting the HR1 domains of HCoV S proteins, which proved to be effective in In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity of 108 membrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formed 139 by infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c) . To 140 further explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the S 141 gene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell-cell fusion 142 system, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP 143 (293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressing 144 human ACE2 receptor as the target cells ( Fig. 1d and Fig. S1a ). After effector cells 145 and target cells were cocultured at 37 °C for 2 h, the fused cells showed at least 2-fold 146 larger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in the 147 SARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h, 148 hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiple 149 nuclei (Fig. 1d) . Another 24h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easily Previously, we identified that the 6-HB formed by HR1 and HR2 domains of the 166 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Similarly, our recent study suggested that 168 HR1 and HR2 in subunit S2 of SARS-CoV-2 also interacted to form coiled-coil 169 complex to support membrane fusion and viral infection 15 ( Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 ).However, the specific binding characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 6-HB remained to be 171 explored.To understand the structural basis of the interactions between HR1 and HR2 173 regions of SARS-CoV-2, a fusion protein containing the major parts of HR1 (residues 174 910 to 988) and HR2 (residues 1162 to 1206) with a flexible linker (L6, SGGRGG) in 175 between was constructed for crystallographic study. The crystal structure of 176 HR1-L6-HR2 shows a canonical 6-HB structure with a rod-like shape 115 Å in length 177 and 25 Å in diameter (Fig. 2b) V1164, L1166, I1169, I1172, A1174, V1176, V1177, I1179, I1183, L1186, V1189,   183 L1193, L1197 and I1198 (Fig. 2c) . The hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and 184 HR2 are mainly located in the helical fusion core region, which will be discussed 185 later.The overall 6-HB structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other HCoVs 187 with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.36 Å to SARS-CoV 6-HB and 0.66 Å 188 to MERS-CoV 6-HB for all the Cα atoms (Fig. 2d) . This finding suggested that the 189 overall 6-HB conformation is an important and highly conserved component for these 190 dangerous coronaviruses. When comparing with the 6-HB of other common 191 coronaviruses causing mild respiratory disease, such as 229E and NL63, the 192 SARS-CoV-2 6-HB has a similar overall structure, except for the different length of 193 HR2 helix in the 6-HB. The HR2 domain of 229E or NL63 forms a longer and 194 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The relationship between 195 the structural difference and the pathogenicity of these HCoVs remains to be 196 elucidated.According to sequence alignment, the S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and 198 SARS-CoV are highly conserved, with 92.6% and 100% overall homology in HR1 through a weak salt bridge 3.7 Å in distance. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated to 212 D936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 Å in distance 213 (Fig. 3c) . In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge 214 3.2 Å in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction. However, when T925 215 was mutated to S943, it could bind to E1182 in the HR2 domain with a hydrogen 216 bond 2.6 Å in distance, and K947 could also bind to E1182 through a salt bridge 3.0 217 Å in distance (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested that the multiple replacements in the 218 HR1 domain of emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus could enhance the interactions between 219 HR1 and HR2 domain to further stabilize the 6-HB structure, which may lead to 220 increased infectivity of the virus. 221 author/funder.

Meanwhile, the EK1-scrambled peptide showed no 236 inhibitory activity with the concentration up to 5 μM (Fig. 4c) . These results strongly 237 suggest that lipidation of EK1 is a promising strategy to improve its fusion-inhibitory 238 activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially, cholesterol-modification. 239 On the basis of the structure of EK1C, series of cholesteryl EK1 with multiple 240 linkers were constructed, where the glycine/serine-based linker, i.e., GSG, or 241 PEG-based spacer was employed between EK1 and the cholesterol moiety (Fig. 4d ).Compared with EK1C1, EK1C2 and EK1C showed similar inhibitory activities.Strikingly, EK1C3 peptide with both the 3-amino acid linker ""GSG"" and the 244 PEG4-based spacer, exhibited 4-fold more potency than EK1C1. It is noteworthy that 245 changing ""GSG"" in EK1C3 to a longer 5-amino acid linker ""GSGSG"" significantly 246 increased the inhibitory potency of the hybrid molecule, and EK1C4 had IC 50 value of 247 1.3 nM, which was 43-fold more potent than EK1C1. These findings indicate that the 248 linker length has a significant effect on the overall activity of lipopeptides. 249 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The data suggest that 251 ""GSGSG-PEG4"" linker was optimal to bridge both parts of the conjugates. Similarly, 252 EK1C4 showed the most potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 PsV 253 infection, with IC 50 value of 15.8 nM, providing 149-fold stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 254 activity than that of EK1 (IC 50 =2,375 nM) (Fig. 4f) .The lipopeptide EK1C4 exhibits the most potent inhibitory activity against RsSHC014, the fusion process of which is mediated by S protein, could also be 276 significantly prevented by EK1C4 with IC 50 ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 nM, as well as 277 author/funder.

Therefore, the selectivity index (SI=CC 50 /IC 50 ) of EK1C4 is >136, suggesting 307 that EK1C4 is a promising SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor with little, or even no, toxic 308 effect in vitro. Further, we explored the potent antiviral mechanism of EK1C4 and 309 found that the complexes of EK1C4/SARS-2HR1, EK1C4/MERS-HR1, and 310 EK1C4/SARS-2HR1 harbor higher stability and increased Tm values than those of the 311 complexes formed by EK1 and HR1s (Fig. S4) . These results suggested that increased 312 antiviral activity of EK1C4 should be related its increased binding affinity with HR1, 313 but their detailed interactions require further studies.

The Post-0.5 group and Post-2 334 group mice showed 100% and 16.7% survival rate, respectively, suggesting that 335 EK1C4 harbors good therapeutic effect after a short period of HCoV-OC43 infection, 336 possibly resulting from the establishment of HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse brain 337 where EK1C4 cannot get through the blood brain barrier via nasal administration 14 .As shown in Fig. S6 , high viral titer was detected in brains of all 5 mice in Pre-24 339 group and 4 out of 5 mice in Post-2 group, but was not detected in brain tissues of all 340 mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, and Post-0.5 groups, while only moderate level of viral 341 titer was detected in brain tissue in one of the 5 mice in Pre-12 group (Fig. S6 a and b) . Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity of 371 SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection 26 . Interestingly, 372 SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in S 373 protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored 374 (Fig. S7) . A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for 375 plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an 376 option for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell 27 .The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVs 378 plays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of the 379 most important targets for drug design. In previous studies, we have found that HR1 380 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailed 381 conformations remain unknown. According to the X-ray crystallographic analysis of 382 the complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b) , it is a typical 6-HB However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateral 387 difference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existing 388 ones in other regions (Fig. 3) .

K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distance 391 of 2.7 Å, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction.In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 in 393 SARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that 394 this new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2 395 domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viral 396 infectivity or transmissibility. A recent study also found that the binding affinity 397 between ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 398 more than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated with 399 the increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 12 .The conjugation of cholesterol to viral entry inhibitor has been proved to be an 401 effective strategy to enhance the antiviral activity, such as C34 peptide for HIV-1 28 .However, the mechanism of this enhancement, especially the role of cholesterol group 403 in the C-terminal tail of entry inhibitor, is still unclear. There is a possibility that the 404 cholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding of 405 inhibitor to the HR1 targets. However, we noticed that binding affinity between 406 EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone, 407 which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly 408 (Fig. S4) . Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted a 409 possible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Fig. S8) .

rzda8x62,"Rigidity, normal modes and flexible motion of a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) protease structure","As of late 2019, there has been global concern over a novel respiratory disease (designated COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO)) which originated in the Wuhan region of China and has subsequently spread to multiple other countries worldwide. The virus causing COVID-19 is a coronavirus with the taxonomic identifier SARS-CoV-2 [1] . Thanks to the diligent efforts of structural biologists, several crystal structures of proteins from SARS-CoV-2 have already been obtained and made available through the Protein Data Bank (PDB) even in advance of journal publication.Crystal structures provide us with detailed structural knowledge of the arrangement of atoms making up a protein or protein complex. A crystal structure is a static snapshot of the protein ""frozen"" into one of its many possible conformations. This static snapshot is rich in implicit information on the natural dynamics which the protein will explore in vivo. These natural dynamics, described by Kern [2] as a protein's ""dynamic personality"", can be critical to a protein's function, and can directly affect the geometry of, for example, an enzyme active site.A judicious combination of simplified methodologiesrigidity analysis, elastic network modelling, and geometric simulation of flexible motioncan work together to extract valuable information on the large-amplitude, low-frequency motions of a protein structure, at a fraction of the computational cost (in resources and time) of molecular dynamics (MD) approaches [3] . These simplified methods are strongly complementary to both computational MD investigations and experimental biophysical/biochemical studies of protein behaviour. enzyme active site geometry [5] [6] [7] [8] ; and, crucially, that a structure generated from geometric simulation of a large amplitude motion can be used as input for further MD investigation [9] , as the geometric simulation retains the local bonding geometry and constraint network of the input crystal structure and forbids major bonding distortions and steric clashes.The information obtained here regarding the flexibility of the enzyme should be of use and interest in structure-based drug design and computational screening of drugs and drug-like molecules capable of binding to and inhibiting the action of the viral protease, such as the pioneering work of Walsh et al. reported online within the past few days [10] . The simulations reported here suggest that the protease structure is capable of substantial flexible motions which alter domain orientations, open and close clefts, and affect the geometry of an inhibitor-binding site. The entirety of the computational work described here was carried out in less than one working day on a laptop computer. The inputs and outputs of the simulations, principally consisting of PDB files representing flexible variations on the protease crystal structures, are available for download from the University of Bath research data archive at https://researchdata.bath.ac.uk/772/ [11] with DOI https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-00772Methods, software and data Input data: crystal structures of a viral protease were downloaded from PDB entries 6Y2E (free protease) and 6LU7 (inhibitor bound).Visualisations: visualisation and some minor structural editing, viz. generation of symmetry copies, removal of water and other heterogroups, removal of alternate sidechain conformations, and renumbering of entries after addition of hydrogens, were carried out with the PyMOL viewer, version 0.99 [12] . All structures were aligned to the 6Y2E crystal structure for consistency of view.Addition of hydrogens, sidechain flipping: the MolProbity [13] web server hosted at Duke University provides online tools carrying out these functions.Rigidity analysis: carried out using the pebble-game constraint counting algorithm implemented in the software FIRST [14] . FIRST should be available from Arizona State University via flexweb.asu.edu; academic readers should contact the present author if there is difficulty in obtaining the software, as the site appears currently to be down. Recent research has shown that the assignment of energies to polar interactions in FIRST suffers from a bug that leads to some salt-bridge interactions with short donoracceptor distances being treated as weak rather than strong. Therefore, interactions were identified and energies assigned using a recently developed corrected function, SBFIRST [15] . A copy of the SBFIRST software for constraint identification is included with the deposited dataset for this study.Normal mode analysis: carried out using the Elnemo elastic network modelling software [16] . This method builds an elastic network model of the protein with one site per residue (using the alpha carbon _CA_ atom coordinates as the node positions), placing springs of uniform strength between each pair of residues lying less than 10 Å apart, and diagonalising the resulting Hessian matrix to identify eigenvectors.Geometric simulations of flexible motion: carried out using the FRODA geometric simulation engine [17] incorporated into FIRST. The FRODA engine iteratively projects an all-atom model of the protein structure along a normal mode direction [3] while constraining the local geometry to match that of the original protein structure. Frames along each such trajectory are written out as numbered PDB files.Workflow and protocol: for each protein structure, the complete workflow for this study is as follows. Download structure in PDB or mmCIF format. In this case, the downloaded structure contains coordinates for a single protein chain, and symmetry operations to generate copies making up the crystal structure.Visualise structure in PyMOL. Generate symmetry mates. Select the appropriate symmetry mate to make up the homodimer indicated in the PDB entry (under Global Stoichiometry) as the biological entity of interest. Delete other symmetry copies. Alter chain ID(s) in the symmetry copy to give each chain a unique chain ID.Process structure through the MolProbity website, adding hydrogens at electron-cloud positions, accepting all recommendations for side chain flips. Download the hydrogenated structure (in which all hydrogens have a serial number of 0).Visualise structure in PyMOL for final cleaning and preparation. Remove alternate conformations (i.e. those with an altloc entry which is not a blank or an A). Remove water molecules and extraneous heterogroups such as glycerol, acetyl etc. Save the cleaned structure; in this step, PyMOL renumbers the atoms sequentially, so hydrogens now have appropriate serial numbers.Identify covalent and noncovalent interactions from the atomic geometry of the protein structure using SBFIRST. This generates lists of covalent bonds, tagged as being either rotatable or non-rotatable (such as the C-N bond in the peptide main chain); hydrophobic tether interactions, wherever two nonpolar sidechains are closely adjacent; and polar interactions, including salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Polar interactions are assigned energies between 0 and -10 kcal/mol based on the donor-hydrogen-acceptor geometry.Analyse rigidity with FIRST as a function of hydrogen-bond energy cutoff. This analysis groups atoms into rigid clusters by matching degrees of freedom against constraints. FIRST can carry out a dilution, gradually lowering the cutoff to exclude polar interactions one by one from weakest to strongest. It is also possible to simply carry out ""snapshots"" of the rigidity at a series of cutoff values, which in this study were -0.0, -0.5, -1.0 … -3.5, -4.0 kcal/mol.Review constraints based on rigidity information. At this stage, a small number of noncovalent constraints (one in 6Y2E, three in 6LU7) were identifiable as artefacts of crystal packing, and were excluded from the network when carrying out the geometric simulations. Based on the rigidity analysis, a cutoff of -3.0 kcal/mol appeared appropriate for the geometric simulations, in line with previous studies [4, 5] .Normal mode analysis. Extract only the alpha carbon positions and run Elnemo pdbmat (generation of matrix) and diagstd (diagonalise matrix) functions. The result is a series of normal modes of motion, reported as eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs. When these are sorted by eigenvalue from lowest to highest, the first six modes are trivial rigid-body motions with near-zero eigenvalues (frequencies), while the low-frequency modes from 7 upwards represent flexible motions of the protein itself. This study examines modes 7 to 16, that is, the ten lowest-frequency nontrivial modes, with modes 7 to 12 being shown in the figures.Geometric simulation of flexible motion. For each normal mode of interest (7 to 16), run FIRST with a chosen energy cutoff (-3.0 kcal/mol) and the previously identified lists of covalent and noncovalent bonding constraints, providing the normal mode eigenvector and a direction of motion (parallel or antiparallel to the vector) along with a directed step size (in this case 0.01Å), and invoking the FRODA engine implemented in FIRST. FRODA carries out a series of steps. In each step, all atom positions are moved along the normal mode direction. Then, the local atomic geometry defined by the bonding constraints and steric exclusion is restored by a few cycles of iterative relaxation. After a userdefined number of steps (in this case 100), a numbered ""frame"" is written out as a PDB file. A series of such frames describes the trajectory of flexible motion. FRODA continues each run until a user-defined maximum number of steps (in this case 1500) or until ""jamming"" occurs where the constraints can no longer be satisfied, typically when the motion has led to severe steric clashes through the collision of two domains.Output data: the inputs, scripts and outputs of the rigidity analysis, normal mode analysis, and geometric simulations for each protein have been deposited in the University of Bath's data repository and are accessible from https://researchdata.bath.ac.uk/772/ [11] Results and discussionThe 6Y2E and 6LU7 crystal structures each contain explicit coordinates for one chain (A) of the protease, and in the case of 6LU7, a chain (C) representing a bound inhibitor. The input structures for analysis and simulation consist of chain A and a symmetry copy (B), making up the biological homodimer. Chain C is likewise duplicated to chain D. The X-ray structure does not contain explicit hydrogens, which are added using MolProbity [13] . With hydrogens added, it is then possible to detect the covalent bonds, polar noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) and hydrophobictether interactions using SBFIRST [15] (see Methods). The polar interactions are rated with an effective energy between 0 and -10 kcal/mol based on the donor-hydrogen-acceptor geometry.Pebble-game rigidity analysis [14, 18] divides the structure into rigid clusters and flexible regions based on the distribution of degrees of freedom and constraints. This rigid cluster decomposition (RCD) depends on the set of polar interactions that are included, based on an energy cutoff that excludes weaker interactions. Information on the relative stability of different portions of the structure is typically obtained at cutoffs around a ""room temperature"" value of -1 kcal/mol. RCDs are shown in Figure 1 . With the inclusion of weaker polar constraints, a single large rigid cluster extends across both chains of the protease dimer. As weaker constraints are eliminated, the large cluster extends across the N-terminal domains (roughly residues 1-200) of both chains, which consist largely of beta-sheet structure, while the largely alpha-helical C-terminal domain breaks up into several smaller rigid clusters, each one a single helix. With further elimination of constraints, the beta-sheet regions become fully flexible. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.986190 doi: bioRxiv preprint Flexible motion of a protein structure is best carried out at with a rigidity cutoff such that the structure is fully flexible. The mobility studies that follow are carried out with a cutoff of -3.0 kcal/mol, similar to previous studies on enzymes [4, 5] . It is important to appreciate that even at this lower cutoff the structure is still thoroughly constrained by noncovalent interactions, as illustrated in Figure 2 . The core of each folded domain is rich in hydrophobic interactions, as is the interface region between the two beta-sheet domains as the two chains form the homodimer, and arrays of strong polar interactions constrain secondary structure (for example, the backbone hydrogen bonds within alpha helices and beta sheets).Noncovalent constraints in the 6LU7 structure, shown as green (hydrophobic) and red (polar) lines. The protein mainchain is shown in cartoon representation. The circled area highlights a small set of interdomain hydrophobic constraints, one between the ALA 285 residues of the two chains, and one each between residue THR 280 of one chain and LEU 286 of the other. In the 6Y2E structure only the ALA 285 interaction is present. These interactions may be considered an artefact of crystal packing.Also highlighted in Figure 2 are a small set of hydrophobic interactions assigned between the N-terminal domains of chains A and B. In the 6Y2E structure, a single tether connects the sidechains of the ALA 285 residues of both chains. In the 6LU7 structure illustrated, there are two additional tethers nearby, each connecting the sidechains of the THR 280 residue of one chain and the LEU 286 of the other. Since the two N-terminal domains are otherwise not connected by noncovalent interactions, and these tethers are not involved in forming a rigid cluster, it seems reasonable to consider these tethers an artefact of crystal packing, and eliminate them from further consideration. Their deletion does not affect the rigid cluster decompositions of the structures. If these tethers were retained, they would somewhat limit (but not entirely prevent) the central cleft-opening motion discussed below.Normal modes, representing directions of motion intrinsic to the structure, are easily obtained from an elastic network model [16] (see Methods) in which the protein is represented as one site per residue and springs of uniform strength are placed between every pair of sites with a separation less than 10 Å. In the 6LU7 structure, the amino acid residues of the bound inhibitor are included in the elastic network. Of the 3N normal modes of a structure with N residues, six modes of near-zero frequency represent the trivial rigid body motions of the structure, while the low-frequency modes from 7 upwards represent modes of flexible motion. When the structure moves along a low-frequency mode direction, the global geometry changes with minimal change in the local geometry, making these directions of ""easy"" motion for the protein. The sign of a normal mode eigenvector is arbitrary; motions parallel and antiparallel to each bias direction must be investigated equally.Linear projection of a protein structure along a normal mode direction would rapidly introduce unphysical distortions into the structure. The geometric simulation approach implemented in FRODA [3, 17] instead applies a bias, moving the structure along a normal mode direction, while maintaining steric exclusion and the bonding geometry and noncovalent constraints of the input structure. This approach rapidly generates physically realistic flexible variations on the input structure which retain all-atom steric and bonding detail.Geometric simulations of the lowest-frequency nontrivial modes of motion (7 upwards) show that the protease structure is capable of substantial amplitudes of easy motion covering several Ångstroms distance in global root-mean-square displacement (RMSD). In particular, the orientations of the alphahelical domains relative to the beta-sheet domains can change through flexing and rotation about the interdomain ""hinges"", and the beta-sheet domains themselves are large enough to display bending and twisting motions within themselves. These variations are illustrated for the 6Y2E structure in Figure 3 and for 6LU7 in Figure 4 . , shown in cartoon representation and coloured from blue to red along each chain. Each flexible variation is the 1000 th frame of a geometric simulation, lying at an all-atom RMSD of 3 to 4 Ångstroms from the starting crystal structure. Note the substantial variations of domain orientation achieved. Each variation is labelled with the normal mode used to bias the geometric simulation, from 7 to 12, and with the direction of bias, parallel (+) or antiparallel (-) to the mode eigenvector, whose sign is arbitrary..

Firstly, flexible motion can open or expose clefts and potential binding sites not directly visible in the static crystal structure. Since the protein in vivo will be exploring its flexible motion thanks to the Brownian-motion driving force of its solvent (e.g. cytosol), such latent sites may constitute valid target areas for inhibitors.Secondly, the global low-frequency motion couples to variations in the binding site/active site geometry [5, 6] . Knowledge of the range of flexible variation here is potentially useful for structurebased drug design and/or fragment screening, since attention can be focussed on candidate molecules that interact robustly with the binding site and tolerate its flexibility, in preference to molecules that interact well only with the crystal structure and not with its flexible variations. 6Y2E crystal structure (a) and cleft opening motion along modes 9-(b) and 11+(c).

The residues are coloured to bring out the chemical character of the amino acid side chains. The portions of the alpha-helical domain surfaces that move aside to open the cleft display largely hydrophobic residues (aliphatic or aromatic side chains). Intriguingly, the exposed surface area within the cleft is richly lined with a series of basic residues (lysine and arginine), and is flanked by acidic (aspartic and glutamic acids) and polar (threonine) residues. In the crystal structures the basic and acidic residues appear to be involved in a network of inter-and intra-domain salt bridge interactions which stabilise the core of the homodimer. An antagonist capable of targeting this zone of strongly polar surface geometry exposed by flexible motion could potentially disrupt the dynamics of the enzyme and interfere with its function.Detail view of interdomain cleft opening (structure 6LU7, mode 11+, 1000 th frame of geometric simulation).

This inhibitor is listed in the PDB as PRD_002214; it is a peptide-like inhibitor, with a central core of amino acids modified at either end with heterogroups, and was previously known to inhibit a protease of a feline coronavirus [19] (see PDB entry 5EU8). In the 6Y2E structure the same binding cleft is empty, which means that its geometry is likely to change in the course of flexible motion of the beta-sheet domain.

Motion biased antiparallel to the mode eigenvector (7-) includes an opening of the cleft, while motion biased parallel to it (7+) closes it. Since the N3 inhibitor is quite deeply embedded in the binding site of the 6LU7 structure, opening and closing of this cleft in the course of the protein's natural motion may be necessary for molecules to access the cleft. On visual inspection, the site in the 6Y2E structure is clearly slightly more closed that in 6LU7, consistent with the proposition that such opening/closing motions are intrinsic to the protein.

hq5um68k,"Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, are broad-spectrum antiviral against RNA viruses including newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","Acute viral infections, such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and the very recent SARS-CoV-2 are an increasing and probably lasting global threat 1 . Broad-spectrum antivirals (BSA) are clinically needed for the effective control of emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases. However, although great efforts have been made by the research community to discover therapeutic antiviral agents for coping with such emergencies, specific and effective drugs or vaccines with low toxicity have been rarely reported 2 . Thus, unfortunately, there is still no effective drugs for the infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at present, which outbreak in December 2019 firstly identified by several Chinese groups [3] [4] [5] , and now has quickly spread throughout China and to more than 90 other countries, infecting 101,923 patients and killing 3486 ones by March 7, 2020 6 .Discovery of nucleoside or nucleotide analogs and host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) are two main strategies for developing BSA [7] [8] [9] . With the former drug class usually causing drug resistance and toxicity, the discovery of HTAs has attracted much attention 10 . Several independent studies searching for HTAs collectively end up to compounds targeting the host's pyrimidine synthesis pathway to inhibit virus infections, which indicates that the replication of viruses is widely dependent on the host pyrimidine synthesis [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, most of these compounds lack verified drug targets making subsequent drug optimization and further application impossible 11, [13] [14] [15] [17] [18] [19] 21, 25 .There are only a few inhibitors against pyrimidine synthesis that can be carried forward to animal studies, however, their antiviral efficacies were unsatisfactory or even ineffective at all 12, 16, 17, 21, [23] [24] [25] . For example, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor FA-613 without a specific target protected only 30.7% of mice from lethal influenza A virus infection when compared to the DAA drug Zanamivir (100%) in parallel 23 . Another two compounds, Cmp1 24 and FK778 25 , which target DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in the fourth step of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, could only inhibit the DNA virus (CMV) replication in RAG -/mice, but their therapeutic effects on the upcoming diseases were unexplored. Therefore, more potent pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors, especially ones with the specific drug target, are urgent to be developed to prove whether such an HTA drug is valuable towards clinical use or has any advantages over DAA drugs in antiviral treatment.To identify potent and low-toxicity DHODH inhibitors (DHODHi), we previously conducted a hierarchal structure-based virtual screening (Fig. 1A) against ~280,000 compounds library towards the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH 26 . We finally obtained two highly potent DHODHi S312 and S416 with IC50s of 29.2 nM and 7.5 nM through structural optimization 27, 28 , which are > 10-folds potent than the FDA approved DHODHi Teriflunomide (IC50 of 307.1 nM). By using these two potent inhibitors, we could fully evaluate DHODH as a valuable host target both in infected cells and in vivo in infected animals. We identified that targeting DHODH offers broad-spectrum antiviral efficacies against various RNA viruses, including the DAA-resistant influenza virus and the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Especially, our potent DHODHi can protect 100% mice from lethal influenza challenge, which is as good as the DAA drugs, and is even effective in the late phase of infection when DAA drug is no longer responding.By determination of the X-ray crystal structure of DHODH in complex with S416( Supplementary Data Fig. 1A, Table S1 ), we verified the binding mode of S416 at the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH that similar to S312. The binding free energies for S312 and S416 were -45.06 and -46.74 kJ/mol, and the binding equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were 20.3 and 1.69 nM, respectively ( Fig. 1B and 1C) .Additionally, the two inhibitors exhibited a clear trait of fast-associating (kon) and slowdissociating (koff) inhibition (Table S2) , providing themselves as ideal drug candidates with a high level of target occupancy. Moreover, S312 and S416 showed proper halflives (8.20 and 9.12 h, respectively) ( Table S3) , which are much shorter than that of Teriflunomide and Leflunomide, indicating that they may have less possibility to bring side effects from drug accumulation in the body (Supplementary Data Fig. 1B and   1C ).To examine the antiviral activities of these DHODHi, we use the influenza A virus as a model virus. A labor stain of A/WSN/33(H1N1, WSN) with 20 TCID50 was applied to infect MDCK cells, and serial dilutions of drugs (DMSO as controls) were added at the same time when cells were infected. Drug efficacies were evaluated by quantification of cell viability in both infected and non-infected cells, and the halfmaximal effective concentration (EC50) and the half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the indicated drug were obtained accordingly. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated by CC50/EC50. As shown in Fig. 1D , the antiviral effect of Leflunomide is hardly detectable at the cell culture level (EC50>25 μ M). However, Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of Leflunomide, exhibited a clear antiviral effect against the WSN virus (EC50=29.33μM, CC50=178.50μM，SI=6.08). As compared to Teriflunomide, the potent DHODHi S312 is ~12-fold stronger (EC50=2.36μM) and S416 is ~480-fold stronger (EC50=0.061μM) than Teriflunomide in their antiviral efficacies. We also tested different influenza A virus subtypes of H3N2 and H9N2. The antiviral efficacies of DHODHi followed the same pattern as they were against H1N1, which is S416>S312>Teriflunomide>Leflunomide in viral inhibitory efficacies (summarized in Table 1 ). The drug effective curve of S416 to H3N2 (EC50=0.013μM) and H9N2 (EC50=0.020μM) is shown in Fig. 1E and 1F . When we compared the drug efficacy by virus plaque assay, the results in Fig. 1G showed that the positive control DAA drug Oseltamivir (Osel) could reduce the plaque size to needlepoint size. However, the virus plaque in equivalent S312-treatment was not observable at all indicating that S312 is more efficient in inhibiting virus replication than Osel.The results in all indicate that DHODHi, especially S312 and S416 exhibited direct antiviral activities to different subtypes of influenza A viruses by shutting off virus multiplication more thoroughly than Osel.As all actuate infectious viruses rely on cellular pyrimidine synthesis process to replicate, it is reasonable to speculate that DHODHi have broad-spectrum antiviral efficacies. We, therefore, tested several highly impacted acute infectious RNA viruses.All compounds of Teriflunomide, Brequinar, S312, and S416, showed inhibitory effects against Ebola virus (EBOV) mini-replicon, with EC50 of 6.43, 0.102, 14.96 and 0.018μM, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . To our supersize, S416 showing relatively high cytotoxicity in MDCK cells (CC50=1.64μM in Fig.1D ) was less toxic to EBOV-minireplicon supporting BSR-T7/5 cells (CC50=85.84μM). Thus, a significantly high SI=4746.11 was achieved by S416. We subsequently tested the inhibitory effects of DHODHi against Zika virus (Fig. 2B) . EC50 values were 17.72, 0.268, 2.29 and 0.021μM for Teriflunomide, Brequinar, S312 and S416, respectively. Again, the selective index of S416 reached the top of SI=1087.62.When we prepared the manuscript, a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in Wuhan in December 2019, we responded quickly to examine the antiviral activity of DHODHi against this new coronavirus. The data in Fig. 2C showed that all the DHODHi tested is low toxic to SARS-CoV-2 susceptible Vero E6 cells. Teriflunomide had a solid antiviral efficacy of EC50=26.06uM (at MOI=0.05, ~2.4-fold stronger than Favipiravir [EC50=61.88μM] 29 ) (Fig. 2C upper right) , whereas its pro-drug Leflunomide showed less inhibition of EC50=63.56uM (data not shown). We therefore further did immuno-florescent assay to visualize the drug efficacy. To determine more carefully the efficacy of Teriflunomide, which can be transferred to clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 immediately as an approved drug, a bit low MOI of 0.03 (Fig. 2C upper left) were applied. In this condition, the EC50 of Teriflunomide could reach 6μM with SI>33, indicating that Teriflunomide with effective EC50 and SI values have all the potentials to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease as an 'old drug in new use' option.Additionally, S312 and S416 exhibited ideal antiviral efficacies of EC50=1.55μM (SI>64.62) and EC50=0.017μM (extensively high SI>5882.4), respectively ( Fig. 2C lower panel). Compared with our previous publication of Remdesivir (EC50=0.77μM, SI>129.87) and Chloroquine (EC50=1.13μM, SI>88.5) 29 , which are currently used in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, S416 had much greater EC50 and SI values (66.5fold stronger than Chloroquine in EC50) against SARS-CoV-2. The data in Fig. 2D clearly showed that as little as 4.6nM (0.3EC50) of S416 can dramatically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections, while, increased drug concentration of 370nM (22EC50) could further eliminate viral infected cells. Thus, S416 turns to be the best efficient chemical so far against SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level.In all the previous studies, inhibitors to DHODH or pyrimidine synthesis pathway were Fig. 3A) . The data in Fig. 3B showed that the bodyweights of mice from the DMSO-treated 'virus group' all dropped to less than 75% and died at D8 p.i.. DAA drug of Osel could indeed totally rescue all the mice from bodyweight loss and death. Equivalently, S312 (5mg/kg, red line) was also able to confer 100% protection and little bodyweight loss similar to Osel. Even S312 of 2.5mg/kg and 10mg/kg cold confer 75% protection and 50% protection, respectively.Considering the Cmax of S312 (≈15μM), we used both 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg in the following experiments. The results suggest that S312 of a modest dose (5mg/kg) would achieve the equivalent 100% protection to DAA drug when used from the beginning of infection.Except for broad active to different viruses, HTA drug such as DHODHi has another advantage over DAA drug to overcome drug-resistant. To prove this, we generated a current-circulating Oseltamivir-resistant NA H275Y mutant virus (in WSN backbone) by reverse genetics (Supplementary data Fig. 2A and 2B) . We found that the NA H275Y virus did not respond to Osel (20mg/kg/day)-treatment at all but 2.5mg/kg/day of S312 can rescue 50% of mice from lethal infection of NA H275Y virus (Supplementary data Fig. 2C ). When mice were infected with a natural-isolated pandemic strain SC09, which is less sensitive to either Osel (40% protection) or S312 (20% protection) ( Fig.   3C ), we further observed 100% protection in combined treatment of S312+Osel, indicating that HTA and DAA drug combination can augment therapeutic effects.The data in all refresh DHODH as an attractive host target in treating viral disease with equivalent efficacy to DAA drug, and is advantageous when facing DAA-drugresistant viruses.To elucidate the essential role of DHODH in the viral replication cycle, we generated a DHODH -/-A549 cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 gene knock-off (KO) technology (Fig. 4A) .Unexpectedly, the cell proliferation rate was barely affected in DHODH -/cells indicating DHODH is not indispensable for cell growth at least for three days (72 hours). CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). By contrast, virus growth was largely inhibited in DHODH -/cells as compared to wild-type (WT) A549 cells with almost 1000-fold reduction of infectious particles at 72 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 4B) . When S312 (5IC50) was added into the culture medium, dramatic reduction of virus growth only occurred in WT cells but not in DHODH -/cells ( Fig. 4C and 4D) . These results prove that virus growth but not the coincident cell growth requires DHODH activity, and antiviral action of S312 is implemented by targeting DHODH.The general virus growth cycle includes virus entry, viral genome replication, and virus release. To further validate virus genome replication is the major target of DHODHi, we used the influenza-A-virus mini-replicon system to quantify viral genome replication. Brequinar, another potent inhibitor of DHODH was included as a positive control 30 , whereas, Osel targeting influenza NA protein served as a negative control. The results in Fig.4E showed no inhibition on viral genome replication in the Osel-treated group, but there were obvious inhibitions on viral genome replication in both S312-and S416-treated groups as well as Brequinar-treated group in dosedependent manners. Almost 90% of viral genome replication was suppressed by 10IC50 of S312 (24μM) and S416 (0.6μM). As DHODH catalyzes oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to produce orotic acid (ORO) and finally forms UTP and CTP， we add four nucleotides (adenine nucleotide(A), guanine nucleotide(G), uracil nucleotide(U), and cytosine nucleotide(C)), DHO, ORO respectively to mini-replicon system to identify the target of S312 and S416. The results in Fig. 4F showed that the addition of 50μM either U or C could effectively rescue viral genome replication in S312-and S416-treated cells (as well as Brequinar-treated cells), whereas addition of neither A nor G changed the inhibitory effects. Moreover, supplement of DHODH substrate DHO cannot rescue viral genome replication (Fig. 4G) , but a supplement of DHODH product ORO can gradually reverse the inhibition effects of S312 and S416 (Fig. 4H) . The results further confirm that compounds S312 and S416 inhibit viral genome replication via targeting DHODH and interrupting the fourth step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . S312 is advantageous over the DAA drug to treat advanced and late-phase disease with decreasing cytokine/chemokine storm.It is documented elsewhere that DAA drugs such as Osel is only completely effective in the early phase of infection, optimally within 48 hours of symptom onset 31 . And till now, there is no approved drug to treat advanced influenza disease at the late phase specifically. We suppose that S312 could be effective in the middle or late phase of disease because it targets a host pro-viral factor of DHODH not affected by viral replication cycle. To test this, we compared the therapeutic windows of S312 and Osel in early (D3-D7), middle & late (D5-D9)，severe late (D7-D11 or D6-D14) phases (workflow shown in Fig. 5A ). When drugs were given in the early phase, both Oseltreatment and 'Osel+S312'-combination-treatment conferred 100% protection (Fig.   5B ). When drugs were given at the middle & late phase (Fig. 5C) , single Osel-treatment wholly lost its antiviral effect with no surviving. However, S312-treatment could provide 50% protection, and drug combination reached to 100% protection. When drugs were given at severe late phase of disease that mice were starting dying (Fig. 5D) , neither single treatment of Osel nor S312 can rescue the mice from death but combined treatment still conferred to 25% survival. To really show the advantage of S312 in treating severe disease, we additionally treated the mice a bit early before dying around 80% of initial weights (D6-D14) with a more optimal dose of S312 (5mg/kg). The data in Fig. 5E showed that S312 rescued 50% of mice from severe body-weight losses, and combined treatment coffered additional 25% survival. These results once again highlight that S312 has remarkable advantages over Osel to treat severe diseases at the late phase, and its therapeutic effectiveness could even be improved when S312 was combined with DAA drug.It is known that severe acute infections including influenza and COVID-19 always induce pathogenic immunity as cytokine/chemokine storms. Leflunomide and Teriflunomide are already clinically used in autoimmune disease to inhibit pathogenic cytokines and chemokines. We, therefore, suspect that DHODHi should also be anticytokine-storm in viral infectious disease. BALF from either Osel-or 'S312+Osel'treated mice were collected at D14 in an independently repeated experiment with a . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . lower infection dose. A parallel body weights excluded differences in virus load (Supplementary Fig. 4A) . The data in Supplementary Fig. 4B showed that the pathogenic inflammatory cytokines in 'S312+Osel'-treated group was largely reduced as compared to Osel-treated mouse in the levels of IL6, MCP-1, IL5, KC/GRO(CXCL1), IL2, IFN-γ, IP-10, IL9, TNF-α, GM-CSF, EPO, IL12p70, MIP3α and IL17A/F (listed in the order of reduce significance).The results in all provide striking information that DHODH inhibitors are effective in infected animals not only by inhibiting virus replication (Shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) but also by eliminating excessive cytokine/chemokine storm. Usage of DHODHi could finally benefit to advanced disease in late infection. In this study, we applied DHODH inhibitors including a computer-aided designed compound S312 into viral infectious disease. We found that direct-targeting DHODHi are broad-spectrum antiviral both in cell culture and in vivo. The candidate S312 had further advantage to be used in infected animals with low toxicity and high efficiency.Moreover, S312 can rescue severe influenza infection by limiting inflammatory cytokine storm in vivo.DHODH is a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the fourth step in pyrimidine de novo synthesis. It catalyzes the dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotic acid (ORO) to finally generate Uridine (U) and Cytosine (C) to supply nucleotide resources in a cell. Under normal conditions, nucleotides are supplied via both de novo biosynthesis and salvage pathways, the latter of which is a way of recycling pre-existing nucleotides from food or other nutrition. However, in virus-infected cells, a large intracellular nucleotide pool is demanded by rapid viral replication. It is therefore reasonable that de novo nucleotides biosynthesis rather than salvage pathway is more critical for virus replication. Our data indeed show that virus replication is largely restricted when the DHODH gene was knocked off even with a complete culture medium. By contrast, cell growth was not affected by lacking DHODH at all, indicating that de novo nucleotides biosynthesis is not indispensable in normal cell growth without infection at least for days. More interestingly, we notice that compared with DNA viruses, RNA viruses need unique UMP but not TMP in their genomes. UMP is the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . particular nucleoside produced by DHODH, which means RNA viruses might be more sensitive to DHODH activity. SARS-CoV-2, for instance, has around 32% of UMP in its genome explaining why DHODHi are effective and superior to SARS-CoV-2.Nevertheless, the comparison between different viruses is worth to be studied in the future.Although several DHODHi have been documented to be antiviral by high-throughput screening [34] [35] [36] [37] . Most of these compounds are still at cell culture level with unknown in vivo efficacy. Therefore, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting DHODH is still an exciting avenue in antiviral research. S312 and S416 present more potent inhibition and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, moreover, the half-lives of S312 and S416 (8.20 and 9.12 h, respectively) are much shorter and more appropriate than that of Teriflunomide, indicating that they may have less possibility to bring toxic side effects from drug accumulation in the body. Strikingly, S312 showed active effects in vivo in lethal dose infection of influenza A viruses not only when used from the beginning of infection but also in the late phase when DAA drug is not responding anymore. Another surprise is the high SI value of S416 to against Zika (SI=1087.62), Ebola (SI=4746.11), and the current SARS-CoV-2 (SI>5882). These data interpreted that S416 is highly promising to develop further as it should be to S312. The extremely high SI of S416 may be due to its high binding affinity and favorable occupation of the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH with faster-associating characteristics (kon = 1.76×10 6 M -1 s -1 ) and slower dissociating binding characteristic (koff=2.97×10 -3 s -1 ), which will reduce the possibility of off-target in vivo.Acute viral infections usually cause severe complications associated with hyper induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is also known as ""cytokine storm"" firstly named in severe influenza disease 38, 39 . Several studies showed that lethal SARS patients expressed high serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TGFβ) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL9, and IL-8) compared to uncomplicated SARS patients [40] [41] [42] [43] . Similarly, in severe COVID-19 cases, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα compared to non-ICU patients 44 .

In terms of treatment, immunomodulatory agents can reduce mortality and organ injury of severe influenza. However, these immunomodulatory are mostly non-specific to viral infection but rather a systemic regulation, such as corticosteroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or angiotensin receptor blockers [46] [47] [48] [49] . Leflunomide and its active metabolite Teriflunomide have been approved for clinical treatment for excessive inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 50 .Our data once again proved that DHODHi could further reduce cytokine storm than DAA drugs when using influenza-A-virus infected animal as a model. We believe that a similar immune-regulating role of DHODHi will exist in COVID-19 patients. Thus, by targeting DHODH, the single key enzyme in viral genome replication and immuneregulation, a dual-action of DHODH can be realized in fighting against a broad spectrum of viruses and the corresponding pathogenic-inflammation in severe infections. We hope our study may quickly and finally benefit the patients now suffering from severe COVID-19 and other infectious diseases caused by emerging and reemerging viruses.

qebbkr6d,A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19,"The outbreak of the pneumonia named COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) has infected over 110,000 people worldwide by 8th March, 2020. Apart from China, other countries or regions including South Korea, Iran, and Europe have reported a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, implying that this novel coronavirus has posed a global health threat. Under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines against SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting COVID-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading. Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) [1, 2, 3] to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials. Those existing drugs with potent antiviral efficacy can be directly applied to treat COVID-19 in a short time, as their safety has been verified in principle in clinical trials.In this study, we applied a data-driven framework that combines both machine learning and statistical analysis methods to systematically integrate large-scale available coronavirus-related data and identify the drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 from a set of over 6000 drug candidates (mainly including approved, investigational and experimental drugs). Our in silico screening process followed by experimental validation revealed that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may serve as a potential drug candidate to treat Our in vitro assays demonstrated that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner and with no obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we found that in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced production of IL-6, which has been reported previously to be of high relevance to the viral pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially for those intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Further in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies in rats and monkeys showed that CVL218 was highly distributed in the lung tissue and no apparent sign of toxicity was observed, which makes it an appealing potential drug candidate for the treatment of the novel pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, our molecular docking study suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible mode of its antiviral action against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the data present in this study and previousTo demonstrate that our computational pipeline for drug repositioning can yield reasonably accurate prediction results, we also validated our network-based knowledge mining algorithm ( Figure 1B) using the retrospective data of the two coronaviruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and had been relatively well studied in the literature, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. With the aid of our developed text mining tool BERE, we found that many of the drugs that had been reported previously in the literature to have antiviral activities against the corresponding coronavirus, were also among the top list of our predicted results ( Table 2) . For example, chloroquine, an FDA-approved drug for treating malaria [7] , which was previously reported to exhibit micromolar anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [8] , was also repurposed for targeting the same virus by our prediction framework. Gemcitabine, which was originally approved for treating certain types of cancers [9] , was also predicted for targeting SARS-CoV with validation by previous in vitro studies [10] . Cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor approved as an immunomodulatory drug [11] , was observed to block the replication of SARS-CoV [12] , and also successfully predicted by our approach. Among the predicted top list for MERS-CoV, miltefosine, which was approved for treating leishmaniasis [13] , was previously identified to have anti-MERS-CoV activity [14] . Chlorpromazine and imatinib, which were used for treating schizophrenia [15] and leukemia [16] , respectively, were also selected by our computational pipeline as anti-MERS-CoV drugs and can be validated by previous in vitro experiments [10] . Thus, the above retrospective study illustrated that our computational framework is able to predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus.As PJ-34 is still currently in the pre-clinical trial stage (DrugBank ID: DB08348, [17] ), we selected two PARP1 inhibitors, including olaparib and mefuparib hydrochloride (CVL218) ( Figure S1 ), that are currently FDA-approved and at Phase I clinical trial, 5 author/funder.

We first conducted a pilot experimental test in vitro (Methods) on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of olaparib, CVL218 and several other related drugs (Figure 2A ). We found that both PARP1 inhibitors olaparib and CVL218 exhibited inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 replication. Nevertheless, CVL218showed a much higher inhibition rate than olaparib. More specifically, olaparib inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication by 15.48% at a concentration of 3.2 µM, while CVL218 reached 35 .16% reduction at a concentration of 3 µM.Notably, the antiviral efficacy of CVL218 even surpassed arbidol, which is one of the standard treatments for COVID-19 in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 6) promulgated by the Chinese government (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df 351d7da8aefc2/files/b218cfeb1bc54639af227f922bf6b817.pdf). In particular, arbidol inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication by 21.73% at 3 µM, much lower than that of CVL218 at the same concentration ( Figure 2A ). In contrast, oseltamivir, zanamivir (drugs used for preventing influenza virus infection) and baricitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor, which was recommended in [18] to treat showed no inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 at the concentration of 3 µM or 3.2 µM.Based on the above pilot experimental results, we then chose CVL218 for subsequent experimental studies. Our further in vitro assays (Methods) showed that CVL218 exhibited effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC 50 of 5.12 µM ( Figure 2B ). We also assessed the cytotoxicity of CVL218 by the CCK8 assay (Methods), and found that CVL218 had a CC 50 To systematically assess the inhibitory activities of CVL218 against SARS-CoV-2, we also performed a time-of-addition assay (Methods) to determine at which stage CVL218 inhibits viral infection. Remdesivir, which has entered the clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656), was also tested in this assay for comparison. In particular, as compared to the DMSO control group, both CVL218 and remdesivir showed potent antiviral activities during the full-time procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (Figure 2D ). The results of the time-of-addition assay indicated that CVL218 can partially work against the viral entry and significantly inhibit the replication of virus post-entry, while the remdesivir can only function at the post-entry stage ( Figure 2D , 2E). All together, the results of these in vitro assays indicated that CVL218 can be further evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19.Recently it has become evident that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the most important cytokines during viral infection [19] , and emerging clinical studies in humans and animals have linked the excessive synthesis of IL-6 with the persistence of many viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [20] , foot and mouth disease virus [21] and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [22] . In addition, an in vivo study in the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model showed that IL-6 blockage can reduce viral loads and enhance virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity [23] . These findings supported a hypothesis that rapid production of IL-6 might be a possible mechanism leading to the deleterious clinical manifestations in viral pathogenesis [24] . Recently published researches on the clinical characteristics of severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that IL-6 was significantly elevated especially in those ICU patients, which caused excessive activated immune response [25, 26, 27, 28, 29] . The pathological role of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated that IL-6 blockade may provide a feasible therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.To test whether CVL218 is able to regulate the IL-6 production in vitro, we stimulated the IL-6 production of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) by CpG-ODN 1826, which is an effective stimulator of cytokines and chemokines. Incubation of PBMCs with 1 µM CpG-ODN 1826 for 6 h (Methods) induced IL-6 production by 40%, when compared to untreated cells ( Figure 3 ). In the presence of CVL218, the stimulatory effect of CpG-ODN 1826 was counteracted. Further study showed that CVL218 inhibited the CpG-induced IL-6 upregulation in a time-and dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ). More specifically, exposure with CVL218 at concentrations 1 µM and 3 µM for 12 h attenuated the CpG-induced IL-6 production by 50% and 72.65%, respectively. These results provided an in vitro evidence to support CVL218 as a potential therapeutic agent for treating pro-inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.2.5. CVL218 possesses good pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic characteristics in animals 2.5.1. CVL218 has the highest tissue distribution in lung of rats We further performed in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation of CVL218 in animals (Methods). We first examined the concentrations of CVL218 over different tissues in rats at different time points post oral administration at different doses (Figure S2 and Table S2 ), which was also previously reported in [30] . Among seven tissues (i.e., lung, spleen, liver, kidney, stomach, heart and brain), we observed that lung had the highest CVL218 concentration, which was 188-fold higher compared to that of plasma ( Table 3 ). The observation that lung had the highest concentration of CVL218 was in line with the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the most pathological impact in lung with high viral loads, which suggested that CVL218 has the potential to be used for the indications of the lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, if its antiviral profile can be established in animal models and clinical trials. 8 author/funder.

We found that the pharmacokinetic parameters of CVL218 and arbidol were comparable, with similar plasma concentrations and drug exposures (Table S3) . Arbidol was mostly distributed in stomach and plasma post administration in rats. In contrast, higher distributions of CVL218 in tissues especially in lung rather than plasma compared to those of arbidol indicated a superior pharmacokinetic profile of CVL218, which may render it as a better potential antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung.In rats after being orally administrated 20/60/160 mg/kg of CVL218 for 28 consecutive days and followed by 28 more days without drug administration (Methods), we observed no significant difference in body weight of rats among different dosage and the control groups ( Figure 4A ). We next conducted a toxicokinetic analysis of CVL218 in rats (Methods). In particular, rats were given CVL218 20/60/160 mg/kg by oral gavage once a day for consecutive 28 days, followed by 28 days without CVL218 administration, to investigate the reversibility of the toxic effects of the compound and examine whether there is any potential delayed-onset toxicity of this drug in rats. The results showed that, the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) were 160 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The exposure of female rats to CVL218 (AUC 0−24 ) was 7605 h·ng/mL in day 1 and 6657 h·ng/mL in day 28, while that of male rats (AUC 0−24 ) was 9102 h·ng/mL in day 1 and 10253 h·ng/mL in day 28 (Table S4) .Based on the toxicokinetic results from the repeated dose studies, all rats survived after a 28-day treatment period and showed no apparent signs of toxicity. 9 author/funder.

Only a slight decrease of body weight was observed in the highdose (80 mg/kg) group, and all changes were reversed after a 28-day recovery period Overall, the above in vivo data showed that CVL218 possesses good pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic characteristics in rats and monkeys, and its high-level distribution in the therapeutically targeted tissue (i.e., lung) may greatly favor the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.As the previous studies have reported that the PARP1 inhibitor PJ-34 can target the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein to reduce its RNA binding and thus impede viral replication [31, 32, 33] , we speculated that olaparib and CVL218 may also interact with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 to perform the similar antiviral function. To test this hypothesis, we conducted molecular docking to study the potential interactions between these two drugs and the N-NTD of SARS-CoV-2 (Methods).The overall structure of HCoV-OC43 (another coronavirus phylogenetically closely related to SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 share similar compositions of secondary structure elements, including five conserved β strands and flexible loops ( Figure 5A ).In addition, their sequences covering the corresponding binding pocket regions are well conserved ( Figure 5C ). Thus, their structures may provide common molecular features in terms of interactions with small molecules at this binding pocket. Therefore, we also used the experimentally solved structure of HCoV-OC43-N-NTD complexed with PJ-34 as a reference to analyze our docking results.Our docking results (more details can also be found in Supplementary In this study we reported a top down data integration approach by combining both machine learning and statistical analysis techniques, followed by web-lab experimental validation, to identify potential drug candidates for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our in silico drug repurposing framework may have the therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Although we mainly conducted in vitro assays to experimentally validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of olaparib and CVL218 due to limited time, it is natural to speculate that other PARP1 inhibitors may also have antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on our computational prediction and experimental validation results.Based on the data present in this study and the previously known evidences reported in the literature, we propose several potential mechanisms to help understand the involvement of PARP1 inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19 ( Figure 6 ). First, during the life cycle of the coronavirus, PARP1 inhibitors may inhibit the viral growth through suppressing viral replication and impeding the binding of the nucleocapsid protein to viral RNAs [31, 34, 35, 36] , which can also be supported by our molecular docking results (see Section 2.6). Second, PARP1 inhibitors have been previously reported to play a critical role in regulating inflammatory response by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as NF-κB, AP-1, IL-6 and downstream cytokines and chemokines [37, 38, 39, 40] . Also, it has been shown that the overactivation of PARP1 promotes energy (NAD + /ATP) consumption and drives cell death, exacerbating the inflammation response [37, 38, 39, 41] . PARP1 inhibitors thus may repress the NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory signals, and reduce energy failure and subsequent cell death induced by necrosis, thus providing a clinical potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.Third, ADP-ribosylation is a conserved post-translational modification on the nucleocapsid proteins across different coronavirus lineages, implying that it may have an important regulatory role for the structure packing of viral genome. Several previous studies have demonstrated that PARP1 is critical for viral replication [35, 42, 43] . For example, PARP1 has been reported to interact with hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (IAV) and promote its replication by triggering the degradation of host type I IFN receptor [44] . In addition, the ADP-ribosylation of adenoviral core proteins displays an antiviral defense mechanism [34] . Therefore, intervening the ADP-ribosylation mediated interplay between PARP1 and viral proteins may be another important pathway for PARP1 inhibitors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of course, to throughly understand the anti-SARS-CoV-2 roles of PARP1 inhibitors, more experimental studies and direct (clinical) evidences will be needed in the future.Considering the pro-inflammatory role of PARP1, the therapeutic effects of PARP1 inhibitors in inflammatory-mediated diseases have been extensively studied over past two decades [45, 46] . PJ-34, the early generation PARP1 inhibitor, has been suggested in previous studies to have neuroprotective effects in stroke model and protect mice from necroptosis-associated liver injuries by repressing the IL-33 expression [47, 48] .In addition, the FDA-approved PARP1 inhibitor, olaparib, has been reported to protect against the LPS (Lipopolysaccharide)-induced acute lung and kidney injuries in a NF-κB-dependent manner in mice [49] . Numerous pre-clinical studies demonstrated that PARP1 inhibitors play an essential role in a range of inflammatory injuries and related diseases, especially the lung inflammatory disorders including ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and asthma [40, 46, 50, 51] . All these studies suggest that PARP1 inhibitors are of high relevance to the treatment of the novel pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly via their roles in modulating inflammatory response.Notably, current pathological studies have shown that the severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 generally have higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN-γ [25, 27, 28, 29] , implying a high risk of the inflammatory-associated cytokine storm after viral infection. In addition, reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells have also been observed in COVID-19 patients [27] . Therefore, blocking the overactive inflammatory response may be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, particularly for those ICU patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Our in vitro study has showed that CVL218 can effectively inhibit the IL-6 production induced by CpG in PBMCs ( Figure 3 ). This finding indicates that CVL218 may also possess the IL-6 specific anti-inflammatory effect that is applicable to those severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.PARP1 inhibitors are originally used for targeting homologous recombination repair defects in cancers, and mainly categorized as oncology drugs. Thus, it would generally need more safety data to justify any repurposing of PARP1 inhibitors for non-oncology indications. Fortunately, there are numerous existing pre-clinical and clinical studies on repurposing PARP1 inhibitors into non-oncological diseases, including the aforementioned acute diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke) [52] and chronic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and vascular diseases) [52, 53] . All these evidences indicate the possibility of repurposing PARP1 inhibitors as a safe therapeutic agent to treat the current acute lung disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, our pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic data in rats and monkeys shown in our study indicate that CVL218 may have a relatively acceptable safety profile to be repositioned for the antiviral purpose. Moreover, CVL218 has been approved to enter Phase I clinical trial in 2017 by National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China for cancer treatment. The preliminary data from the Phase I clinical trial have shown that CVL218 is well tolerated in ascending dose studies at doses as high as 1000 mg QD and 500 mg BID, and no Grade II and above adverse events have been observed, which indicates that CVL218 is also quite safe and well tolerated in human.Our pharmacokinetic examination in rats has shown that CVL218 has the highest 14 author/funder.

Such a tissue specific enrichment in lung may bring an extra advantage for CVL218 to be used for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 purpose, as lung is the therapeutically targeted tissue for COVID-19. Moreover, high level distribution in lung may also suggest that only low dosage is needed in order to ensure the therapeutic efficacy of CVL218 against SARS-CoV-2, which may further reduce the risk of adverse events.Thus, CVL218 may have great potential to be repurposed as an effective therapeutic agent to combat SARS-CoV-2 and prevent future epidemic outbreak.15 author/funder.

MethodsThe virus-related knowledge graph was constructed for predicting the coronavirus related drugs. In total seven networks were considered in the constructed knowledge graph (Figure 1B) , including a human target-drug interaction network, a virus target-drug interaction network, a human protein-protein interaction network, a virus protein-human protein interaction network, a drug molecular similarity network, a human protein sequence similarity network, and a virus protein sequence similarity network. The human target-drug interaction network was derived from DrugBank (version 5.1.0) [17] . The virus target-drug interaction network was constructed from the integrated data from DrugBank (version 5.1.0) [17] , ChEMBL (release 26) [54] , TTD (last update 11 Nov, 2019) [55] , IUPHAR BPS (release 13, Nov, 2019) [56] , BindindDB [57] and GHDDI (https://ghddi-ailab.github.io/Targeting2019-nCo V/CoV_Experiment_Data/), with a cut-off threshold of IC 50 /EC 50 /K i /K d <10 µM. The human protein-protein interaction network and the virus protein-human protein interaction network were constructed from the integrated data from BioGRID (release 3.5.181) [58] , HuRI [59] , Instruct [60] , MINT (2012 update) [61] , PINA (V2.0) [62] , SignaLink (V2.0) [63] and innatedb [64] . The drug molecular similarity network was obtained by calculating the Tanimoto similarities from Morgan fingerprints with a radius of 2 computed using the rdkit tool [65] . The protein sequence similarity networks of both human and virus were obtained by calculating the Smith-Waterman similarities of the amino acid sequences derived from UniProt [66] using a sequence alignment software provided in [67] . Noted that we collected additional protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from UniProt [66] and added them into the corresponding networks for the final prediction. Those drugs without drug-target interactions or outside the Drug-Bank database were removed from the corresponding networks. We then constructed the virus-related knowledge graph by merging together all the nodes and edges of the 16 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The constructed knowledge graph G = (V, E) is an undirected graph, in which each node v ∈ V in the node set V belongs to one of the node types (including drugs, human proteins, and virus proteins), and each edge e ∈ E in the edge set E ⊂ V × V × R belongs to one of the relation types from the relation type set R (including two drug-target interactions, two protein-protein interactions and three similarities).The initial list of drug candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 was first screened using a network-based knowledge mining algorithm modified from our previous work [68, 69] .The goal was to capture the hidden virus-related feature information and accurately predict the potential drug candidates from the constructed knowledge graph, which was realized through learning a network topology-preserving embedding for each node.More specifically, our model used a graph convolution algorithm [70] to gather and update feature information for each node in the constructed heterogeneous knowledge graph network from neighborhoods so that the network topology information can be fully exploited. Suppose that we perform T iterations of graph convolution. At iteration 1 ≤ t ≤ T , the message m t v passed to node v can be expressed as:where a v,u,r stands for the weight for edge e = (u, v, r), A u,v,r = av,u,r u av,u,r , W t r ∈ R d×dThen the feature h t v of node v is updated byauthor/funder.

Then the confidence scores were averaged across all the proteins of a certain virus (e.g., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2), and the corresponding p-values were obtained by z-test. For each virus, we selected those predictions with a p-value < 0.05 as drug candidates.We used a deep learning based relation extraction method named BERE [4] to extract the coronavirus related drugs from large-scale literature texts.

For each pair of entities (e 1 , e 2 ), there are usually more than one sentence describing the underlying relations.Therefore, we used a bag of sentences S e 1 ,e 2 , denoting the set of all the sentences mentioning both e 1 and e 2 , to predict the relation between these two entities.We first encoded each sentence s ∈ S e 1 ,e 2 in a semantic and syntactic manner using a hybrid deep neural network (h : s → R d ), including a self-attention module [72] , a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) module [73] and a Gumbel tree-GRU module [4, 74] . Each sentence representation h(s) was then scored by a sentence-level attention module to indicate its contribution to the relation prediction, that is,where β(s) ∈ R stands for the weight score, and W s ∈ R d×1 stands for the learnable weight parameters. Finally, the relation was predicted by a binary classifier, based on the weighted sum of sentence representations, that is, r e 1 ,e 2 = classifierwhere r e 1 ,e 2 stands for the probability of the relation of interest between entities e 1 and e 2 mentioned by the bag of sentences S e 1 ,e 2 .The training corpus we used was curated automatically from nearly 20 million PubMed (http://www.pubmed.gov) abstracts by a distant supervision technique [75] .In detail, the names (or aliases) of drugs or targets in sentences were first annotated by a dictionary-based named entity recognition method (string matching), in which the name dictionary was derived from DrugBank (version 5.1.0) [17] , with ambiguous names (e.g., common words) removed.

The unlabeled corpus that we used in this work for text-mining the coronavirus related drugs was obtained from approximately 2.2 million PMC full-text articles, with entities of interest annotated using the aforementioned named entity recognition approach. A coronavirus related drug was extracted as a hit candidate if the model found a bag of sentences describing a relation between this drug and a target in the coronavirus of interest.We used the transcriptome analysis approach to further filter the potential drug candidates for treating the COVID-19 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the lack of gene expression data from the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, we used those from the SARS-CoV infected patients to screen the potential therapeutic drug candidates against COVID-19. Such a strategy is reasonable as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are two closely related and highly similar coronavirus. First, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to that of SARS-CoV, with about 79% of sequence identity [76] , and the M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) proteins of these two coronaviruses have over 90% sequence similarities [77] . In addition, the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were highly similar [78] .In particularly, we collected the gene expression profiles of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ten SARS-CoV infected patients (GEO:GSE1739) [6] .The raw gene expression values were first converted into logarithm scale, and then the differential expression values (z-scores) were computed by comparing to those of healthy persons using the same protocol as described in [5] , that is,MAD(X healthy ) =median(|X healthy − median(X healthy )|),20 author/funder.

The p-values for all the genes with measured expression values during the analysis were also computed based on the z-scores. The up-and down-regulated genes were then identified using a cut-off threshold of p-value < 10 −10 . We used the connectivity map (CMap) [5] , which contains the cellular gene expression profiles under the perturbation of 2428 well annotated reference compounds, to measure the associations of gene expression patterns between SARS-CoV infected patients and the reference compound-perturbed cells. The connectivity map scores were computed based on the up-and down-regulated gene sets of SARS-CoV infected patients using the web tool (https://clue.io/query). Under the hypothesis that the gene expression pattern resulting from the perturbation by a therapeutic compound should be negatively correlated with that resulting from the coronavirus infection, we selected those compounds that have significant negative connectivity map scores, that is, the list of drug candidates predicted to treat the coronavirus infected patients was obtained by selecting the compounds with the connectivity map scores < −90, which was suggested by the original paper [5] .The African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cell line was purchased from the Cell Resources Center of Shanghai Institute of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences Potential antiviral drugs, including zanamivir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, baricitinib, olaparib and arbidol, were all provided by MCE (Medchem Express, China). The PARP1 inhibitor mefuparib hydrochloride (CVL218) with a purity of more than 99.0% was provided by Convalife, Shanghai, China.The cytotoxicity of the tested drugs on Vero E6 cells was determined by the CCK8 assays (Beyotime, China). At 48 h post addition of the tested drugs, 20 µL CCK8 was added to each well and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h. Then optical density was measured at 450 nm. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, USA). Vero E6 cells were seeded into 96-well plates with a density of 5 × 10 4 cells/well for incubation in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 16 h in an incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37 • C, for cells to reach 80% confluent. Then, cell culture medium of each well was removed, and PBS was used to wash the cells once, before evaluating the antiviral efficacy of the drugs.

For the ""Postentry"" experiment, virus was first added to the cells to allow infection for 2 h before the virus-containing supernatant was replaced with drug-containing medium until the end of the experiment. At 14 h post infection, the viral inhibition in the cell supernatants of the tested drug was quantified by qRT-PCR, and calculated using the DMSO group as reference.Vero E6 cells were treated with CVL218 at 5 µM, 15 µM and 25 µM, respectively, following the same procedure of ""full-time"" treatment. Infected cells were fixed with 80% acetone in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and then blocked with 5% BSA in PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 30 min.

Serum (0.5 mL) was collected to analyze toxicokinetics at different time points post drug administration. The plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using a non-compartmental method (Phoenix, version 1.3, USA) to derive the pharmacokinetic parameters.Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three time point groups (3/sex/group). At 3, 6 and 8h after CVL218 administration, animals were sacrificed, and the brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, stomach and kidney tissues were collected.Tissue samples were washed in ice-cold saline, blotted with paper towel to remove excess fluid, and weighed. Tissue samples were fluid, weighted and stored at −20 ± 2 • C until the determination of drug concentration by LC-MS-MS.Healthy male and female cynomolgus monkeys aged 3-4 years were purchased from Guangdong Landau Biotechnology, China. The animals were maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.Cynomolgus monkey (5/sex/group) were selected using a computerized randomization procedure, and administered CVL218 by nasogastric feeding at dose levels of 0 (control), 5, 20, 80 mg/kg. Individual dose volumes were adjusted weekly based on body weight of monkeys. The monkeys were observed twice daily for viability/mortality and for any change in behavior, reaction to treatment or ill-health. Electrocardiograms, intraocular pressure, rectal temperature and body weight were recorded. For all the groups, 2/3 of the animals were randomly selected and euthanized at day 28. The remaining animals were euthanized after a 28-day drug free period. Blood samples were taken before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-dose on days 1 and 28 of the treatment period.

hj675z1b,Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase,"formed, which is responsible for making more copies of the RNA genome via a negative-sense RNA intermediate, as well as the structural and other proteins encoded by the viral genome. The viral RNA is packaged into viral coats in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex, after which exocytosis results in release of viral particles for subsequent infectious cycles. Potential inhibitors have been designed to target nearly every stage of this process. 3 However, despite decades of research, no effective drug is currently approved to treat serious coronavirus infections such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.One of the most important druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This polymerase is highly conserved at the protein level among different positive sense RNA viruses, to which coronaviruses and HCV belong, and shares common structural features in these viruses. 5 Like RdRps in other viruses, the coronavirus enzyme is highly error-prone, 6 which might increase its ability to accept modified nucleotide analogues. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues that inhibit polymerases are an important group of anti-viral agents. [7] [8] [9] [10] Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 2 Sofosbuvir is a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue prodrug with a hydrophobic masked phosphate group enabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, and then converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 1 ). In this activated form, it inhibits the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. 11, 12 The activated drug (2'-F,Me-UTP) binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to fluoro and methyl modifications at the 2' position, inhibits further RNA chain extension, thereby halting RNA replication and stopping viral growth. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides. Velpatasvir inhibits NS5A, a key protein required for HCV replication. NS5A enhances the function of RNA polymerase NS5B during viral RNA synthesis. 13, 14 Fig. 1 | Conversion of Sofosbuvir to active triphosphate (2'-F,Me-UTP) in vivo to inhibit viral polymerases. Adapted from 11 There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitors that have been evaluated as antiviral drugs. A related purine nucleotide prodrug, Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) , was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections, though not successfully, and is currently in clinical trials for treating COVID-19. 15, 16 In contrast to Sofosbuvir (Fig. 2a) , both the 2'-and 3'-OH groups in Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1' position serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form. In addition to the use of hydrophobic groups to mask the phosphate in the Protide-based prodrug strategy, 17 as with Sofosbuvir and Remdesivir, there are other classes of nucleoside prodrugs including those based on ester derivatives of the ribose hydroxyl groups to enhance cellular delivery. 18,19 The replication cycle of HCV 4 is very similar to that of the coronaviruses. 3 Analyzing the structure of the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (Fig. 2a) compared to that of Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) , both of which have already been shown to inhibit the replication of specific RNA viruses (Sofosbuvir for HCV, Remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2), we noted in particular that the 2'-modifications in Sofosbuvir (a fluoro and a methyl group) are substantially smaller than the 1'-cyano group and the 2'-OH group in Remdesivir. The bulky cyano group in close proximity to the 2'-OH may lead to steric hindrance that will impact the incorporation efficiency of the activated form of Remdesivir. Interestingly, it was recently reported that, using the MERS-CoV polymerase, the triphosphate of Remdesivir was preferentially incorporated relative to ATP in solution assays. 20 Nevertheless, it has been shown that the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir does not cause complete polymerase reaction termination and actually delays polymerase termination in Ebola virus and respiratory syncytial virus, likely due to its 1'-cyano group and the free 2'-OH and 3'-OH groups. 20, 21 Compared to the active form of Sofosbuvir (2'-fluoro-2'-methyl-UTP), two other nucleotide inhibitors with related structures were reviewed: 2'-fluoro-UTP is incorporated by polymerase, but RNA synthesis may continue past the incorporated nucleotide analogue; 22 2'-C-methyl-UTP has been shown to terminate the reaction catalyzed by HCV RdRp, 22 but proofreading mechanisms can revert this inhibition in mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. 23 Additionally, HCV develops resistance to 2'-C-methyl-UTP due to mutations of the RdRp. 24 A computational study published in 2017 25 considered the ability of various anti-HCV drugs to dock in the active site of SARS and MERS coronavirus RdRps as potential inhibitors. Recently, Elfiky used a computational approach to predict that Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir might be potent drugs against . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Our rationale is that the low fidelity viral-like enzymes would incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP and stop further replication, while the high fidelity polymerases, typical of host cell polymerases, would not. Experimental proof for termination of the SARS-CoV polymerase catalyzed RNA replication would provide further support for this rationale, indicating that Sofosbuvir or its modified forms will inhibit SARS-CoV-2.We first carried out DNA polymerase extension reactions with the active form of Sofosbuvir (2'-F,Me-UTP) using Thermo Sequenase as an example of high fidelity, host-like polymerases, and two mutated DNA polymerases which are known to be more promiscuous in their ability to incorporate modified nucleotides, Therminator II and Therminator IX, as examples of viral-like low fidelity enzymes. A DNA template-primer complex, in which the next two available bases were A (Fig. 3 ), was incubated with either 2'-F,Me-UTP (structure shown in Fig. 2a) , or dTTP as a positive control, in the appropriate polymerase buffer. If the 2'-F,Me-UTP is incorporated and inhibits further incorporation, a single-base primer extension product will be produced. By contrast, dTTP incorporation will result in primer extension by 2 bases. After performing the reactions, we determined the molecular weight of the extension products using MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).As seen in Figs. 3a and 3b, when the primer-template complex (sequences shown at top of Fig. 3 ) and 2'-F,Me-UTP were incubated with the low fidelity 9 o N polymerase mutants, 29-31 Therminator II (T2) and Therminator IX (T9), we observed single product peaks with molecular weights of 5492 Da and 5488 Da, indicating single base extension in the polymerase reaction. Thus 2'-F,Me-UTP was able to be incorporated and block further nucleotide incorporation. In contrast, when the extension reactions were carried out with high-fidelity Thermo Sequenase DNA polymerase (TS), 32 there was no incorporation, as evidenced by a single primer peak at 5172 Da (Fig. 3c ). This supports our rationale that Thermo Sequenase, a high fidelity enzyme originally designed for accurate Sanger sequencing, will not incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP, while a lowfidelity polymerase, such as T2 and T9, will incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP and stop further nucleotide incorporation. When dTTP was used as a positive control with these three enzymes, incorporation continued past the first A in the template, resulting in a higher molecular weight peak..

Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating the primer and template with 2'-F,Me-UTP and the appropriate reaction buffer for the specific enzyme, followed by detection of the reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectra for Therminator II (T2) in (a) and for Therminator IX (T9) in (b) indicates single-base incorporation and termination, while the MS spectrum for Thermo Sequenase (TS) in (c) indicates no incorporation, showing only a primer peak. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.These results demonstrate that lower fidelity polymerases will have a high likelihood of incorporating 2'-F,Me-UTP and inhibit viral RNA replication, whereas high fidelity enzymes, more typical of the host DNA and RNA polymerases, will have a low likelihood of being inhibited by 2'-F,Me-UTP. Anti-viral drug design based on this principle may lead to potent viral polymerase inhibitors with fewer side effects. To provide further proof that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp might be inhibited by 2'-F,Me-UTP, we next tested the ability of this molecule to be incorporated into an RNA primer to terminate the reaction catalyzed by the RdRp from SARS-CoV, using an RNA template. As shown in Fig. 4a , the active triphosphate form of the drug not only was incorporated by the RdRp, but prevented further incorporation, behaving as a terminator in the polymerase reaction.Based on our similar insight related to their molecular structures and previous antiviral activity studies, in comparison with Sofosbuvir, we selected the triphosphate forms of Alovudine (3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine) and azidothymidine (AZT, the first FDA approved drug for HIV/AIDS) for evaluation as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RdRp. These two molecules share a similar backbone structure (base and ribose) to Sofosbuvir, but have fewer modification sites and less steric hindrance. Furthermore, because these modifications on Alovudine and AZT are on the 3' carbon in place of the OH group, they directly prevent further incorporation of nucleotides leading to permanent termination of RNA synthesis and replication of the virus. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.989186 doi: bioRxiv preprint Alovudine is one of the most potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 replication. This promising drug was discontinued after a Phase II trial due to its hematological toxicity. 33 However, subsequent in vitro studies showed Alovudine was very effective at suppressing several nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant HIV-1 mutants. 34 New clinical studies were then carried out in which low doses of Alovudine were given as supplements to patients showing evidence of infection by NRTI resistant HIV strains and not responding well to their current drug regimen. A 4-week course of 2 mg/day Alovudine reduced viral load significantly, and was relatively well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. 35 AZT is another antiretroviral medication which has long been used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. [36] [37] [38] Upon entry into the infected cells, similar to Alovudine, cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5'triphosphate form (3'-N 3 -dTTP, structure shown in Fig. 2d ), which competes with dTTP for incorporation into DNA by HIV-reverse transcriptase resulting in termination of HIV's DNA synthesis. 39 Since the side effects and toxicity of AZT are well understood, novel methodologies have been directed at enhancing AZT plasma levels and its bioavailability in all human organs in order to improve its therapeutic efficacy. Among these possibilities, an AZT prodrug strategy was proposed. 40 We thus assessed the ability of 3'-N 3 -dTTP and 3'-F-dTTP, the active triphosphate forms of AZT and Alovudine, along with 2'-F,Me-UTP, to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp into an RNA primer and terminate the polymerase reaction.The RdRp of SARS-CoV, referred to as nsp12, and its two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, shown to be required for the processive polymerase activity of nsp12, were cloned and purified as described. 41, 42 These three viral gene products have high homology (e.g., 96% identity and 98% similarity for nsp12, with similar homology levels at the amino acid level for nsp7 and nsp8) to the equivalent gene products from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. A detailed description of the homologies of nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 is included in Extended Data Fig. 1 which highlights key functional motifs in nsp12 described by Kirchdoerfer and Ward. 42 Of these, Motifs A, B, E, F and G are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at the amino acid level, and Motifs C and D display only conservative substitutions.We performed polymerase extension assays with 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP, 3'-N 3 -dTTP or UTP following the addition of an pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the RdRp (nsp12) and two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). The extended primer products from the reaction were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. The RNA template and primer, corresponding to the N1 epitope region of the N protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, were used for the polymerase assay, and their sequences are indicated at the top of Fig. 4 . Because there are two As in a row in the next available positions of the template for RNA polymerase extension downstream of the priming site, if the 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP or 3'-N 3 -dTTP are incorporated by the viral RdRp, a single nucleotide analogue will be added to the 3'-end of the primer strand. If they are indeed inhibitors of the polymerase, the extension should stop after this incorporation; further 3'extension should be prevented. In the case of the UTP control reaction, two UTP's should be incorporated. As shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2 , this is exactly what we observed. In the MALDI-TOF MS trace in Fig. 4a, a peak In summary, these results demonstrate that the nucleotide analogues 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP and 3'-N 3 -dTTP, are permanent terminators for the SARS-CoV RdRp. Their prodrug versions (Sofosbuvir, 3'-F-5'-Ophosphoramidate dT nucleoside and 3'-N 3 -5'-O-phosphoramidate dT nucleoside) can be readily synthesized using the ProTide prodrug approach, as shown in Fig. 2a, c and d, and can be developed as therapeutics for both SARS and COVID-19.The sequence of the primer and template used for these extension reactions, which are within the N1 coding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, is shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating (a) 2'-F,Me-UTP, (b) 3'-F-dTTP, and (c) 3'-N 3 -dTTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. For comparison, data for extension with UTP are presented in Extended Data Fig. 2 . The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.One factor that has confounded the development of RdRp inhibitors in coronaviruses is the presence of a 3'exonuclease-based proofreading activity such as that associated with nsp14, a key component of the replication-transcription complex in SARS-CoV, 43, 44 and also encoded in SARS-CoV-2. This exonuclease activity can be overcome with the use of 2'-O-methylated nucleotides. 43 Importantly, since both Sofosbuvir . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We previously used this chemical and structural principle to select a variety of chemical moieties that block the 3'-OH of the nucleotide analogues as polymerase terminators. 31, 49, 50 In conclusion, we demonstrated the capability of more tolerant DNA polymerases, as well as SARS CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp responsible for COVID-19, to incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP, the active form of Sofosbuvir, where it serves to terminate the polymerase reaction. We also showed two other nucleotide triphosphates, 3'-F-dTTP, the active form of Alovudine, and 3'-N 3 -dTTP, the active form of AZT, can also be incorporated and terminate further nucleotide extension by the RdRp in the polymerase reaction, potentially preventing further replication of the virus. Prodrug versions of these compounds and their derivatives therefore can be developed as potent broadspectrum therapeutics for coronavirus infectious diseases, including SARS, MERS and COVID-19. which is also less conservative in other coronaviruses. 5 Within the next region (the interface domain, aa ~250 .

The region beyond the interface domain, corresponding to the nsp12 C-terminus, contains polymerase functional domains. These domains constitute the canonical fingers, palm, and thumb of the polymerase enzyme and contain several motifs that are conservative among coronaviruses (Motifs A through F).

tdlcb9bf,Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: preliminary results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial,"In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in China and outside [1, 2] . The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 12 th 2020 [3] . According to a recent Chinese stud, about 80% of patients present with mild disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 79 years and 14.8% in those aged >80 years [4] . However, there is probably an important number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of March 14 th 2020 [5] . Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the transmission in the community. Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of old drugs for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [6, 7] .A recent paper reported an inhibitor effect of remdesivir (a new antiviral drug) and chloroquine (an old antimalarial drug) on the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, [8] and an early clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients, showed that chloroquine had a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance, when comparing to controls groups [9,10]. Chinese experts recommend that patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine, be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten days [11] .Hydroxychloroquine (an analogue of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [12] . Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose [13] and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions [14] . Our team has a very comprehensive experience in successfully treating patients with chronic diseases due to intracellular bacteria (Q fever due to Coxiella burnetii and Whipple's disease due to Tropheryma whipplei) with long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment (600 mg/day for 12 to 18 months) since more than 20 years. [15, 16] We therefore started to conduct a clinical trial aiming at assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients after approval by the French Ministry of Health. In this report we describe our early results, focusing on virological data in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group.This ongoing study is coordinated by The Méditerranée Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille. Patients who were proposed a treatment with hydroxychloroquine were recruited and managed in Marseille centre. Controls without hydroxychloroquine treatment were recruited in Marseille, Nice, Avignon and Briançon centers, all located in South France.Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study if they fulfilled two primary criteria: i) age >12 years; ii) PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 carriage in nasopharyngeal sample at admission whatever their clinical status.Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including retinopathy, G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation.

After centrifigation at 4,000 g, microplates were incubated at 37°C.Plates were observed daily for evidence of cytopathogenic effect.

A significant difference was observed between hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and controls starting even on day3 post-inclusion. These results are of great importance because a recent paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72%µM) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%µM) [14] . These in vitro results corroborate our clinical results. The target values indicated in this paper [14] were reached in our experiments. The safer dose-dependent toxicity profile of hydroxychloroquine in humans, compared to that of chloroquine [13] allows using clinical doses of hydroxychloroquine that will be over its EC50 observed in vitro [14] .Our preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Azithromycin has been shown to be active in vitro against Zika and Ebola viruses [20-22] and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when administrated to patients suffering viral infection [23] . This finding should be further explored to know whether a combination is more effective especially in severe cases.

8prn86g6,Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has now spread to more than 100 countries on 6 continents. SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, and is distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 1 The coronaviruses are single-strand RNA viruses, sharing properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. Coronaviruses, like HCV and the flaviviruses, are positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, 2,3 and these viruses share a similar replication mechanism requiring a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).Potential inhibitors have been designed to target nearly every stage of the viral replication cycle. 2 However, despite decades of research, no effective drug is currently approved to treat serious coronavirus infections such as SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19. One of the most important druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RdRp. This polymerase displays similar catalytic mechanisms and some key conserved amino acids in the active site among different positive sense RNA viruses, to which coronaviruses and HCV belong. 4 Like RdRps in other viruses, the coronavirus enzyme is highly error-prone, 5 which might increase its ability to accept modified nucleotide analogues as substrates. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues that inhibit polymerases are an important group of anti-viral agents. [6] [7] [8] [9] Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). 10 Using polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrated that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir was incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp, and blocked further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (the first FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. Alovudine and AZT share a similar backbone structure (base and ribose) to Sofosbuvir, but have fewer modification sites and less steric hindrance. Furthermore, because these modifications on Alovudine and AZT are on the 3' carbon in place of the OH group, they directly prevent further incorporation of nucleotides leading to permanent termination of RNA synthesis and replication of the virus. We also demonstrated the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. 10 In this paper, we first constructed SARS-CoV-2 RdRp based on a similar procedure to that of SARS-CoV, 11, 12 and then demonstrated that the above three nucleotide analogues ( Fig. 1 a, b , d) are inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Using structure-activity based molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate form of Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, Vemlidy, an acyclic adenosine nucleotide) ( Fig. 1 c) , which is an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, for evaluation as a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor. The results indicated that the active triphosphate form of this molecule, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), also inhibited this polymerase. TAF, a prodrug form of the nucleotide analogue viral polymerase inhibitor, shows potent activity for HIV and HBV, but only limited inhibition of host nuclear and mitochondrial polymerases. 13, 14 It is activated by a series of hydrolases to the deprotected monophosphate form, TFV, and then by two consecutive kinase reactions to TFV-DP. 15 TFV-DP is an acyclic nucleotide and does not have a 3'-OH group. Remarkably, this molecule is incorporated by both HIV and HBV polymerases, terminating nucleic acid elongation and viral replication. 13, 15 In addition, resistance mutations were rarely seen in patients treated with regimens including TAF. 16 In view of the fact that the active triphosphate form of TAF, Tenofovir diphosphate, is much smaller than natural nucleoside triphosphates, we expect that it can easily fit within the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. As a noncyclic nucleotide, TFV-DP lacks a normal sugar ring configuration, and thus we reasoned that it is unlikely to be recognized by 3'-. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We thus assessed the ability of 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP, TFV-DP, and 3'-N 3 -dTTP (the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, TAF and AZT, respectively), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp into an RNA primer and terminate the polymerase reaction.The RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, referred to as nsp12, and its two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, whose homologs were shown to be required for the processive polymerase activity of nsp12 in SARS-CoV, 11, 12 were cloned and purified as described in the Methods. These three viral gene products in SARS-CoV-2 have high homology (e.g., 96% identity and 98% similarity for nsp12, with similar homology levels at the amino acid level for nsp7 and nsp8) to the equivalent gene products from SARS-CoV, the causative agent of SARS. 10 We performed polymerase extension assays with 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP, 3'-N 3 -dTTP or TFV-DP + UTP, following the addition of a pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12) and two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). The extended primer products from the reaction were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. The RNA template and primer, corresponding to the 3' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, were used for the polymerase assay, and their sequences are indicated at the top of Fig. 2 . Because there are two A's in a row in the next available positions of the template for RNA polymerase extension downstream of the priming site, if the 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP or 3'-N 3 -dTTP are incorporated by the viral RdRp, a single nucleotide analogue will be added to the 3'-end of the primer strand. If they are indeed inhibitors of the polymerase, the extension should stop after this incorporation; further 3'extension should be prevented. Because the two A's in the template are followed by 4 U's, in the case of the TFV-DP/UTP mixture, two UTP's should be incorporated prior to the incorporation and termination by TFV-DP, which has an adenosine base. As shown in Fig. 2 , this is exactly what we observed. In the MALDI-TOF MS trace in Fig. 2a , a peak indicative of the molecular weight of a single base primer extension product with one 2'-F,Me-UTP was obtained (6644 Da observed, 6634 Da expected). Similarly, in the trace in Fig.  2b , a single extension peak indicative of a single base extension by 3'-F-dTTP is revealed (6623 Da observed, 6618 Da expected), with no further incorporation. In both of the above cases, the primer was nearly completely extended. In the trace in Fig. 2d , a single extension peak indicative of a single-base extension by 3'-N 3 -dTTP is seen (6633 Da observed, 6641 Da expected), with no evidence of further incorporation, though the incorporation efficiency was lower than for 2'-F,Me-UTP and 3'-F-dTTP, which may require further optimization. Finally, in the trace in Fig. 2c , a peak indicative of the molecular weight of a primer extension product formed by incorporating 2 U's and 1 TFV is found (7198 Da observed, 7193 Da expected), in addition to other peaks representing partial incorporation (1 U, 6623 Da observed, 6618 Da expected) or misincorporation (3 U's, 7235 Da observed, 7230 Da expected). Importantly, once the TFV-DP was incorporated, there was no further extension, indicating it was a permanent terminator.In summary, these results demonstrate that the nucleotide analogues 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP, 3'-N 3 -dTTP, and TFV-DP are permanent terminators for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Their prodrug versions (Sofosbuvir, 3'-F-5'-O-phosphoramidate dT nucleoside, 3'-N 3 -5'-O-phosphoramidate dT nucleoside, and TAF) are available or can be readily synthesized using the ProTide prodrug approach, 18 as shown in Fig. 1 a-d, and can be developed as therapeutics for COVID-19.

The sequences of the primer and template used for these extension reactions, which are at the 3' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, are shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating (a) 2'-F,Me-UTP, (b) 3'-F-dTTP, (c) UTP + TFV-DP, and (d) 3'-N 3 -dTTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.SARS-CoV-2 nsp12: The SARS-CoV-2 sp12 gene was codon optimized and cloned into pFastBac with Cterminal additions of a TEV site and strep tag (Genscript).

The bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells (Expression Systems) with Cellfectin II (Life Technologies) to generate recombinant baculovirus.

Rosetta2 pLys E. coli cells (Novagen) were used for bacterial expression. After induction with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), cultures were grown at 16°C for 16 hrs.

Oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT, Inc. The primer and template (sequences shown in Fig. 2) were annealed by heating to 70°C for 10 min and cooling to room temperature in 1x reaction buffer.

38d6gb7o,A SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interaction Map Reveals Drug Targets and Potential Drug-Repurposing,"modalities 15 . Unfortunately, our minimal knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection precludes a comprehensive evaluation of small molecule candidates for host-directed therapies. We sought to address this knowledge gap by systematically mapping the interaction landscape between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins.Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates suggests that the 30kb genome encodes as many as 14 open reading frames (Orfs). The 5' Orf1a / Orf1ab encodes polyproteins, which are auto-proteolytically processed into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) which form the replicase / transcriptase complex (RTC). The RTC consists of multiple enzymes, including the papain-like protease (Nsp3), the main protease (Nsp5), the Nsp7-Nsp8 primase complex, the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), a helicase/triphosphatase (Nsp13), an exoribonuclease (Nsp14), an endonuclease (Nsp15), and N7-and 2'O-methyltransferases (Nsp10/Nsp16) 1, 16, 17 . At the 3' end of the viral genome, as many as 13 Orfs are expressed from nine predicted sub-genomic RNAs. These include four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) 17 , and nine putative accessory factors ( Fig. 1a) 1, 16 . In genetic composition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is very similar to SARS-CoV: each has an Orf1ab encoding 16 predicted Nsps and each has the four typical coronavirus structural proteins. However, they differ in their complement of 3' open reading frames: SARS-CoV-2 possesses an Orf3b and Orf10 with limited detectable protein homology to SARS-CoV 16 , and its Orf8 is intact while SARS-CoV encodes Orf8a and Orf8b (Fig. 1b) 1, 16, 18 .Mature Nsps and all predicted proteins expressed from other SARS-CoV-2 Orfs (27 proteins plus one mutant) were codon optimized and cloned into a mammalian expression vector with a 2xStrep tag fused to either the Nor C-terminus 19 . Protein expression plasmids were transfected into human HEK293T cells, which were incubated for 40 hours before lysis in a mild detergent buffer. Viral proteins were affinity purified using MagStrep beads. Beads were washed, on-bead digestion was performed overnight, and peptides were desalted and analyzed by protein mass spectrometry. High confidence interactors were identified using SAINTexpress and the MiST algorithm 19, 20 .To verify viral protein expression, we performed an anti-Strep western blot on input cell lysate, and with the exception of Nsp4, Nsp6, Nsp11, and Orf3b, we observed bands consistent with predicted protein sizes (24 of 28 constructs). Despite the lack of detection via western blot we were able to detect expression of viral peptides Nsp4, Nsp6, and Orf3b in the proteomic analysis. The fourth construct not confirmed by western blot, the small peptide Nsp11, had a predicted molecular mass of 4.8 kDa (including tag) but an apparent mass of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 1c) . SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b has limited homology to SARS-CoV Orf3b 16 , and its restricted expression as measured by both western blot and AP-MS may indicate that it is either not a bonafide protein coding gene or that it requires co-expression of other SARS-CoV-2 proteins for robust expression. Ultimately we proceeded with analysis of protein interaction data from 27 baits, and excluded Orf7b, which had high prey detection background (Fig. 1d) .Our affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis identified 332 protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 1, 2 ; also see Fig. 3 ). We studied the interacting human proteins in regards to their cell biology, anatomical expression patterns, expression changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection 21 and in relation to other maps of pathogen interacting proteins 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] (Fig.  2a) . For each of the viral proteins, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (Fig. 2b , Extended Data Fig. 2) , identifying the major cell biological processes of the interacting proteins, including lipoprotein metabolism . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a (S), nuclear transport (Nsp7), and biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein (Nsp8). To discover potential binding interfaces, we performed an enrichment for domain families within the interacting proteins of each viral bait (Extended Data Fig. 3) . As examples, we note the enrichment of DNA polymerase domains in the interactors of Nsp1 and the enrichment of bromodomains and extra-terminal domain (BET) family for interactors of E (see also Figs. 3, 4) . In line with the latter, the interactors of E are also enriched in genes annotated for binding to acetylated histones (Fig. 2b) .While the cells used for these AP-MS experiments, HEK-293T kidney cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection 31 , they do not represent the primary physiological site of infection. Therefore, we asked whether the host proteins bound by SARS-CoV-2 might be specifically relevant to the virus's typical environment, lung tissue. We tested if the interacting human proteins were preferentially highly expressed, at the protein level, in any of 29 human tissues 32 , which identified the lung as the tissue with the highest expression of the prey proteins relative to the average proteome (Fig. 2c) . In accordance to this, when compared to overall RefSeq gene expression in the lung (median=3.198 TPM), the interacting proteins were more highly expressed (median=25.52 TPM, p=0.0007; t-test, Extended Data Fig. 4 ) and were also specifically enriched in lung expression relative to other tissues (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). These data support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially hijacks proteins available in lung tissue and the degree of tissue specific expression may facilitate the drug targeting of host factors with fewer systemic side-effects; this observation is particularly compelling given its derivation from HEK293 cells, which are themselves not lung derived. To further study the relevance of our map, we analyzed the recently reported protein abundance changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection 33 . We calculated, when possible, the correlation between changes in abundance of viral proteins and their human interaction partners across the 4 timepoints reported. Interacting pairs tended to have stronger correlated changes than other pairs of viralhuman proteins (Fig. 2d , KS test p-value=4.8e−05), arguing that the AP-MS derived interactions are of high relevance for the target tissue and the infection context. We compared our SARS-CoV-2 interaction map with those derived for 10 other pathogens (Fig. 2e) , identifying West Nile Virus (WNV) 23 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 27 as having the most similar host protein interaction partners. The association with Mtb is particularly interesting considering it also infects lung tissue.Finally, we studied the evolutionary properties of the host proteins. Successful virus spread in a diverse population in theory could be facilitated by a reliance on conserved host molecular components, therefore we analyzed the conservation of the human proteins identified in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Relative to a control sample of genes, the 332 SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins had depleted missense and premature stop mutations in gnomAD 34 , indicating that they have reduced genetic variation in human populations (Extended Data Fig. 6 ).Our study highlighted interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins with a range of functions including DNA replication (Nsp1), epigenetic and gene expression regulators (Nsp5, Nsp8, Nsp13, E), vesicle trafficking (Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp15, Orf3a, E, M, Orf8), lipid modification (Spike), RNA processing and regulation (Nsp8, N), ubiquitin ligases (Orf10), signaling (Nsp8, Nsp13, N, Orf9b), nuclear transport machinery (Nsp9, Nsp15, Orf6), cytoskeleton (Nsp1, Nsp13), mitochondria (Nsp4, Nsp8, Orf9c), and extracellular matrix (Nsp9) (Fig. 3) .A prominent number of interactions were related to lipid modifications and vesicle trafficking. Interestingly, the Spike protein (S) interacts with the GOLGA7-ZDHHC5 acyl-transferase complex, which likely mediates palmitoylation on its cytosolic tail (see also Appendix) 35 . Palmitoylation has been reported to facilitate membrane fusion by SARS-CoV Spike and suggests a potential target for therapeutic inhibition 36 . Interestingly, ZDHHC5 also has a published role in allowing anthrax toxin to enter cells, suggesting that inhibition of this enzyme could have broad utility 37 . Host interactions of Nsp8 (signal recognition particle), Orf8 (endoplasmic reticulum quality control), M (ER structural morphology proteins), Nsp13 (golgins) may facilitate the dramatic reconfiguration of ER/Golgi trafficking during coronavirus infection, and interactions in peripheral compartments by Nsp6 and M (vacuolar ATPase), Nsp7 (Rabs), Nsp10 (AP2), E (AP3), and Orf3a (HOPS) may also modify endomembrane compartments to favor coronavirus replication.We identified protein-protein interactions with the main protease Nsp5, using both wild-type and catalytic dead (C145A) constructs. For wild-type Nsp5, we identified one high-confidence interaction, the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and predicted a cleavage site between the HDAC domain and the nuclear localization sequence, suggesting that Nsp5 may inhibit HDAC2 transport into the nucleus (Extended Data Fig.  7) , potentially impacting the published functions of HDAC2 in mediating inflammation and interferon response 38, 39 . We also identified an interaction of Nsp5 (C145A) with tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), which is responsible for synthesis of the dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) base modification on both nuclear and mitochondrial tRNAs 40 . We predict TRMT1 is also cleaved by Nsp5, removing its zinc finger and nuclear localization signal and likely resulting in an exclusively mitochondrial localization (Extended Data Fig. 7 ).We identified a number of cellular proteins implicated in innate immune signaling that are targeted by several SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Interestingly, we found that Nsp13 interacts with two key players of IFN signaling pathway including TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and TANK-binding kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1/SINTBAD). SINTBAD acts as a critical adaptor protein between TBK1 and IKKi and therefore mediates induction of IRF-dependent transcription 41 . Further, Nsp13 interacts with multiple proteins of the TLE family, which are known to modulate NF-κB inflammatory response [42] [43] [44] . RNF41/Nrdp1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase is targeted by Nsp15 protein which promotes activation of TBK1 and IRF3 and therefore increases type I interferon production 45 . Two other E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM59 and MIB1 regulate antiviral innate immune signaling and are usurped by Orf3a and Nsp9, respectively 46,47 . Orf9c protein was found to interact with multiple proteins that modulate IkB kinase and NF-kB signaling pathway including NLRX1, F2RL1, NDFIP2 48-50 . We also found that Orf9b interacts with a mitochondrial import receptor, Tom70, which acts as an essential adaptor linking MAVS to TBK1/IRF3, resulting in the activation of IRF-3 51 .N targets stress granule protein G3BP1, an essential antiviral protein which is known to induce innate immune response through multiple mechanisms 52-54 . Common among coronaviridae is the manipulation of stress granules (SG) and related RNA biology, possibly leading to suppression of stress granules and host translation shutoff 55 . This functionality seems to benefit viral replication, as stress granules are inhibitory to replication of MERS-CoV 56 and other viruses 57 . The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) interactome includes many host mRNA binding proteins, including the SG related factors G3BP1/2, the mTOR translational repressors LARP1, and the protein kinases CK2 (Fig. 4a ). SGs are induced by protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α upon viral dsRNA recognition 57 . Promoting G3BP aggregation via the eIF4A inhibitor Zotatafin 58,59 or reducing SG disassembly by Silmitasertib inhibition of CK2 60 warrant investigation for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin disrupts the binding of LARP1 to mTORC1 61 and has been shown to reduce MERS infection by ~60% in vitro 62 , another drug that could be tested for repurposing.Orf6 of SARS-CoV has been shown to play a role in antagonizing host interferon signaling 63 ; we identified a novel, high-confidence interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 and NUP98-RAE1, an interferon-inducible mRNA nuclear export complex 64 that is hijacked or degraded by multiple viruses, including VSV, Influenza-A, KSHV, and Polio, and is a restriction factor for Influenza-A infection 58, 60, 62, 65 . The X-ray structure of VSV M protein complexed with NUP98-RAE1 66 reveals key binding interactions that include a buried methionine residue on the M-protein packing into a hydrophobic pocket in RAE1, as well as neighboring acidic residues interacting with a basic patch on the NUP98-RAE1 complex (Fig 4b) . These binding features are also present in a conserved motif in the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8 ), providing a structural hypothesis for the observed SARS-CoV-2-NUP98-RAE1 interaction. Moreover, a peptide containing the binding region of the VSV M protein was previously shown to outcompete RNA binding to NUP98-RAE1, suggesting a role in interfering with mRNA export 66 . These observations suggest a viral strategy to target the RNA nuclear export activity of RAE1, potentially revealing a mode of interferon antagonism by SARS-CoV-2.Viruses commonly hijack ubiquitination pathways for replication and pathogenesis 67 . The novel Orf10 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple members of a Cullin 2 (CUL2) RING E3 ligase complex (Fig. 4c) , specifically the CUL2 ZYG11B complex. ZYG11B, a substrate adapter of CUL2 that targets substrates with exposed N-terminal glycines for degradation 65 , is the highest scoring protein in the Orf10 interactome suggesting its direct interaction with Orf10. Orf10 may bind to the CUL2 ZYG11B complex and hijack it for ubiquitination and degradation of restriction factors. The ubiquitin transfer to a substrate requires neddylation of CUL2 via NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), a druggable target that can be inhibited by the small molecule Pevonedistat 68 (Fig. 4c) .Surprisingly, we find that the transmembrane protein E binds to the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2 and BRD4 (Fig. 4d , Extended Data Fig. 9 ), potentially disrupting BRD-histone binding by mimicking histone structure. BRD2 is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) domain family whose members bind acetylated histones to regulate gene transcription 69 . The N-terminus of histone 2A shares local sequence similarity over an alpha-helix of approximately 15 residues, some of which are in a transmembrane segment, of Protein E (Fig.  4d) . Moreover, this matching region of the histone is spanned by acetylated lysine residues shown to bind BRD2 70 . This analysis may suggest that Protein E mimics the histone to disrupt its interaction with BRD2, thus inducing changes in host's protein expression that are beneficial to the virus. For a more comprehensive overview of the virus-host interactions we detected, see Supplemental Discussion.To identify small molecules targeting human proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome, we sought ligands known to interact with the human proteins, often directly but also by pathway and complexes, drawing on chemoinformatics databases and analyses (Methods). Molecules were prioritized by the statistical significance of the interaction between the human and viral proteins; by their status as approved drugs, investigational new drugs (INDs, ""clinical"" in Table 1a ,b), or as preclinical candidates; by their apparent selectivity; and by their availability (for purchase availability notes, see Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 ). Chemoinformatics searches yielded 15 approved drugs, four investigational new drugs (clinical), and 18 pre-clinical candidates (Table 1a) , while specialist knowledge revealed 12 approved drugs, 10 investigational new drugs (clinical), and 10 preclinical candidates (Table 1b) . Of the 332 human targets that interact with the viral bait proteins with high significance, 63 have drugs/INDs/preclinical molecules that modulate them (Fig. 3 ). If we reduce our protein interaction score threshold slightly, we find an additional four human targets, revealing a total of 67 human targets (Supplementary  Tables 3 and 4 ). The drug-human protein associations may be overlaid on top of our protein interaction network, highlighting potentially druggable host interactions (Fig. 5a ).There are several mechanistically interesting, and potentially disease-relevant drug-target interactions revealed in the chemoinformatic network (Fig. 5a ). Among them, the well-known chemical probe, Bafilomycin A1, is a potent inhibitor of the V1-ATPase, subunits of which interact with Nsp6 and M. Bafilomycin's inhibition of this cotransporter acts to prevent the acidification of the lysosome, inhibiting autophagy and endosome trafficking pathways, which may impact the viral life-cycle. Similarly, drugs exist to target several well-known epigenetic regulators prominent among the human interactors, including HDAC2, BRD2 and BRD4, which interact with viral proteins nsp5 and E, respectively (Figs. 3 and 5a). The approved drug Valproic acid (an anticonvulsant) and the . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Clinical compounds ABBV-744 and CPI-0610 act on BRD2/4, with an affinity of 2 nM or 39 nM, respectively --several preclinical compounds also target bromodomain-containing proteins (Table 1a,b). As a final example, we were intrigued to observe that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein interacts with the Sigma receptor, which is thought to regulate ER stress response 71 . Similarly, the Sigma2 receptor interacted with the vial protein orf9. Both Sigma1 and Sigma2 are promiscuous receptors that interact with many non-polar, cationic drugs. We prioritized several of these drugs based on potency or potential disease relevance, including the antipsychotic Haloperidol, which binds in the low nM range to both receptors 72 , and Chloroquine, which is currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 and has mid-nM activity vs the Sigma1 receptor, and low μM activity against the Sigma2 receptor. Because many patients are already treated with drugs that have off-target impact on Sigma receptors, associating clinical outcomes accompanying treatment with these drugs may merit investigation, a point to which we return. Finally, in addition to the druggable host factors, a few of which we have highlighted here, the SARS-CoV-2-human interactome reveals many traditionally ""undruggable"" targets. Among these, for instance, are components of the centriole such as CEP250, which interacts with the viral Nsp13. Intriguingly, a very recent patent disclosure revealed a natural product, WDB002, that directly and specifically targets CEP250. As a natural product, WDB002 would likely be harder to source than the molecules on which we have focused on here, but may well merit investigation. Similarly, other ""undruggable"" targets may be revealed to have compounds that could usefully perturb the viral-human interaction network, and act as leads to therapeutics.Beyond direct interactions, several drug-pathway interactions seemed noteworthy. The human purine biosynthesis enzyme Inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH2) interacts with the viral protein nsp14. Several chemically diverse compounds inhibit IMPDH2, including the clinically approved mycophenolic acid (20 nM), the approved antiviral drug ribavirin (200 nM), and the investigational new drug Merimepodib (10 nM) (Table  1a) . Intriguingly, the preclinical molecule Sanglifehrin A (Table 1b) is known to act as a molecular glue linking IMPDH with cyclophilin A (Fig. 5b) 73 , which itself is implicated in viral capsid packaging, even though it itself is not a human ""prey"" in the viral-human protein interactome. Similarly, direct viral-human interactions with proteins regulated by the mTORC1 pathway, such as LARP1, and FKBP7, which interact with the viral N and Orf8 proteins, led us to inhibitors of mTORC1, even though that kinase itself is not found to directly interact with a viral protein (Fig. 5c ). Sapanisertib and rapamycin are low nM inhibitors of mTORC1, while metformin is an indirect modulator of this protein complex.We have used affinity purification-mass spectrometry to identify 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2human PPIs. We find the viral proteins connected to a wide array of biological processes, including protein trafficking, translation, transcription and ubiquitination regulation. Using a combination of a systematic chemoinformatic drug search with a pathway centric analysis, we uncovered close to 70 different drugs and compounds, including FDA approved drugs, compounds in clinical trials as well as preclinical compounds, targeting parts of the resulting network. We are currently testing these compounds for antiviral activity and encourage others to do the same as well as extract insights from the map that could have therapeutic value.More generally, this proteomic/chemoinformatic analysis is not only identifying drug and clinical molecules that might perturb the viral-human interactome, it gives these potentially therapeutic perturbations a mechanistic context. Among those that may be infection relevant are the inhibition of lysosomal acidification and trafficking with Bafilomycin A1, via inhibition of V-ATPase 74 , and modulation of the ER stress and the protein unfolding response pathway by targeting the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptor by drugs like haloperidol (Fig. 5a , Tables 1a,b). Indeed, several of the human proteins in the interactome are targeted by drugs that have emerged phenotypically as candidate therapeutics for treating COVID-19, such as chloroquine 75, 76 . While we do not . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Similarly, antibiotics like azithromycin have also been mooted as treatments for COVID-19. While this too remains to be demonstrated, we note that Azithromycin has off-target activity against human mitochondrial ribosomes, components of which interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein (MRPS5, MRPS27, MRPS2, and MRPS25). Other antibiotics that also have an off-target effect on mitochondrial ribosomes, such as chloramphenicol, tigecycline, and Linezolid 77,78 may also merit study for efficacy. Indeed, this logic may be extended. Many COVID-19 patients will be on the drugs identified here, treating pre-existing conditions. It may be useful to correlate clinical outcomes with the taking of these drugs, cross-referencing with the networks described here. In some senses, this is already occurring phenomenologically, leading to concerns about ACE inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril, and for NSAIDs. What this study provides is a systematic schema for clinical/drug associations going forward, giving them a mechanistic context that allows investigators to seek them directly.Systematic validation using genetic-based approaches 79,80 will be key to determine the functional relevance of these interactions and if the human proteins are being used by the virus or are fighting off infection, information that would inform future pharmacological studies. It is important to note that pharmacological intervention with the agents we identified in this study could be either detrimental or beneficial for infection. For instance, the HDAC2 inhibitors may compound the potential action of the Nsp5 protease to hydrolyze this human protein. Future work will involve generation of protein-protein interaction maps in different human cell types, as well as bat cells, and the study of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the less virulent OC43 5 , data that will allow for valuable cross-species and viral evolution studies. Targeted biochemical and structural studies will also be crucial for a deeper understanding of the viral-host complexes, which will inform more targeted drug design.Along with SARS-CoV-2, we have previously utilized global affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis to map the host-pathogen interfaces of a number of human pathogens including Ebola 22 , Dengue 30 , Zika 30 , Herpesvirus 29 , Hepatitis C 28 , Tuberculosis 27 , Chlamydia 26 , Enteroviruses 25 , HIV 19 , HPV 24 , and West Nile Fever 23 . Excitingly, we have uncovered both shared and unique mechanisms in which these pathogens co-opt the host machinery during the course of infection. Although host-directed therapy is often not explored for combatting pathogenic infections, it would be interesting to use this information to identify host factors that could serve as targets that would harbor pan-pathogenic activity so that when the next virus undergoes zoonosis, we will have treatment options available.Supplementary Information is available for this paper.Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to nevan.krogan@ucsf.edu Reprints and permissions information is available at www.nature.com/reprintsThe authors have not filed for patent protection on the SARS-CoV-2 host interactions or the use of predicted drugs for treating COVID-19 to ensure all the information is freely available to accelerate the discovery of a treatment.

It is a target for proliferative diseases including cancer 81 and autoimmune disorders, for instance by the approved drug mycophenolic acid 82 , and as a broad spectrum antiviral by Ribavirin 83 . While Ribavirin has activity against SARS in vitro 84 , it has low tolerability, something that might be addressed by the more selective Merimepodib, which is in phase II clinical trials 85 .

In addition to Rapamycin, the mTOR pathway can be indirectly modulated by metformin, a widely prescribed diabetes drug, and by Sapanisertib, a drug in clinical trials for solid tumors 61 .Transfection. For each affinity purification, ten million HEK293T cells were plated per 15-cm dish and transfected with up to 15 μg of individual Strep-tagged expression constructs after 20-24 hours. Total plasmid was normalized to 15 μg with empty vector and complexed with PolyJet Transfection Reagent (SignaGen Laboratories) at a 1:3 μg:μl ratio of plasmid to transfection reagent based on manufacturer's recommendations. After more than 38 hours, cells were dissociated at room temperature using 10 ml Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline without calcium and magnesium (D-PBS) supplemented with 10 mM EDTA for at least 5 minutes and subsequently washed with 10 ml D-PBS. Each step was followed by centrifugation at 200 xg, 4°C for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C. At least three biological replicates were independently prepared for affinity purification.Affinity purification. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice for 15-20 minutes and suspended in 1 ml Lysis Buffer [IP Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4°C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P 40 Substitute (NP40; Fluka Analytical) and cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche)]. Samples were then frozen on dry ice for 10-20 minutes and partially thawed at 37°C before incubation on a tube rotator for 30 minutes at 4°C and centrifugation at 13,000 xg, 4°C for 15 minutes to pellet debris. After reserving 50 μl lysate, up to 48 samples were arrayed into a 96-well Deepwell plate for affinity purification on the KingFisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Scientific) as follows: MagStrep ""type3"" beads (30 μl; IBA Lifesciences) were equilibrated twice with 1 ml Wash Buffer (IP Buffer supplemented with 0.05% NP40) and incubated with 0.95 ml lysate for 2 hours. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml Wash Buffer and then once with 1 ml IP Buffer. To directly digest bead-bound proteins as well as elute proteins with biotin, beads were manually suspended in IP Buffer and divided in half before transferring to 50 μl Denaturation-Reduction Buffer (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT) and 50 μl 1x Buffer BXT (IBA Lifesciences) dispensed into a single 96-well KF microtiter plate, respectively. Purified proteins were first eluted at room temperature for 30 minutes with constant shaking at 1,100 rpm on a ThermoMixer C incubator. After removing eluates, on-bead digestion proceeded (below). Strep-tagged protein expression in lysates and enrichment in eluates were assessed by western blot and silver stain, respectively. The KingFisher Flex Purification System was placed in the cold room and allowed to equilibrate to 4°C overnight before use. All automated protocol steps were performed using the slow mix speed and the following mix times: 30 seconds for equilibration/wash steps, 2 hours for binding, and 1 minute for final bead release. Three 10 second bead collection times were used between all steps.On-bead digestion. Bead-bound proteins were denatured and reduced at 37°C for 30 minutes and after bringing to room temperature, alkylated in the dark with 3 mM iodoacetamide for 45 minutes and quenched with 3 mM DTT for 10 minutes. Proteins were then incubated at 37°C, initially for 4 hours with 1.5 μl trypsin (0.5 μg/μl; Promega) and then another 1-2 hours with 0.5 μl additional trypsin. To offset evaporation, 15 μl 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 were added before trypsin digestion. All steps were performed with constant shaking at 1,100 rpm on a ThermoMixer C incubator. Resulting peptides were combined with 50 μl 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 used to rinse beads and acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (0.5% final, pH < 2.0). Acidified peptides were desalted for MS analysis using a BioPureSPE Mini 96-Well Plate (20mg PROTO 300 C18; The Nest Group, Inc.) according to standard protocols.Mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis. Samples were re-suspended in 4% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile solution, and separated by a reversed-phase gradient over a nanoflow C18 column (Dr. Maisch). Each sample was analyzed on two different mass spectrometers. First, a 75 min acquisition, in which peptides were directly injected via a Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo) into a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo), with all MS1 and MS2 spectra collected in the orbitrap. For all acquisitions, QCloud was used to control instrument longitudinal performance during the project 94 . All proteomic data was searched against the human proteome (uniprot reviewed sequences downloaded February 28th, 2020), EGFP sequence, and the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences using the default settings for MaxQuant 95, 96 . Detected peptides and proteins were filtered to 1% false discovery rate in MaxQuant, and identified proteins were then subjected to protein-protein interaction scoring .

We applied a two step filtering strategy to determine the final list of reported interactors which relied on two different scoring stringency cutoffs. In the first step, we chose all protein interactions that possess a MiST score ≥ 0.7, a SAINTexpress BFDR ≤ 0.05 and an average spectral count ≥ 2.For all proteins that fulfilled these criteria we extracted information about stable protein complexes they participate in from the CORUM 98 database of known protein complexes. In the second step we then relaxed the stringency and recovered additional interactors that (1) form complexes with interactors determined in filtering step 1 and (2) fulfill the following criteria: MiST score ≥ 0.6, SAINTexpress BFDR ≤ 0.05 and average spectral counts ≥ 2. Proteins that fulfilled filtering criteria in either step 1 or step 2 were considered to be HC-PPIs and visualized with cytoscape 99 . Using this filtering criteria, nearly all of our baits recovered a number of HC-PPIs in close alignment with previous datasets reporting an average of ~6 PPIs per bait 100 . However, for a subset of baits (Orf8, Nsp8, Nsp13, and orf9c) we observed a much higher number of PPIs passing these filtering criteria. For these four baits, the MiST scoring was instead performed using an larger in-house database of 87 baits that were prepared and processed in an analogous manner to this SARS-CoV-2 dataset. This was done to provide a more comprehensive collection of baits for comparison, to minimize the classification of non-specifically binding background proteins as HC-PPIs. All mass spectrometry raw data and search results files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD018117 101, 102 . PPI networks have also been uploaded to NDEx.Gene Ontology Over-representation Analysis. The targets of each bait were tested for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO Biological Process) terms. The over-representation analysis (ORA) was performed using the enricher function of clusterProfiler package in R with default parameters. The gene ontology terms were obtained from the c5 category of Molecular Signature Database (MSigDBv6.1). Significant GO terms (1% FDR) were identified and further refined to select non-redundant terms. In order to select non-redundant gene sets, we first constructed a GO term tree based on distances (1-Jaccard Similarity Coefficients of shared genes) between the significant terms. The GO term tree was cut at a specific level (h=0.99) to identify clusters of non-redundant gene sets. For a bait with multiple significant terms belonging to the same cluster, we selected the broadest term i.e. largest gene set size.Virus Interactome Similarity Analysis. Interactome similarity was assessed by comparing the number of shared human interacting proteins between pathogen pairs, using a hypergeometric test to calculate significance. The background gene set for the test consisted of all unique proteins detected by mass spectrometry across all pathogens (N=10,181 genes).Orf6 peptide modeling. The proposed interaction between Orf6 and the NUP98-RAE1 complex was modeled in PyRosetta 4 103 (release v2020.02-dev61090) using the crystal structure of Vesicular stomatitis virus matrix (M) protein bound to NUP98-RAE1 as a template 66 (PDB 4OWR downloaded from the PDB-REDO server 104 ). The M protein chain (C) was truncated after residue 54 to restrict the model to the putative interaction motif in Orf6 (M protein residues 49-54, sequence DEMDTH). These residues were mutated to the Orf6 sequence, QPMEID, using the mutate_residue function in the module pyrosetta.toolbox, without repacking at this initial step. After all six residues were mutated, the full model was relaxed to a low energy conformation using the FastRelax protocol in the module pyrosetta.rosetta.protocols.relax. FastRelax was run with constraints to starting coordinates and scored with the ref2015 score function. The resulting model was inspected for any large energetic penalties associated with the modeled peptide residues or those NUP98 and RAE1 residues interacting with the peptide, and was found to have none. and 6r7n). The ZYG11B model has two structured domains: a leucine rich repeat (LRR) and Armadillo Repeat (ARM) at the N and C-terminus respectively. The linker between each domain was not modelled due to high flexibility between residues 32 to 49 and residues 304 to 322. Putative protein interaction surfaces on ZYG11B were modelled based on contiguous surface exposed residues that are conserved in ZYG11B orthologues from C. elegans to H. sapiens (ZY11B_HUMAN; ZY11B_MOUSE; F1M8P2_RAT; ZYG11_XENLA; ZYG11_DANRE; ZYG11_CAEEL) and located at typical substrate binding sites in the homologous structures of LRR and ARM domain co-complexes.In order to align protein E and histone H2A, the structure of the protein E SARS-CoV homolog (PDB ID: 2MM4) was compared to the human nucleosome structure (PDB ID: 6K1K). Protein E was structurally aligned to the histone subunits using Pymol's ""align"" function (https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Align). Align performs a sequence alignment followed by a structural superposition, and then carries out zero or more cycles of refinement in order to reject structural outliers found during the fit. The best superposition was obtained for H2A residues 49-60 & 63-70 and Protein E residues 25-44 at an RMSD of 2.8Å, as reported in Figure 4d .To identify drugs and reagents that modulate the 332 host factors interacting with SARS-CoV-2-HEK293T (MiST >= 0.70), we used two approaches: 1) a chemoinformatic analysis of open-source chemical databases and 2) a target-and pathwayspecific literature search, drawing on specialist knowledge within our group. Chemoinformatically, we retrieved 2,472 molecules from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (2020-3-12) that interacted with 30 human ""prey"" proteins (38 approved, 71 in clinical trials), and found 10,883 molecules (95 approved, 369 in clinical trials) from the ChEMBL25 database 107 (Supplementary Tables 5, 6 ). For both approaches, molecules were prioritized on their FDA approval status, activity at the target of interest better than 1 μM, and commercial availability, drawing on the ZINC database 108 . FDA approved molecules were prioritized except when clinical candidates or preclinical research molecules had substantially better selectivity or potency on-target. In some cases, we considered molecules with indirect mechanisms of action on the general pathway of interest based solely on literature evidence (e.g., captopril modulates ACE2 indirectly via its direct interaction with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, ACE). Finally, we predicted 6 additional molecules (2 approved, 1 in clinical trials) for proteins with MIST scores between 0.7-0.6 to viral baits (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 ). Complete methods can be found here (www.github.com/momeara/BioChemPantry/vignette/COVID19). a. These molecules derive from expert analysis of human protein interactors of SARS-Co-V2 and reagents and drugs that modulate them; not readily available from the chemoinformatically-searchable literature.

8gncbgot,"Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review","Since mid-December 2019 and as of early February 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) has infected over 25,000 laboratory-confirmed cases across 28 countries with about 500 deaths (a case-fatality rate of about 2%). More than 90% of the cases and deaths were in China [1] . Based on the initial reported surge of cases in Wuhan, the majority were males with a median age of 55 years and linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [2] . Most of the reported cases had similar symptoms at the onset of illness such as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. Most cases developed pneumonia and some severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [3] .The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a betacoronavirus, forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily [4] . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively [5, 6] . Based on current evidence, pathogenicity for 2019-nCoV is about 3%, which is significantly lower than SARS-CoV (10%) and MERS-CoV (40%) [7] . However, 2019-nCoV has potentially higher transmissibility (R0: 1.4-5.5) than both SARS-CoV (R0: [2] [3] [4] [5] and MERS-CoV (R0: <1) [7] .With the possible expansion of 2019-nCoV globally [8] and the declaration of the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics to detect, prevent and contain 2019-nCoV promptly. There is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-nCoV outbreak. The systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-nCoV, based in part on the developments for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.There were two independent reviewers each focusing on SARS, MERS, and 2019-nCoV, respectively. A third independent reviewer was engaged to resolve any conflicting article of interest. We used the key words ""SARS"", ""coronavirus"", ""MERS"", ""2019 Novel coronavirus"", ""Wuhan virus"" to identify the diseases in the search strategy. The systematic searches for diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines were carried out independently and the key words ""drug"", ""therapy"", ""vaccine"", ""diagnosis"", ""point of care testing"" and ""rapid diagnostic test"" were used in conjunction with the disease key words for the respective searches.Examples of search strings can be found in Table S1 . We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and validation trials (for diagnostics test) published in English, that measured (a) the sensitivity and/or specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit, (b) the impact of drug therapy or (c) vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases with no date restriction applied. For the 2019-nCoV, we searched for all in vitro, animal, or human studies published in English between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020, on the same outcomes of interest. In addition, we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial searches. Studies that examined the mechanisms of diagnostic tests, drug therapy or vaccine efficacy against SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV were excluded. A Google search for 2019-nCoV diagnostics (as of 6 February 2020; Table S2 ) yielded five webpage links from government and international bodies with official information and guidelines (WHO, Europe CDC, US CDC, US FDA), three webpage links on diagnostic protocols and scientific commentaries, and five webpage links on market news and press releases. Six protocols for diagnostics using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from six countries were published on WHO's website [9] . Google search for 2019-nCoV vaccines yielded 19 relevant articles.With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, real time RT-PCR remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain among the many diagnostic platforms available ( [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ; Table S3 ). Among the 16 diagnostics studies selected, one study discussed the use of RT-PCR in diagnosing patients with 2019-nCoV [11] ( Table 1 ). The period and type of specimen collected for RT-PCR play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. It was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period. It has also suggested that in the early days of illness, patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms.Apart from the commonly used RT-PCR in diagnosing MERS-CoV, four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), RT-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) and a one-step rRT-PCR assay based on specific TaqMan probes. RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity as real time RT-PCR. It is also highly specific and is used to detect MERS-CoV. It is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid, simple and convenient. Likewise, RT-iiPCR and a one-step rRT-PCR assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for MER-CoV. Lastly, one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real RT-PCR kits, with high accuracy. Although real time RT-PCR is a primary method for diagnosing MERS-CoV, high levels of PCR inhibition may hinder PCR sensitivity (Table 1) .There are eleven studies that focus on SARS-CoV diagnostic testing (Table 1) . These papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis. Comparison between the molecular test (i.e RT-PCR) and serological test (i.e., ELISA) showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity. Hence, enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis. Studies looked at using nested PCR to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating N gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity (Table 1 ).In addition, there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits (as of 24 January 2020; Table 2 ) available on the market for 2019-nCoV. Six of these are only for research purposes. Only one kit from Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis. Most of the kits are for RT-PCR. There were two kits (BGI, China and Veredus, Singapore) with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies, respectively. The limit of detection of the enhanced realtime PCR method was 10 2 -fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 10 7fold higher than conventional PCR methods In the clinical aspect, the enhanced realtime PCR method was able to detect 6 cases of SARS-CoV positive samples that were not confirmed by any other assay [25] • The real time PCR has a threshold sensitivity of 10 genome equivalents per reaction and it has a good reproducibility with the inter-assay coefficients of variation of 1.73 to 2.72%. • 13 specimens from 6 patients were positive with viral load range from 362 to 36,240,000 genome equivalents/mL. The real-time RT-PCR reaction was more sensitive than the nested PCR reaction, as the detection limit for the nested PCR reaction was about 10 3 genome equivalents in the standard cDNA control. [34] Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); open reading frame 1a (ORF1a); Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); immunofluorescent assay (IFA); immunochromatographic test (ICT); nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA). With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally (Table 3 ), in which a wide range of technology (such as messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle) was applied. It will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). However, the kit developed by the BGI have passed emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of China [40] .Of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-nCoV, SARS CoV or MERS-CoV vaccines screened, only four were eventually included in the review. Most studies on SARS and MERS vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models ( Figure 1 ). The four studies included in this review were Phase I clinical trials on SARS or MERS vaccines (Table 4 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . There were no studies of any population type (cell, animal, human) on the 2019-nCoV at the point of screening. The published clinical trials were mostly done in United States except for one on the SARS vaccine done in China [44] . All vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS were reported to be safe, well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. In addition, we highlight six ongoing Phase I clinical trials identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov register ( [48, 49] ); Table  S4 ) [50] [51] [52] . These trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective MERS-CoV vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet. The trials are projected to complete in December 2020 (two studies in Russia [50, 51] ) and December 2021 (in Germany [52] ).Existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-nCoV trials at the time of writing. Among 23 trials found from the systematic review (Table 5) , there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) for 2019-nCoV therapeutics [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional Chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment. The remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-nCoV patients (Table 5) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. T-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60.[47] Molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. The discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the SARS virus. Researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks.[85] Besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) selected from the systematic review (Table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at SARS therapeutics [92] . The studies found from ClinicalTrials.gov have not been updated since 2013. While many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only, there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage. Three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the SARS epidemic-3 in China, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Hong Kong [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . The studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants, combination of western and Chinese treatment vs. Chinese treatment in 123 participants, integrative Chinese and Western treatment in 49 patients, usage of a specific Chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants. Another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants [98] . One randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and Chinese treatment during the SARS epidemic was excluded as it was a Chinese article [94] .There is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at MERS therapeutics [99] . It investigates the usage of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta 1B. Likewise, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma usage. To date, only one trial has been completed. One phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) was found in available literature [46] . The trial conducted in the United States in 2017 demonstrated SAB-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses. Another trial on MERS therapeutics was found on ClinicalTrials.gov-a phase 2/3 trial in the United States evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity on coadministered MERS-CoV antibodies REGN3048 & REGN3051 [100].Rapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. Local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home. Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] .Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles.The key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase. The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses. The limitation of virus culture and isolation is the long duration and the highly specialized skills required of the technicians to process the samples. All patients recovered.Significantly shorted time from the disease onset to the symptom improvement in treatment (5.10 ± 2.83 days) compared to control group (7.62 ± 2.27 days) (p < 0.05) No significant difference in blood routine improvement, pulmonary chest shadow in chest film improvement and corticosteroid usgae between the 2 groups. However, particularly in the respect of improving clinical symptoms, elevating quality of life, promoting immune function recovery, promoting absorption of pulmonary inflammation, reducing the dosage of cortisteroid and shortening the therapeutic course, treatment with integrative chinese and western medicine treatment had obvious superiority compared with using control treatment alone. Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. [46] Where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral RNA because of the tropism of the virus. MERS-CoV viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases. Although upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs can be used, they have potentially lower viral loads and may have higher risk of false-negatives among the mild MERS and SARS cases [102, 103] , and likely among the 2019-nCoV cases.The existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include (a) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), (b) real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), (c) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and (d) real-time RT-LAMP [104] . Nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are usually preferred as in the case of MERS-CoV diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection [102] . Chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-nCoV in the GenBank and in GISAID portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus [11] . Several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, as highlighted in WHO's interim guidance on nCoV laboratory testing of suspected cases. These include protocols from other countries such as Thailand, Japan and China [105] .The first validated diagnostic test was designed in Germany. Corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on the SARS or SARS-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was SARS-like. Upon the release of the sequence, assays were selected based on the match against 2019-nCoV upon inspection of the sequence alignment. Two assays were used for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and E gene where E gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and RdRp gene assay as the confirmatory testing. All assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses [11] .The Hong Kong University used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus Sarbecovirus (consisting of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-like coronavirus). Viral RNA extracted from SARS-CoV can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that SARS has been eradicated. It is proposed that the N gene RT-PCR can be used as a screening assay while the Orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test. However, this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control SARS-CoV RNA. Synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-nCoV have yet to be tested [106] .The US CDC shared the protocol on the real time RT-PCR assay for the detection of the 2019-nCoV with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of SARS-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-nCoV. However, the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described. There are some limitations for the assay. Analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation. False negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection, transportation or handling. Also, RNA viruses may show substantial genetic variability. This could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results [107] . Point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations, which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few months.Serological testing such as ELISA, IIFT and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection, including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate. Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens. There would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset [108] . Furthermore, studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load. Hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not available or accessible [102] .Vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest, especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes. In the context of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak, vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection. This decreases the effective R0 value of the disease. Nonetheless, there are social, clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes, including (a) the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine, (b) the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination, (c) the potential difference and/or low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials' populations and (d) the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population (including the cost and availability of the vaccine).Vaccines against the 2019-nCoV are currently in development and none are in testing (at the time of writing). On 23 January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with Inovio, The University of Queensland and Moderna, Inc respectively, with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks (By June 2020). The vaccine candidates will be developed by the DNA, recombinant and mRNA vaccine platforms from these organizations [109] .Based on the most recent MERS-CoV outbreak, there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage. The vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccine, inactivated whole-virus (IWV) vaccine and live attenuated vaccine. The latest findings for these vaccines arebased on the review by Yong et al. (2019) in August 2019 [110] . As of the date of reporting, there is only one published clinical study on the MERS-CoV vaccine by GeneOne Life Science & Inovio Pharmaceuticals [47] . There was one SARS vaccine trial conducted by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Both Phase I clinical trials reported positive results, but only one has announced plans to proceed to Phase 2 trial [111] .Due to the close genetic relatedness of SARS-CoV (79%) with 2019-nCoV [112] , there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe SARS-CoV vaccine while awaiting the 2019-nCoV vaccine. However, this would require small scale phase-by-phase implementation and close monitoring of vaccinees before any large scale implementation.Apart from the timely diagnosis of cases, the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered. ACE2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-nCoV to infect humans as SARS-CoV [113] . Hence, clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected, particularly in severe cases. In addition, most of those who have died from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems [114] . Coronaviruses have error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP), which result in frequent mutations and recombination events. This results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk [115] . Since ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-nCoV, similarly to SAR-CoV.However, in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease [116, 117] . Well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce. No coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring SARS-CoV inhibitors. The bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase, with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle. Stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential. Effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections. Clinical trials have commenced in China to identify effective treatments for 2019-nCoV based on the treatment evidence from SARS and MERS. There is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence; any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical study/trial. Few treatments have shown real curative action against SARS and MERS and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case series.Many interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV both in vitro and in animal models. Interferon β has consistently been shown to be the most active, followed by interferon α. The use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 (synthetic interferon α) appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls. Interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [116, 117] . Interferons, with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in China for 2019-nCoV. This drug treatment appears to be the most advanced. Timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness. A combination of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection. Ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages. Hence, ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed. This was the most common agent reported in the available literature. Its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies, retrospective case series, retrospective cohort study, a prospective observational study, a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants [117] . Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of SARS-CoV. Its efficacy was documented in several studies, causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone. Combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial infection and death, amongst other favorable outcomes. Recent in vitro studies have shown another HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, to have antiviral capacity against SARS-CoV, although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies [118] . Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, GS-5734) nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support GS-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses (CoVs), including highly pathogenic CoVs and potentially emergent BatCoVs. The use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatment.Improved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) of viral etiology. A significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 0.25 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed [119] . Studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes, allocation of treatment based on the physician's discretion, and the availability of plasma. Factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results. Associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay, viral antibody levels, and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature. Convalescent plasma, while promising, is likely not yet feasible, given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability. Monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing. SARS-CoV enters host cells through the binding of their spike (S) protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L [118] . Human monoclonal antibodies to the S protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following MERS-CoV infection [120] . Such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively. While such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines, there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodies.Other therapeutic agents have also been reported. A known antimalarial agent, chloroquine, elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including HIV type 1, hepatitis B and HCoV-229E. Chloroquine is also immunomodulatory, capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6) [121] . It is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ACE2 glycosylation and endosomal pH. Its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of SARS. Niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment. The efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays. In both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays, niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis. Reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent. Niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells, nor does it function as a protease inhibitor. Mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation [122] . Glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication. Glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses. While preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide (which inhibits virus replication) through induction of nitrous oxide synthase, the mechanism of Glycyrrhizin against SARS-CoV remains unclear. The compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin [123] . Inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin [124] , extracted from another herb used in the treatment of SARS in China and Hong Kong. Findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies [121] [122] [123] [124] .Due to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-nCoV, there will be potential limitations to the systematic review. The systematic review is likely to have publication bias as some developments have yet to be reported while for other developments there is no intention to report publicly (or in scientific platforms) due to confidentiality concerns. However, this may be limited to only a few developments for review as publicity does help in branding to some extent for the company and/or the funder. Furthermore, due to the rapid need to share the status of these developments, there may be reporting bias in some details provided by authors of the scientific articles or commentary articles in traditional media. Lastly, while it is not viable for any form of quality assessment and metaanalysis of the selected articles due to the limited data provided and the heterogeneous style of reporting by different articles, this paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the potential developments of these pharmaceutical interventions during the early phase of the outbreak. This systematic review would be useful for cross-check when the quality assessment and meta-analysis of these developments are performed as a follow-up study.Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are key pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. Many potential developments on these pharmaceutical interventions for 2019-nCoV are ongoing in the containment phase of this outbreak, potentially due to better pandemic preparedness than before. However, lessons from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have shown that the journeys for these developments can still be challenging moving ahead.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Table S1 : Example of full search strategy in Pubmed, Table S2 : Google Search: 2019-nCoV diagnostics, Table S3 : Summary of diagnostic assays developed for 2019-nCoV, Table S4 "
nzvuugls,Puzzle of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (2019-nCoV),"At present, a total of 14 full-length genome sequences of 2019-nCoV have been submitted to GISAID and among them only one has been released on GenBank (Accession No: MN908947) (Ji et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses are classified into four sub-families based on their genetic properties, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronavirus. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus beta-coronavirus and can induce severe respiratory diseases in humans (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) .Phylogenetic analysis of genomic sequences of coronavirus deposited in the GenBank revealed that 2019-nCoV also belonged to the genus beta-coronavirus and displayed the closest linkage with two SARS-like coronaviruses from bat (Benvenuto et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The spike glycoprotein (S protein) is responsible for the receptor binding and membrane fusion. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV on the surface of human cells. Recent research demonstrated that ACE2 is also required for 2019-nCoV entry (Letko and Munster, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020) . The binding affinity of receptorbinding domain (RBD) of S protein present in coronavirus is related to virus infectivity and pathogenicity. Another study showed that, in comparison to human SARS-CoV, the RBD of 2019-nCoV exhibited much lower affinity to ACE2 indicating a possible lower virulence of 2019-nCoV (Dong et al., 2020) .In addition to the major structural proteins, SARS-CoV genome encodes several accessory proteins and some of them play important roles with rapid evolution (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) . ORF8 encoded protein is an example of what can be learned. During the early stages of SARS-CoV outbreak, the ORF8 gene coded for a single protein, but during the middle and late stages of the epidemic, the gene underwent a gradual 29 nt deletion and coded for two separate accessory proteins, ORF8a and ORF8b. It was hypothesized that this truncation event was responsible for the increased human-to human transmission efficiency that occurred during the late stages, triggering an epidemic. Interestingly, the 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV led to an attenuating mutation with a reduction in virus replication levels (Muth et al., 2018; Oostra et al., 2007) . Perhaps this attenuation was the potential reason why it was possible to eventually extinguish the outbreak. Unfortunately, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV shows that ORF8 is intact. If the gene does not undergo a gradual loss or mutation during subsequent virus circulation in humans, the outbreak could be more severe.In the early stages of an outbreak, most people do not have a reliable understanding of the susceptibility of the virus to antiviral drugs. Looking back on the medications used to fight SARS-CoV, initially ribavirin was recognized as a widely active antiviral drug that was effective against a range of RNA viruses but was of little use to SARS patients. The in vitro activities of ribavirin on the replication of SARS-CoV are highly variable, depending on the type of cells used for assays. Many SARS patients were treated with a combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids, given such poor prognosis linked to drug side effects (Cinatl et al., 2003a) . In some countries, interferon alpha (IFN-α) is used in combination with immunoglobulin or thymosin and has a therapeutic effect (Zhao et al., 2003) . In addition, there are reports that interferon beta (IFN-β) is significantly better than IFN-α and also that polyethylene glycol-modified IFN-α prevented SARS-CoV infection, reduced viral replication, and reduced histopathology during treatment (Cinatl et al., 2003b; Haagmans et al., 2004) . To identify potential drugs for 2019-nCoV, the viral protease (Mpro) was modeled by Prof. Zihe Rao's group at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. They selected a series of potential drugs which exist in the market or the selfbuilt database's high-cost medicinal compounds and medicinal plant sources database compounds. Thirty drug candidates, consisting of biologically active natural products and traditional Chinese medicine drugs, that have the potential to show therapeutic effects against 2019-nCoV, were chosen for testing for the clinical treatment of pneumonia in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.Based on previous anti-SARS studies and computer simulations, older drugs, like cinnamon thiamine and cyclosporin A (CsA), could be effective against 2019-nCoV. The immunosuppressive drug CsA prevents the nucleocapsid protein of the virus from binding to cyclophilin A (CypA) of the host cell, which has a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, and a combination of interferon and CsA has been shown previously to significantly inhibit the replication and tissue damage caused by coronavirus infection in bronchi and lungs of humans. Pfefferle et al. detected specific interactions between CypA and SARS-nCoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) by yeast-two-hybrid and other protein-protein interaction techniques. They also tested the drug CsA against a variety of coronaviruses and identified it to be a ""pan-coronavirus inhibitor"" (Haagmans et al., 2004) . Since then, many inhibitors have been designed and synthesized to act against coronavirus, but few have experienced systematic toxicity in pre-clinical studies, and these compounds have not yet been used in clinical trials to prevent the recurrence of SARS-CoV or 2019-nCoV. This is one of the main difficulties in drug development.Global public health concerns are focused against a number of known and well-characterized infections. However, the outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel 2019-nCoV virus is a reminder that importance should be given to predicting the risk of novel virus infections in humans (Thompson, 2020) . As this outbreak continues, more risk models are needed to help refine the risk assessment, which when pieced together with the emerging data will permit regular refinement and ensure optimal management of patients and healthy populations.At present, complete genomes of different 2019-nCoV have been released, and the latest published information on these genomes provides peer-reviewed information that is urgently needed to improve the risk assessment and response, which occurs in real time (Chen et al., 2020b; Riou and Althaus, 2020) . The possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus is still under investigation. Understanding the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and for determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. The situation is severe and it is urgent for us to need a better understanding towards this virus for further prevention and control. In order to better understand the early transmission pattern of 2019-nCoV, Julien et al. conducted a randomized simulation study of the early outbreak trajectories consistent with the epidemiological findings to date (Riou and Althaus, 2020). They suggested that a rapid establishment of sustained transmission chains from single cases cannot be ruled out, and at this stage, particularly attention should be given to the prevention of superspreading events. Chen et al. reported a mathematical model for simulating the transmission of the novel Wuhan Coronavirus, which is a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source to the humans (Chen et al., 2020a) . In another study, a data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak was conducted by Zhao et al. and a preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was made. They estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via the basic reproduction number based on only the data from the early stages of the outbreak (Zhao et al., 2020a) .However, many other important aspects of virus biology, such as, whether the virus can travel across continents, the list of species it can infect and whether it can cause severe mortality, are much harder to forecast. Our premise is that the amount of sequencing data currently available and the latest advances in computing methods using that data will make it possible for the first time to generate virtual models of how viruses evolve in each environment and how those viruses behave. Such models have the potential to make risk assessments as they arise that can be used to inform policy and direct strategies to head off impending threats.To date, many problems remain to be solved, including the virus' origin, extent, and duration of transmission in humans, its ability to infect animal hosts, its spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections, and an effective vaccine development.At the heart of vaccine development is the question of immunology and it is crucial to understand the immunological questions associated with viral infections. The clinical characteristics and treatment of 2019-nCoV and SARS both suggested a serious problem of immunopathology, particularly in the lung mucosa, which is complex and unique. It might be due to the fact that a systematic protective immune response is not enough to protect against viral infection. Currently, one of the most dangerous but valuable experiments is to perform tests on immune cells in the blood and lungs of infected patients, preferably during different stages of viral infection. Data on clinical immunity can lay the foundation for future vaccine development. We need to be aware of the challenges and concerns that 2019-nCoV poses to our community. Every effort should be made to understand and control the disease. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

qzbqxjdi,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target,"SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced [3] . A phylogenetic analysis [3, 4] found a bat origin for the SARS-CoV-2. There is a diversity of possible intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, including pangolins, but not mice and rats [5] .There are many similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with the original SARS-CoV. Using computer modeling, Xu et al. [6] found that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have almost identical 3-D structures in the receptor-binding domain that maintains van der Waals forces. SARS-CoV spike protein has a strong binding affinity to human ACE2, based on biochemical interaction studies and crystal structure analysis [7] . SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins share 76.5% identity in amino acid sequences [6] and, importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins have a high degree of homology [6, 7] .Wan et al. [4] reported that residue 394 (glutamine) in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), corresponding to residue 479 in SARS-CoV, can be recognized by the critical lysine 31 on the human ACE2 receptor [8] . Further analysis even suggested that SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV increasing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from person to person [4] . Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted to also have a strong binding affinity to human ACE2.This similarity with SARS-CoV is critical because ACE2 is a functional SARS-CoV receptor in vitro [9] and in vivo [10] . It is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. Overexpression of human ACE2 enhanced disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, demonstrating that viral entry into cells is a critical step [11] ; injecting SARS-CoV spike into mice worsened lung injury. Critically, this injury was attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway and depended on ACE2 expression [12] . Thus, for SARS-CoV pathogenesis, ACE2 is not only the entry receptor of the virus but also protects from lung injury. We therefore previously suggested that in contrast to most other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV became highly lethal because the virus deregulates a lung protective pathway [10, 12] .Zhou et al. [13] demonstrated that overexpressing ACE2 from different species in HeLa cells with human ACE2, pig ACE2, civet ACE2 (but not mouse ACE2) allowed SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, thereby directly showing that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. They further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 does not use other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [13] . In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly binds with the host cell surface ACE2 receptor facilitating virus entry and replication.A key question is why the lung appears to be the most vulnerable target organ. One reason is that the vast surface area of the lung makes the lung highly susceptible to inhaled viruses, but there is also a biological factor. Using normal lung tissue from eight adult donors, Zhao et al. [14] demonstrated that 83% of ACE2-expressing cells were alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), suggesting that these cells can serve as a reservoir for viral invasion. In addition, gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the ACE2-expressing AECII have high levels of multiple viral process-related genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life cycle, viral assembly, and viral genome replication [14] , suggesting that the ACE2-expressing AECII facilitate coronaviral replication in the lung.Expression of the ACE2 receptor is also found in many extrapulmonary tissues including heart, kidney, endothelium, and intestine [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Importantly, ACE2 is highly expressed on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells, functioning as a co-receptor for nutrient uptake, in particular for amino acid resorption from food [20] . We therefore predict that the intestine might also be a major entry site for SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection might have been initiated by eating food from the Wuhan market, the putative site of the outbreak. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can indeed infect the human gut epithelium has important implications for fecal-oral transmission and containment of viral spread. ACE2 tissue distribution in other organs could explain the multi-organ dysfunction observed in patients [21] [22] [23] . Of note, however, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [24], whether a person can get COVID-19 by touching surfaces or objects that have virus on them and then touching mucus membranes is yet to be confirmed.There are several potential therapeutic approaches (Fig. 1) .Development of a spike1 subunit protein-based vaccine may rely on the fact that ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Cell lines that facilitate viral replication in the presence of ACE2 may be most efficient in large-scale vaccine production. 2. Inhibition of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) activity.Hoffman et al. [25] recently demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor [26, 27] . The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, approved in Japan to treat unrelated diseases, has been shown to block TMPRSS2 activity [28, 29] and is thus an interesting candidate.The interaction sites between ACE2 and SARS-CoV have been identified at the atomic level and from studies to date should also hold true for interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2. Thus, one could target this interaction site with antibodies or small molecules.Kuba et al. [10] demonstrated in mice that SARS-CoV downregulates ACE2 protein (but not ACE) by binding its spike protein, contributing to severe lung injury. This suggests that excessive ACE2 may competitively bind with SARS-CoV-2 not only to neutralize the virus but also rescue cellular ACE2 activity which negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to protect the lung from injury [12, 30] . Indeed, enhanced ACE activity and decreased ACE2 availability contribute to lung injury during acid-and ventilator-induced lung injury [12, 31, 32] . Thus, treatment with a soluble form of ACE2 itself may exert dual functions: (1) slow viral entry into cells and hence viral spread [7, 9] and (2) protect the lung from injury [10, 12, 31, 32] .Notably, a recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; APN01, GSK2586881) has been found to be safe, with no negative hemodynamic effects in healthy volunteers and in a small cohort of patients with ARDS [33] [34] [35] . The administration of APN01 rapidly decreased levels of its proteolytic target peptide angiotensin II, with a trend to lower plasma IL-6 concentrations. Our previous work on SARS-CoV pathogenesis makes ACE2 a rational and scientifically validated therapeutic target for the current COVID-19 pandemic. The availability of recombinant ACE2 was the impetus to assemble a multinational team of intensivists, scientists, and biotech to rapidly initiate a pilot trial of rhACE2 in patients with severe COVID-19 (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04287686). Josef Penninger is the founder and a shareholder of Apeiron, the company that makes rhACE2. Arthur Slutsky has been a paid consultant for Apeiron.

The finding that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the ACE2 receptor for cell entry has important implications for understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenesis. SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 lead to downregulation of the ACE2 receptor, but not ACE, through binding of the spike protein with ACE2. This leads to viral entry and replication, as well as severe lung injury. Potential therapeutic approaches include a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based vaccine; a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor to block the priming of the spike protein; blocking the surface ACE2 receptor by using anti-ACE2 antibody or peptides; and a soluble form of ACE2 which should slow viral entry into cells through competitively binding with SARS-CoV-2 and hence decrease viral spread as well as protecting the lung from injury through its unique enzymatic function.

4yuw7jo3,Network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections 1 . In the past two decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality 2 . For example, 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion 3, 4 . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia 2 . In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2), as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated as COVID- 19) 5 , was found in Wuhan, China. As of 24 February 2020, there have been over 79,000 cases with over 2600 deaths for the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide; furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts 6 . However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.Although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development has increased significantly over the past two decades, the annual number of new treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has remained relatively constant and limited 7 . A recent study estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent $2.6 billion in 2015, up from $802 million in 2003, in the development of an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug 8 . Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials [9] [10] [11] . However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and time-consuming 12 . Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning [9] [10] [11] 13, 14 . However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when threedimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often has high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes 1 .Viruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replication during infection 1 . Systematic identification of virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) offers an effective way toward elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection 15, 16 . Subsequently, targeting cellular antiviral targets, such as virus-host interactome, may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viral infections 1 , including SARS-CoV 17 , MERS-CoV 17 , Ebola virus 18 , and Zika virus 14, [19] [20] [21] . We recently presented an integrated antiviral drug discovery pipeline that incorporated gene-trap insertional mutagenesis, known functional drug-gene network, and bioinformatics analyses 14 . This methodology allows to identify several candidate repurposable drugs for Ebola virus 11, 14 . Our work over the last decade has demonstrated how network strategies can, for example, be used to identify effective repurposable drugs 13, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and drug combinations 28 for multiple human diseases. For example, network-based drug-disease proximity sheds light on the relationship between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies 13, 23, 27, 28 .In this study, we present an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology, which combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) the proteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common PPIs and functional pathways elucidated by the human interactome ( Fig. 1) . We follow this analysis with bioinformatics validation of drug-induced gene signatures and HCoVinduced transcriptomics in human cell lines to inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action in a specific HCoV for which we propose repurposing (Fig. 1 ).To date, seven pathogenic HCoVs (Fig. 2a, b) have been found: 1, 29 (i) 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are β genera, and (ii) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are α genera. We performed the phylogenetic analyses using the wholegenome sequence data from 15 HCoVs to inspect the evolutionary relationship of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 with other HCoVs. We found that the whole genomes of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 had~99.99% nucleotide sequence identity across three diagnosed patients (Supplementary Table S1 ). The 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity (79.7%) with SARS-CoV among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs, revealing conserved evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 2a) .HCoVs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viral replications 29 , including replicase complex (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Fig. 2b) . The ORF1ab gene encodes the non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral RNA synthesis complex through proteolytic processing 30 . The nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. From the protein 3D structure view of SARS-CoV nsp12, it contains a larger N-terminal extension (which binds to nsp7 and nsp8) and polymerase domain (Fig. 2c) . The spike is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor 31, 32 . Figure 2d shows the 3D structure of the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6ACK). A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 is able to utilize ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells 33 , suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development. Furthermore, cryo-EM structure of the spike and biophysical assays reveal that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV 34 . In addition, the nucleocapsid is also an important subunit for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization 35 , and the single nucleocapsid structure is shown in Fig. 2e .Protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was most evolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2 ). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV (Supplementary  Table S2 ). However, the spike protein exhibited the lowest sequence conservation (sequence identity of 77%) between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 only has 31.9% sequence identity compared to MERS-CoV. Fig. 1 Overall workflow of this study. Our network-based methodology combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. a Human coronavirus (HCoV)-associated host proteins were collected from literatures and pooled to generate a pan-HCoV protein subnetwork. b Network proximity between drug targets and HCoV-associated proteins was calculated to screen for candidate repurposable drugs for HCoVs under the human protein interactome model. c, d Gene set enrichment analysis was utilized to validate the network-based prediction. e Top candidates were further prioritized for drug combinations using network-based method captured by the ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. f Overall hypothesis of the network-based methodology: (i) the proteins that functionally associate with HCoVs are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human interactome network; and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common protein-protein interactions elucidated by the human interactome.To depict the HCoV-host interactome network, we assembled the CoV-associated host proteins from four known HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), one mouse MHV, and one avian IBV (N protein) (Supplementary Table S3 ). In total, we obtained 119 host proteins associated with CoVs with various experimental evidence. Specifically, these host proteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucial pathways of HCoV infection. The HCoV-host interactome network is shown in Fig. 3a . We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value < 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and influenza (Fig. 3b ). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value < 0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology, viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virion attachment to host cell (Fig. 3c ). We then mapped the known drug-target network (see Materials and methods) into the HCoV-host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets. We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Fig. 3a) can be targeted by at least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trials. For example, GSK3B, DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins. The high druggability of HCoV-host interactome motivates us to develop a drug repurposing strategy by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with HCoVs for potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.The basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on the notions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern viral infection are localized in the corresponding subnetwork ( Fig. 1a) within the comprehensive human interactome network. For a drug with multiple targets to be effective against an HCoV, its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the corresponding subnetwork in the human protein-protein interactome ( Fig. 1 ), as we demonstrated in multiple diseases 13, 22, 23, 28 using this network-based strategy. We used a state-of-theart network proximity measure to quantify the relationship between HCoV-specific subnetwork (Fig. 3a) and drug targets in the human interactome. We constructed a drug-target network by assembling target information for more than 2000 FDA-approved or experimental drugs (see Materials and methods). To improve the quality and completeness of the human protein interactome network, we integrated PPIs with five types of experimental data: (1) binary PPIs from 3D protein structures; (2) binary PPIs from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays;(3) experimentally identified kinase-substrate interactions; (4) signaling networks derived from experimental data; and (5) literature-derived PPIs with various experimental evidence (see Materials and methods). We used a Z-score (Z) measure and permutation test to reduce the study bias in network proximity analyses (including hub nodes in the human interactome network by literature-derived PPI data bias) as described in our recent studies 13, 28 .In total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (Z < −1.5 and P < 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV-host interactome (Fig. 4a , Supplementary  Tables S4 and 5 ). To validate bias of the pooled cellular proteins from six CoVs, we further calculated the network proximities of all the drugs for four CoVs with a large number of know host proteins, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, and MHV, separately. We found that the Z-scores showed consistency among the pooled 119 HCoV-associated proteins and other four individual CoVs (Fig. 4b) . The Pearson correlation coefficients of the proximities of all the drugs for the pooled HCoV are 0.926 vs. SARS-CoV (P < 0.001, t distribution), 0.503 vs. MERS-CoV (P < 0.001), 0.694 vs. IBV (P < 0.001), and 0.829 vs. MHV (P < 0.001). These network proximity analyses offer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs.To further validate the 135 repurposable drugs against HCoVs, we first performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using transcriptome data of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infected host cells (see Methods). These transcriptome data were used as gene signatures for HCoVs. Additionally, we downloaded the gene expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database 36 to obtain drug-gene signatures. We calculated a GSEA score (see Methods) for each drug and used this score as an indication of bioinformatics validation of the 135 drugs. Specifically, an enrichment score (ES) was calculated for each HCoV data set, and ES > 0 and P < 0.05 (permutation test) was used as cut-off for a significant association of gene signatures between a drug and a specific HCoV data set. The GSEA score, ranging from 0 to 3, is the number of data sets that met these criteria for a specific drug. Mesalazine (an Fig. 4 A discovered drug-HCoV network. a A subnetwork highlighting network-predicted drug-HCoV associations connecting 135 drugs and HCoVs.

We next selected 16 high-confidence repurposable drugs ( Fig. 5a and Table 1 ) against HCoVs using subject matter expertise based on a combination of factors: (i) strength of the network-predicted associations (a smaller network proximity score in Supplementary Table S4 ); (ii) validation by GSEA analyses; (iii) literature-reported antiviral evidence, and (iv) fewer clinically reported side effects. Specifically, we showcased several selected repurposable drugs with literature-reported antiviral evidence as below.An overexpression of estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication 37 . Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been reported to play a broader role in inhibiting viral replication through the non-classical pathways associated with estrogen receptor 37 . SERMs interfere at the post viral entry step and affect the triggering of fusion, as the SERMs' antiviral activity still can be observed in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression 18 . Toremifene (Z = -3.23, Fig. 5a ), the first generation of nonsteroidal SERM, exhibits potential effects in blocking various viral infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus in established cell lines 17, 38 . Compared to the classical ESR1-related antiviral pathway, toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein, and eventually inhibiting viral replication 39 . As shown in Fig. 5b , toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with HCoV, such as RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I, EIF3F, and EIF3E 40, 41 . Equilin (Z = -2.52 and GSEA score = 3), an estrogenic steroid produced by horses, also has been proven to have moderate activity in inhibiting the entry of Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein and human immunodeficiency virus (ZEBOV-GP/HIV) 18 . Altogether, network-predicted SERMs (such as toremifene and equilin) offer candidate repurposable drugs for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to associate with viral infection, including HCoVs [42] [43] [44] . Irbesartan (Z = -5.98), a typical ARB, was approved by the FDA for treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between irbesartan's targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Fig. 5c , irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus inhibiting viral entry 45, 46 . SLC10A1 interacts with C11orf74, a potential transcriptional repressor that interacts with nsp-10 of SARS-CoV 47 . There are several other ARBs (such as eletriptan, frovatriptan, and zolmitriptan) in which their targets are potentially associated with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome.Previous studies have confirmed the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as the key factor in regulating various viruses' replications, including Andes orthohantavirus and coronavirus 48, 49 . Sirolimus (Z = -2.35 and GSEA score = 3), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was reported to effectively block viral protein expression and virion release effectively 50 . Indeed, the latest study revealed the clinical application: sirolimus reduced MERS-CoV infection by over 60% 51 . Moreover, sirolimus usage in managing patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure can improve those patients' prognosis significantly 50 . Mercaptopurine (Z = -2.44 and GSEA score = 1), an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property, has been used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn's disease 52 .(see figure on previous page) Fig. 5 A discovered drug-protein-HCoV network for 16 candidate repurposable drugs. a Network-predicted evidence and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) scores for 16 potential repurposable drugs for HCoVs. The overall connectivity of the top drug candidates to the HCoVassociated proteins was examined. Most of these drugs indirectly target HCoV-associated proteins via the human protein-protein interaction networks. All the drug-target-HCoV-associated protein connections were examined, and those proteins with at least five connections are shown. The box heights for the proteins indicate the number of connections. GSEA scores for eight drugs were not available (NA) due to the lack of transcriptome profiles for the drugs. b-e Inferred mechanism-of-action networks for four selected drugs: b toremifene (first-generation nonsteroidalselective estrogen receptor modulator), c irbesartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker), d mercaptopurine (an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties), and e melatonin (a biogenic amine for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders). 53, 54 . Mechanistically, mercaptopurine potentially target several host proteins in HCoVs, such as JUN, PABPC1, NPM1, and NCL 40, 55 (Fig. 5d) .Inflammatory pathways play essential roles in viral infections 56, 57 . As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = -1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections 58, 59 . Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on the function of multiple organs 60 . The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients' clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription 61, 62 . In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients' survival time, which may provide a chance for patients' immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Fig. 5e , melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cell-derived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus 63 .In summary, our network proximity analyses offer multiple candidate repurposable drugs that target diverse cellular pathways for potential prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. However, further preclinical experiments 64 and clinical trials are required to verify the clinical benefits of these network-predicted candidates before clinical use.Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play an important role in treating various viral infections 65 . However, our ability to identify and validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both the large number of drug pairs and dosage combinations. In our recent study, we proposed a novel network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations 28 . Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, we found that a drug combination was therapeutically effective only if it was captured by the ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the disease module, but target separate neighborhoods (Fig. 6a) . Here we sought to identify drug combinations that may provide a synergistic effect in potentially treating 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 with welldefined mechanism-of-action by network analysis. For the 16 potential repurposable drugs (Fig. 5a, Table 1 ), we showcased three network-predicted candidate drug combinations for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. All predicted possible combinations can be found in Supplementary  Table S6 .Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties, has demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure 50 . The mTOR signaling plays an essential role for MERS-CoV infection 66 . Dactinomycin, also known actinomycin D, is an approved RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various cancer types. An early study showed that dactinomycin (1 μg/ml) inhibited the growth of feline enteric CoV 67 . As shown in Fig. 6b , our network analysis shows that sirolimus and dactinomycin synergistically target HCoV-associated host protein subnetwork by ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern, offering potential combination regimens for treatment of HCoV. Specifically, sirolimus and dactinomycin may inhibit both mTOR signaling and RNA synthesis pathway (including DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B)) in HCoV-infected cells (Fig. 6b) .Toremifene is among the approved first-generation nonsteroidal SERMs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer 68 . SERMs (including toremifene) inhibited Ebola virus infection 18 by interacting with and destabilizing the Ebola virus glycoprotein 39 . In vitro assays have demonstrated that toremifene inhibited growth of MERS-CoV 17,69 and SARA-CoV 38 (Table 1) . Emodin, an anthraquinone derivative extracted from the roots of rheum tanguticum, has been reported to have various anti-virus effects. Specifically, emdoin inhibited SARS-CoV-associated 3a protein 70 , and blocked an interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 (ref. 71 ). Altogether, network analyses and published experimental data suggested that combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for 2019-nCoV/ SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 6c) .As shown in Fig. 5a , targets of both mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoVassociated host proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease 53, 54 . Melatonin was reported in potential antiviral infection via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Melatonin indirectly regulates ACE2 expression, a key entry receptor involved in viral infection of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 33 ). Specifically, melatonin was reported to inhibit calmodulin and calmodulin interacts with ACE2 by inhibiting shedding of its ectodomain, a key infectious process of SARS-CoV 72, 73 . JUN, also known as c-Jun, is a key host protein involving in HCoV infectious bronchitis virus 74 . As shown in Fig. 6d , mercaptopurine and melatonin may synergistically block c-Jun signaling by targeting multiple cellular targets. In summary, combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential combination therapy for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 by synergistically targeting papainlike protease, ACE2, c-Jun signaling, and antiinflammatory pathways (Fig. 6d) . However, further experimental observations on ACE2 pathways by melatonin in 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are highly warranted.In this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Integration of drug-target networks, HCoV-host interactions, HCoVinduced transcriptome in human cell lines, and human protein-protein interactome network are essential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16 candidate repurposable drugs (Fig. 5 ) and 3 potential drug combinations (Fig. 6) for targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. However, although the majority of predictions have been validated by various literature data (Table 1) , all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in various 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 experimental assays 64 and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients.We acknowledge several limitations in the current study. Although 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shared high nucleotide sequence identity with other HCoVs (Fig. 2) , our predictions are not 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 specific by lack of the known host proteins on 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. We used a low binding affinity value of 10 μM as a threshold to define a physical drug-target interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1 μM) may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug-target network. Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large scale, experimentally reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug-target interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. For example, Silvestrol, a natural product from the flavagline, was found to have antiviral activity against Ebola 75 and Coronaviruses 76 . After adding its target, an RNA helicase enzyme EIF4A 76 , silvestrol was predicted to be significantly associated with HCoVs (Z = -1.24, P = 0.041) by network proximity analysis. To increase coverage of drug-target networks, we may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further 25, 26 . In addition, the collected virus-host interactions are far from completeness and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 using sequence-based and structure-based approaches 77 . Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles 78 , as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists vs. agonists). The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic (antiviral) effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virus-host interactions. Comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays 79, 80 , will significantly improve the accuracy of the proposed network-based methodologies further.Owing to a lack of the complete drug-target information (such as the molecular ""promiscuity"" of drugs), the dose-response and dose-toxicity effects for both (see figure on previous page) Fig. 6 Network-based rational design of drug combinations for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. a The possible exposure mode of the HCoVassociated protein module to the pairwise drug combinations. An effective drug combination will be captured by the ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. Z CA and Z CB denote the network proximity (Z-score) between targets (Drugs A and B) and a specific HCoV. S AB denotes separation score (see Materials and methods) of targets between Drug A and Drug B. b-d Inferred mechanism-of-action networks for three selected pairwise drug combinations: b sirolimus (a potent immunosuppressant with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties) plus dactinomycin (an RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various tumors), c toremifene (first-generation nonsteroidal-selective estrogen receptor modulator) plus emodin (an experimental drug for the treatment of polycystic kidney), and d melatonin (a biogenic amine for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders) plus mercaptopurine (an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties).repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in the current network models. For example, Mesalazine, an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a top network-predicted repurposable drug associated with HCoVs (Fig. 5a ). Yet, several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) associated with mesalazine usage 81, 82 . Integration of lung-specific gene expression 23 of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 host proteins and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling 83 may reduce side effects of repurposable drugs or drug combinations. Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework 28 . However, we expect that our methodology remain to be a useful network-based tool for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs' targets with the HCoV-host subnetwork in the human interactome. Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir 64 ) with the network-predicted repurposable drugs (Fig. 5 ) or drug combinations (Fig. 6 ) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework 16 .In conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrative network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/ SARS-CoV-2. Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other emerging viral infections and other human complex diseases as well.In total, we collected DNA sequences and protein sequences for 15 HCoVs, including three most recent 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 genomes, from the NCBI GenBank database (28 January 2020, Supplementary  Table S1 ). Whole-genome alignment and protein sequence identity calculation were performed by Multiple Sequence Alignment in EMBL-EBI database (https:// www.ebi.ac.uk/) with default parameters. The neighbor joining (NJ) tree was computed from the pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix using MEGA X 84 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The protein alignment and phylogenetic tree of HCoVs were constructed by MEGA X 84 .We collected HCoV-host protein interactions from various literatures based on our sizeable efforts. The HCoV-associated host proteins of several HCoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, MHV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 were pooled. These proteins were either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or were involved in critical pathways of HCoV infection identified by multiple experimental sources, including highthroughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, viral protein pull-down assay, in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and RNA knock down experiment. In total, the virus-host interaction network included 6 HCoVs with 119 host proteins (Supplementary Table S3 ).Next, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to evaluate the biological relevance and functional pathways of the HCoV-associated proteins. All functional analyses were performed using Enrichr 85 .Here, we collected drug-target interaction information from the DrugBank database (v4.3) 86 , Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) 87 , PharmGKB database, ChEMBL (v20) 88 , BindingDB 89 , and IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 90 . The chemical structure of each drug with SMILES format was extracted from Drug-Bank 86 . Here, drug-target interactions meeting the following three criteria were used: (i) binding affinities, including K i , K d , IC 50 , or EC 50 each ≤10 μM; (ii) the target was marked as ""reviewed"" in the UniProt database 91 ; and (iii) the human target was represented by a unique Uni-Prot accession number. The details for building the experimentally validated drug-target network are provided in our recent studies 13, 23, 28 .To build a comprehensive list of human PPIs, we assembled data from a total of 18 bioinformatics and systems biology databases with five types of experimental evidence: (i) binary PPIs tested by high-throughput yeasttwo-hybrid (Y2H) systems; (ii) binary, physical PPIs from protein 3D structures; (iii) kinase-substrate interactions by literature-derived low-throughput or high-throughput experiments; (iv) signaling network by literature-derived low-throughput experiments; and (v) literature-curated PPIs identified by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS), Y2H, or by literature-derived low-throughput experiments. All inferred data, including evolutionary analysis, gene expression data, and metabolic associations, were excluded. The genes were mapped to their Entrez ID based on the NCBI database 92 as well as their official gene symbols based on GeneCards (https:// www.genecards.org/). In total, the resulting human protein-protein interactome used in this study includes 351,444 unique PPIs (edges or links) connecting 17,706 proteins (nodes), representing a 50% increase in the number of the PPIs we have used previously. Detailed descriptions for building the human protein-protein interactome are provided in our previous studies 13, 23, 28, 93 .We posit that the human PPIs provide an unbiased, rational roadmap for repurposing drugs for potential treatment of HCoVs in which they were not originally approved. Given C, the set of host genes associated with a specific HCoV, and T, the set of drug targets, we computed the network proximity of C with the target set T of each drug using the ""closest"" method:where d(c, t) is the shortest distance between gene c and t in the human protein interactome. The network proximity was converted to Z-score based on permutation tests:where d r and σ r were the mean and standard deviation of the permutation test repeated 1000 times, each time with two randomly selected gene lists with similar degree distributions to those of C and T. The corresponding P value was calculated based on the permutation test results. Z-score < −1.5 and P < 0.05 were considered significantly proximal drug-HCoV associations. All networks were visualized using Gephi 0.9.2 (https://gephi.org/).For this network-based approach for drug combinations to be effective, we need to establish if the topological relationship between two drug-target modules reflects biological and pharmacological relationships, while also quantifying their network-based relationship between drug targets and HCoV-associated host proteins (drug-drug-HCoV combinations). To identify potential drug combinations, we combined the top lists of drugs. Then, ""separation"" measure S AB was calculated for each pair of drugs A and B using the following method:where d Á h i was calculated based on the ""closest"" method. Our key methodology is that a drug combination is therapeutically effective only if it follows a specific relationship to the disease module, as captured by Complementary Exposure patterns in targets' modules of both drugs without overlapping toxic mechanisms 28 .We performed the gene set enrichment analysis as an additional prioritization method. We first collected three differential gene expression data sets of hosts infected by HCoVs from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Among them, two transcriptome data sets were SARS-CoV-infected samples from patient's peripheral blood 94 (GSE1739) and Calu-3 cells 95 (GSE33267), respectively. One transcriptome data set was MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells 96 (GSE122876). Adjusted P value less than 0.01 was defined as differentially expressed genes. These data sets were used as HCoV-host signatures to evaluate the treatment effects of drugs. Differential gene expression in cells treated with various drugs were retrieved from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database 36 , and were used as gene profiles for the drugs. For each drug that was in both the CMAP data set and our drug-target network, we calculated an enrichment score (ES) for each HCoV signature data set based on previously described methods 97 where j = 1, 2, …, s were the genes of HCoV signature data set sorted in ascending order by their rank in the gene profiles of the drug being evaluated. The rank of gene j is denoted by V(j), where 1 ≤ V(j) ≤ r, with r being the number of genes (12,849) from the drug profile. Then, ES up/down was set to a up/down if a up/down > b up/down , and was set to −b up/down if b up/down > a up/down . Permutation tests repeated 100 times using randomly generated gene lists with the same number of up-and down-regulated genes as the HCoV signature data set were performed to measure the significance of the ES scores. Drugs were considered to have potential treatment effect if ES > 0 and P < 0.05, and the number of such HCoV signature data sets were used as the final GSEA score that ranges from 0 to 3."
bxth3pqm,"A Novel Coronavirus Outbreak from Wuhan City in China, Rapid Need for Emergency Departments Preparedness and Response; a Letter to Editor","On 31 December 2019, Chinese authorities reported the increase in incidence of severe pneumonia in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China. One week later, on January 7th, they confirmed that they had identified a new coronavirus, which is a family of microRNA respiratory viruses including the common cold, and viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This new virus was temporarily named ""2019-nCoV"". Wuhan city is a major international transport hub. This report to World Health Organization (WHO), raised global public health concern because this is the third coronavirus âȂŞassociated acute respiratory illness outbreak. Currently, up to the date of submitting this letter, 4593 cases of 2019-nCoV infections have been confirmed globally, both in China (4537 have been confirmed, 976 of them presented with severe disease and 106 died) and outside of China (56 confirmed in 14 countries.). WHO risk assessment of 2019-nCoV infection is Very High in China and High in other countries (1). Although 2019-nCoV has not been included in the WHO blueprint list of priority diseases yet, MERS CoV, and SARS -CoV, which are already included in this list, are both coronaviruses that have led to global outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively. The specific source and the exact primary mode of transmission of 2019-nCoV to humans remain unknown. The clinical features and laboratory and radiological abnormalities with 2019-nCoV infections are not specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Adults and pediatrics who ac-quire a 2019-nCoV infection can show a spectrum of respiratory illness severity, from asymptomatic to mild, moderate or severe disease. The severe disease manifests as severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or severe pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock. Patients with pre-existing medical comorbidities develop a more severe disease and have higher mortality rates compared to patients who do not have any comorbidity. Clinical care of patients with suspected 2019-nCoV should focus on early recognition, immediate isolation (separation), implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and provision optimized supportive care. At the triage of an Emergency room, early recognition of suspected patients allows for timely initiation of IPC. 2019-nCoV should be considered as a possible etiology of influenza like illness (ILI) under certain situations according to case definitions of WHO (2) . Both the health care worker (HCW) and the suspected case of acute respiratory illness (ALI) should wear a medical mask and the patient should better be directed to a separate area, an isolation room if available. Otherwise, keep a distance of at least one meter between suspected patients and other patients. Instruct all suspected patients to cover their nose and mouth during coughing or sneezing with tissue or flexed elbows for protecting others. Those with mild or moderate clinical presentations of the 2019-nCoV infection may not require hospitalization, unless there is concern of rapid deterioration. All patients discharged to go home directly from fast track in emergency room should be instructed to consider IPC measures and to return hospital if their symptoms worsen (3). Patients with severe illness, who are admitted to the emergency ward, should be transferred to the floor and if available to the ICU ward as soon as possible. As long as they stay in emergency ward, they should be placed in single rooms or grouped together with those who have the same etiological or clinical diagnosis. Limit patient movement within the center and ensure that patients wear medical masks when outside their rooms. HCW should perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions. Droplet and contact precautions prevent direct or indirect transmission of the disease from contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment. HCW should use personal protective equipment (PPE) including medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown, when entering the room and remove PPE when leaving. If equipment needs to be shared among patients, they should be cleaned and disinfected after each patient's use. HCW should apply airborne precautions when performing an aerosol generating procedure (i.e. open suctioning of respiratory tract, intubation, bronchoscopy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) (4). HCW should immediately provide supplemental oxygen therapy for patients with SARI and respiratory distress, hypoxemia or shock. Oxygen therapy flow rate should be aimed at Spo2>=90%, Spo2>=92-95% and Spo2>=94%, in non-pregnant, pregnant and children, respectively. HCW should recognize severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when a patient with respiratory distress is failing standard oxygen therapy. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS among these patients commonly results from intrapulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt and usually requires mechanical ventilation. Thus, rapid sequence intubation should be performed using airborne precautions. Implementation of mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4-8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is suggested. Patients with SARI should be treated cautiously with intravenous fluids when there is no evidence of shock, because aggressive fluid resuscitation may worsen oxygenation. For resuscitation of septic shock in adults, at least 30 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid should be infused in the first 3 hours of shock identification and in children rapid bolus of 20 ml/kg as loading dose and up to 40-60 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid infusion in the first hour of shock identification is needed. Vasopressor should be administered when shock persists during or after fluid resuscitation. If signs of poor perfusion persist despite reaching mean arterial pressure (MAP) target (i.e. >65 mmHg) with fluids and vasopressor, consider administering an inotrope such as dobutamine. Empiric antimicrobials should be initiated within one hour of identification of sepsis to treat all likely pathogens causing SARI. Empiric antibiotic treatment should be based on the clinical diagnosis of severe pneumonia or sepsis, local epidemi-ology and susceptibility data as well as treatment guidelines. If influenza is also a concern and there is a local circulation of influenza virus, a neuraminidase inhibitor should be adjoined to empiric therapy. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be de-escalated on the basis of microbiology results and clinical judgment. Systemic corticosteroids should not be routinely adding to therapy unless indicated for another reason. Collection of clinical specimens for laboratory diagnosis is suggested in early outbreak period and after that it is only advised for investigational purposes. If laboratory diagnosis is considered, serology is recommended only when RT-PCR is not available. Otherwise, HCW should collect specimens from both the upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract for testing 2019-nCoV via RT-PCR (5). At the time being, emergency preparedness and response for providing appropriate care to the patients suspected to coronavirus-associated acute respiratory illness (abovementioned plans) should be developed and implemented in the emergency departments, as the frontline of treating human infections of 2019-nCov in the hospitals.None.None."

qdt90c22,Unrevealing sequence and structural features of novel coronavirus using in silico approaches: The main protease as molecular target,"At present there is not specific treatment for coronavirus infection. However, prior outbreaks have helped to decipher the main pharmacological targets in these viruses. The therapies have been focused on targeting protease, helicase, polymerase, and using immunomodulators such as interferons and corticosteroids (Zumla et al., 2016) . Ribavi-rin alone or combined with IFN has been the most common therapeutic intervention in patients with SARS and MERS (Khalid et al., 2015) . Also, protease inhibitors have been used in vitro and in vivo to block coronavirus replication. Lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) are protease inhibitors currently used in HIV therapy that could block SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV main proteases (Savarino 2005) . The combination of lopinavir or ri-tonavir with ribavirin was associated with improvement in clinical outcome, compared with ribavirin alone, in SARS-CoV-infected patients (Lai, 2005) . During the MERS-CoV outbreak, the Food and Drugs Administration approved the use of ritonavir/lopinavir, based mainly on data obtained from in vitro studies (Sheahan et al 2020) . Altogether, these data support the assumption that some protease inhibitors may have an antiviral effect by blocking coronavirus main protease. However, like other RNA viruses, the main challenge associated with antiviral therapy is the selection of resistant variants. Mechanisms of generation of diversity in coronavirus are related to a moderate error rate of the polymerase (with proof-reading capacity) and homologous or heterologous recombination, factors that lead to antigenic drift and shift, similar to those described for Influenza viruses (Menachery et al., 2017) . Thus, viral replication will produce a diverse population of genome variants having different fitness profiles. These variants could be associated with the development of drug resistance (Yin and Wunderink, 2018; Pruijssers and Denison, 2019) . The ongoing efforts toward discovering efficient drugs to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection should include the prior structural and pharmacological knowledge gained with the other coronavirus outbreaks. Based on that, in this work was established a comparative theoretical study to rationalize the potential use of protease inhibitors as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infections.Protein sequences of the main protease were individually retrieved from GenBank (accession numbers are shown in the phylogenetic tree, Figure 1 ) for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and several Bat-CoV from the genus Betacoronavirus.The coordinates for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases were obtained from the protein data bank, PDB code 1UJ1/2GX4 and 6LU7 respectively. Also, HIV-1 protease bounded to lopinavir under PDB code 1MIU and Bat HKU4 coronavirus PDB code 2YNB were evaluated. The PDB files to be used under further computational analysis were optimized by removing cocrystallized molecules and all crystallographic water molecules. Hydrogens were added and partial charges were assigned to all atoms. The obtained PDB files for each protein were further submitted to restrained molecular mechanics refinement. All molecular dynamics simulations described in this study were performed with NAMD 2.12 (Phillips et al., 2005) , Vega ZZ 3.1.0.21 (Pedretti et al., 2004; Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010) as described in Ortega et al. (2019) . Following, structural analysis of the binding pocket was developed by using CASTp 3.0 software using the http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ server. The ligand-binding pocket located in the catalytic site was obtained manually and then verified by a priori docking approach with lopinavir by using the Achilles Blind Docking server (Sánchez-Linares et al., 2012) . The 3D structure of each inhibitor was obtained from PubChem. Also, public libraries for protease inhibitors were obtained from PubChem and ZINC databases. Molecular docking was performed with VINA/VegaZZ 3.1.0.21 and 30 runs conducted for each compound. The results were prioritized according to the predicted binding energy in kcal/mol. The results obtained from the docking simulation were visualized with the Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer 17.2.0 software.A comprehensive analysis of physicochemical descriptors, as well as ADME parameters, pharmacokinetic properties, druglike nature, and medicinal chemistry for the top 5 compounds obtained from the library virtually screened, was carried out by using SWISSADME tools. These tools were asset through the website at http://www.swissadme.ch.Phylogenetic analysis of the main protease protein sequences of SARS-CoVs and Bat-CoVs is shown in Figure 1 . The results are in agreement with recent reports of an independent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from a Bat-CoV, different from the spillover which led to the introduction of SARS-CoV, being the Bat-CoV of Rhinolophus affinis the probable ancestor of this new virus (Wong et al., 2020) . The sequences of the whole main protease of this Bat-CoV and of SARS-CoV-2 share 99.3 % identity, while the MERS-CoV protease was only 50.6% identical ( Figure 1 ). The main protease sequence is highly conserved among all the SARS-like coronaviruses from human and related CoVs from other animals ( Figure 1 ). The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins exhibit 96 % sequence identity to each other ( Figure 1 ). Figure 2 shows the 3D representation for Bat-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases and indeed, very similar structures were observed, particularly when comparing SARS-CoV proteases, although very different to the one of HIV-1. Interestingly the SARS-CoV-2 protease shares 21/29 amino acids involved in the drug interaction with SARS-CoV protease, while this later exhibits only 21 amino acids involved in this interaction (Figure 3 ). SARS-CoV-2 protease has an active site with a surface accessible to solvent of 356Å and SARS-CoV only 256 Å (Figure 3 ). In silico data demonstrated that the different protease inhibitors, used against HIV-1, could interact with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 protease producing an interaction with a binding energy lower than -6.9 Kcal/mol. However, the compound that produced the strongest interaction with the active site was saquinavir, with a binding energy of -9.6 Kcal/mol (Table 1) . Binding energy of SARS-CoV-2 main protease to Saquinavir (SQV) and LPV were slightly higher, but similar, to the one of HIV-1 protease (Table 1 ). The interaction of LPV, SQV and RTV with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is shown in Figure 4 , the different amino-acids involved in the interaction with all these drugs are also shown.In order to contribute with further studies related to developing more effective drugs, in this work was evaluated a broad library of protease inhibitors available in the ZINC database (over 100 compounds) and PubChem (over 200 compounds). After molecular docking, compounds were prioritized based on binding energies. The top 20 compounds were clustered using a hierarchical matrix and represented into a heat map ( Figure 5 ). These compounds could be clustered into three big groups based on their chemical structures. Also, the binding energies and chemical motives for each compound are shown in Table 2 . Interestingly, in the output of this virtual screening at least 5 compounds, representatives of these chemical clusters with binding energy around -8.2 Kcal/mol, were obtained. These scaffolds could be used as leading compounds to fur-ther chemical optimization to develop more potent inhibitors. The structure and main ADME parameters for each inhibitor are shown in Figure 6 , in general the 5 compounds shown, have physicochemical parameters under the expected values for a good drug.Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, affecting more than 70 countries, therapeutic alternatives are urgently required. Viral main protease plays a pivotal role in coronavirus replication. This enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein, producing functional proteins that will be packed into the virion. The molecular study of SARS-CoV-2 protease showed that this virus has high homology with SARS-CoV protease. Previous data suggest the use of protease inhibitors as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV protease, in special some of those used for HIV-1 therapy. HIV-1 protease is an aspartyl protease, while in coronavirus it is a cysteine protease. However, the inhibition by protease inhibitors could be driven by a similar mechanism. HIV-1 is one of the best-studied models in antiviral research, their targets are well characterized and its inhibition by drugs has been broadly studied. Protease inhibitors play a main role in HIV-1 therapy. Furthermore, these compounds have shown inhibitory effects over proteases from pathogens such as Leishmania and malaria (Valdivieso et al., 2010; Sonoiki et al., 2016; de Wilde et al., 2014) . Thus, the use of protease inhibitors in other viral species could be supported by these non-specific protease inhibitions. Previous reports showed the inhibition of SARS-CoV protease by protease inhibitors used in HIV-1 therapy, being an interesting pharmacological target to treat SARS-CoV-2. Previously, scientific reports showed that some HIV-1 protease inhibitors could decrease SARS-CoV replication (Savarino, 2005) . Nevertheless, not all of the protease inhibitors showed the same efficacy against this virus (Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala, 2003) . Based on that, in this work, we established an in silico approach to validate the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease by HIV-1 protease inhibitor. The results showed that the main protease inhibitors used in HIV-1 therapy could produce a decrease in the protease activity in coronavirus enzyme. The compound with the highest binding affinity was saquinavir. Preliminary reports are showing that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with lopinavir could achieve viral clearance (Lim et al., 2020) .Our study suggests that drugs such as SQV and LPV have shown slightly higher, but comparative binding energies against the SARS-CoV-2, than HIV-1 protease. Thus, based on their safety profiles, SQV and LPV could be used as therapy and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce new infections by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the data obtained from prior outbreaks, the clinical results obtained by using protease inhibitors in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results shown here, support the use of protease inhibitors to treat SARS-CoV-2. In addition, to contribute to further development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, in this work experimental compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 protease were evaluated by virtual screening. Some compounds showed comparable binding energy values to the SARS-CoV-2 protease than to those observed for SQV, LPV and RTV. ADME (for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) parameters estimation for new drugs, significantly helps to reduce the pharmacokinetics-related failure in clinical phases. These results evidence that these compounds could be suitable for further medicinal chemistry optimization to produce the second generation of inhibitors more specific and potent against SARS-CoV-2.Other antivirals have been evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 as the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, a nucleotide analog (currently in clinical trials against Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2), alone or in combination with chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosome acidification, with interesting results (Wang et al., 2020; de Wit et al., 2020) . Therefore, proposing a combinatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2 could be a feasible approach. The starting therapeutic scheme could include remdesivir, with the disadvantage of its intravenous administration, and HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as Lopinavir or Saquinavir. Nevertheless, more pre-clinical and clinical data are required to support the development of new therapies against SARS-CoV-2. "
5o9bbspc,Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial,"In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID- 19) due to a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in China and outside [1, 2] . The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 12 th 2020 [3] . According to a recent Chinese stud, about 80% of patients present with mild disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 79 years and 14.8% in those aged >80 years [4] . However, there is probably an important number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of March 14 th 2020 [5] . Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the transmission in the community. Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of old drugs for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [6, 7] .A recent paper reported an inhibitor effect of remdesivir (a new antiviral drug) and chloroquine (an old antimalarial drug) on the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, [8] and an early clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients, showed that chloroquine had a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance, when comparing to controls groups [9, 10] . Chinese experts recommend that patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine, be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten days [11] .Hydroxychloroquine (an analogue of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [12] . Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose [13] and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions [14] . Our team has a very comprehensive experience in successfully treating patients with chronic diseases due to intracellular bacteria (Q fever due to Coxiella burnetii and Whipple's disease due to Tropheryma whipplei) with long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment (600 mg/day for 12 to 18 months) since more than 20 years. [15, 16] We therefore started to conduct a clinical trial aiming at assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients after approval by the French Ministry of Health. In this report we describe our early results, focusing on virological data in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group.This ongoing study is coordinated by The Méditerranée Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille. Patients who were proposed a treatment with hydroxychloroquine were recruited and managed in Marseille centre. Controls without hydroxychloroquine treatment were recruited in Marseille, Nice, Avignon and Briançon centers, all located in South France.Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study if they fulfilled two primary criteria: i) age >12 years; ii) PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 carriage in nasopharyngeal sample at admission whatever their clinical status.Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including retinopathy, G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation. Breastfeeding and pregnant patients were excluded based on their declaration and pregnancy test results when required.Before being included in the study, patients meeting inclusion criteria had to give their consent to participate to the study. Written informed signed consent was obtained from adult participants (> 18 years) or from parents or legal guardians for minors (<18 years). An information document that clearly indicates the risks and the benefits associated with the participation to the study was given to each patient. Patients received information about their clinical status during care regardless of whether they participate in the study or not. Regarding patient identification, a study number was assigned sequentially to included participants, according to the range of patient numbers allocated to each study centre. The study was Patients were seen at baseline for enrolment, initial data collection and treatment at day-0, and again for daily follow-up during 14 days. Each day, patients received a standardized clinical examination and when possible, a nasopharyngeal sample was collected. All clinical data were collected using standardized questionnaires. All patients in Marseille center were proposed oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days (in this preliminary phase ,we did not enrolled children in the treatment group based in data indicating that children develop mild symptoms of COVID-19 [4] ). Patients who refused the treatment or had an exclusion criteria, served as controls in Marseille centre. Patients in other centers did not receive hydroxychloroquine and served as controls. Symptomatic treatment and antibiotics as a measure to prevent bacterial super-infection was provided by investigators based on clinical judgment. Hydroxychloroquine was provided by the National Pharmacy of France on nominative demand.Patients were grouped into three categories: asymptomatic, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) when presenting with rhinitis, pharyngitis, or isolated low-grade fever and myalgia, and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) when presenting with symptoms of pneumonia or bronchitis.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR [17] .Native hydroxychloroquine has been dosed from patients' serum samples by UHPLC-UV using a previously described protocol [18] . The peak of the chromatogram at 1.05 min of retention corresponds to hydroxychloroquine metabolite. The serum concentration of this metabolite is deduced from UV absorption, as for hydroxychloroquine concentration.Considering both concentrations provides an estimation of initial serum hydroxychloroquine concentration.For all patients, 500 µL of the liquid collected from the nasopharyngeal swab were passed through 0.22-µm pore sized centrifugal filter (Merck millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), then were inoculated in wells of 96-well culture microplates, of which 4 wells contained Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) in Minimum Essential Medium culture medium with 4% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. After centrifigation at 4,000 g, microplates were incubated at 37°C.Plates were observed daily for evidence of cytopathogenic effect. Presumptive detection of virus in supernatant was done using SU5000 SEM (Hitachi) then confirmed by specific RT-PCR.The primary endpoint was virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion. Secondary outcomes were virological clearance overtime during the study period, clinical follow-up (body temperature, respiratory rate, long of stay at hospital and mortality), and occurrence of sideeffects.Assuming a 50% efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load at day 7, a 85% power, a type I error rate of 5% and 10% loss to follow-up, we calculated that a total of 48 We enrolled 36 out of 42 patients meeting the inclusion criteria in this study that had at least followed by 250mg per day, the next four days) to prevent bacterial super-infection under daily electrocardiogram control. Clinical follow-up and occurrence of side-effects will be described in a further paper at the end of the trial.Mean hydroxychloroquine serum concentration was 0.46 µg/ml+0.2 (N=20).The proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples significantly differed between treated patients and controls at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion (Table 2 ). At day6 post-inclusion, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologicaly cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group (p= 0.001).When comparing the effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment as a single drug and the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromyc in combination, the proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples was significantly different between the two groups at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion (Table 3) We could isolate SARS-CoV-2 in 19 out of 25 clinical samples from patients.For ethical reasons and because our first results are so significant and evident we decide to share our findings with the medical community, given the urgent need for an effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic context.We show here that hydroxychloroquine is efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days, in most patients. A significant difference was observed between hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and controls starting even on day3 post-inclusion. These results are of great importance because a recent paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-19 in China was 20 days (even 37 days for the longest duration) [19] Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72%µM) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%µM) [14] . These in vitro results corroborate our clinical results. The target values indicated in this paper [14] were reached in our experiments. The safer dose-dependent toxicity profile of hydroxychloroquine in humans, compared to that of chloroquine [13] allows using clinical doses of hydroxychloroquine that will be over its EC50 observed in vitro [14] .Our preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Azithromycin has been shown to be active in vitro against Zika and Ebola viruses [20] [21] [22] and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when administrated to patients suffering viral infection [23] . This finding should be further explored to know whether a combination is more effective especially in severe cases. Speculated potential risk of severe QT prolongation induced by the association of the two drugs has not been established yet but should be considered. As for each treatment, the cost benefits of the risk should be evaluated individually. Further studies on this combination are needed, since such combination may both act as an antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent bacterial super-infections.The cause of failure for hydroxychloroquine treatment should be investigated by testing the isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains of the non-respondents and analyzing their genome, and by analyzing the host factors that may be associated with the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine.The existence of hydroxychloroquine failure in two patients (mother and son) is more suggestive of the last mechanism of resistance. including vaccine development could be also effective, but only in the future. We therefore recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world. Further works are also warranted to determine if these compounds could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus, especially for healthcare workers. Our study has some limitations including a small sample size, limited long-term outcome follow-up, and dropout of six patients from the study, however in the current context, we believe that our results should be shared with the scientific community. a control patients from centers other than Marseille did not underwent daily sampling, but were sampled every other day in most cases, they were considered positive for PCR when actually positive the day(s) before and the day(s) after the day(s) with missing data.

qczuydvb,COVID-19 Illness in Native and Immunosuppressed States: A Clinical-Therapeutic Staging Proposal,"systems and their clinicians adopt a universal consolidated framework to recognize the staged progression of COVID-19 illness in order to deploy and investigate targeted therapy likely to save lives. The largest report of COVID-19 from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention summarized findings from 72, 314 cases and noted that while 81% were of a mild nature with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%, a small subgroup of 5% presented with respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction resulting in fatality in half of such cases, a finding that suggests that it is within this group that the opportunity for life saving measures may be most pertinent. 1 Once the disease is manifest, supportive measures are initiated with quarantines; however a systematic disease modifying therapeutic approach remains empirical.Pharmacotherapy targeted against the virus holds the greatest promise when applied early in the course of the illness, but its usefulness in advanced stages may be doubtful. 2, 3 Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory therapy applied too early may not be necessary and could even provoke viral replication such as in the case of corticosteroids. 4 It appears that there are two distinct but overlapping pathological subsets, the first triggered by the virus itself and the second, the host response. Whether in native state, immunoquiescent state as in the elderly, or immunosuppressed state as in heart transplantation, the disease tends to present and follow these two phases, albeit in different levels of severity. The early reports in heart transplantation suggest that symptom expression during the phase of establishment of infection are similar to non-immunosuppressed individuals; however, in limited series the second wave determined by the host-inflammatory response appears to be milder, possibly due to the concomitant use of immuno-modulatory drugs. 5, 6 Similarly, an epidemiological study from Wuhan in a cohort of 87 patients suggests that precautionary measures of social distancing, sanitization and general hygiene allow heart transplant recipients to experience a low rate of COVID-19 illness. 7 We do not of course, know if they are asymptomatic carriers, since in this survey-based study universal testing during the early 3 months was not employed. One interesting fact in this study was that many heart transplant recipients have hematological changes of lymphopenia due to the effects of immunosuppressive therapy which may obfuscate the laboratory interpretation of infection in such patients should they get infected.Much confusion abounds in the therapeutic tactics employed in COVID-19. It is imperative that a structured approach to clinical phenotyping be undertaken to distinguish the phase where the viral pathogenicity is dominant versus when the host inflammatory response overtakes the pathology. In this editorial we propose a clinical staging system to establish a standardized nomenclature for uniform evaluation and reporting of this disease, to facilitate therapeutic application and evaluate response. We propose the use of a 3-stage classification system, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibits three grades of increasing severity which correspond with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical outcome (Figure) .The initial stage occurs at the time of inoculation and early establishment of disease. For most people, this involves an incubation period associated with mild and often non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fever and a dry cough. During this period, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies and establishes residence in the host, primarily focusing on the respiratory system. Similar to its older relative, SARS-CoV (responsible for the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak), SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. 8 These receptors are abundantly present on human lung and small intestine epithelium, as well as the vascular endothelium. As a result of the airborne method of transmission as well as affinity for pulmonary ACE2 receptors, the infection usually presents with mild respiratory and systemic symptoms. Diagnosis at this stage includes respiratory sample PCR, serum testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, along with chest imaging, complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests. CBC may reveal a lymphopenia and neutrophilia without other significant abnormalities. Treatment at this stage is primarily targeted towards symptomatic relief.Should a viable anti-viral therapy (such as remdesivir) be proven beneficial, targeting selected patients during this stage may reduce duration of symptoms, minimize contagiousness and prevent progression of severity. In patients who can keep the virus limited to this stage of COVID-19, prognosis and recovery is excellent.Stage II (moderate) -Pulmonary Involvement (IIa) without and (IIb) with hypoxia:In the second stage of established pulmonary disease, viral multiplication and localized inflammation in the lung is the norm. During this stage, patients develop a viral pneumonia, with cough, fever and possibly hypoxia (defined as a PaO 2 /FiO 2 of <300 mmHg). Imaging with chest roentgenogram or computerized tomography reveals bilateral infiltrates or ground glass opacities. Blood tests reveal increasing lymphopenia, along with transaminitis. Markers of systemic inflammation may be elevated, but not remarkably so. It is at this stage that most patients with COVID-19 would need to be hospitalized for close observation and management.Treatment would primarily consist of supportive measures and available anti-viral therapies such as remdesivir (available under compassionate and trial use). It should be noted that serum procalcitonin is low to normal in most cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. In early stage II (without significant hypoxia), the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 may be avoided. 4 However, if hypoxia ensues, it is likely that patients will progress to requiring mechanical ventilation and in that situation, we believe that use of anti-inflammatory therapy such as with corticosteroids may be useful and can be judiciously employed. Thus, Stage II disease should be subdivided into Stage IIa (without hypoxia) and Stage IIb (with hypoxia).A minority of COVID-19 patients will transition into the third and most severe stage of illness, which manifests as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. In this stage, markers of systemic inflammation appear to be elevated. COVID-19 infection results in a decrease in helper, suppressor and regulatory T cell counts. 9 Studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, Creactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer are significantly elevated in those patients with more severe disease. 10 Troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can also be elevated. A form akin to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) may occur in patients in this advanced stage of disease. 11 In this stage, shock, vasoplegia, respiratory failure and even cardiopulmonary collapse are discernable. Systemic organ involvement, even myocarditis, would manifest during this stage. Tailored therapy in stage III hinges on the use of immunomodulatory agents to reduce systemic inflammation before it overwhelmingly results in multi-organ dysfunction. In this phase, use of corticosteroids may be justified in concert with the use of cytokine inhibitors such as tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist). 11 Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a role in modulating an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and rapid recognition and deployment of such therapy may have the greatest yield.The first open-label randomized controlled clinical trial of antiviral therapy was recently reported. 3 In this study, 199 patients were randomly allocated to the antiviral agents lopinavir-ritonavir or to standard of care and this regimen was not found to be particularly effective. One reason for this may have been that the patients were enrolled during the pulmonary stage with hypoxia (stage IIb) when the viral pathogenicity may have been only one lesser dominant aspect of the overall pathophysiology, and host inflammatory responses were the predominant pathophysiology We believe that this proposed 3-stage classification system for COVID-19 illness will serve to develop a uniform scaffold to build structured therapeutic experience as healthcare systems globally are besieged by this crisis, in patients with or without transplantation.

1u12qr97,Advance of promising targets and agents against 2019-nCoV in China,"Early December 2019, and an epidemic pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus infection (later named as COVID-19 by WHO) was recorded in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China; the viral infection was soon to spread widely across China. As of 28 Feb 2020, 78 959 cases have been confirmed including 1500 healthcare workers and there have been over 2791 deaths with an estimated mortality rate of ~ 2% in China; this compares with mortality rates of 10% for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and 37% for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). More urgently, this novel coronavirus is spreading across the globe and has affected >46 countries with 3664 cases confirmed outside China and 57 related deaths recorded. Particularly, the abruptness and speed of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, Iran, Korea and Italy in late February 2020, indicating that a global catastrophe is unfolding [1] , is of great concern.Viruses of the coronaviridae family possess a single-strand, positive-sense RNA and have been identified in various avian hosts and mammals, seven of which could cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. COVID-19, a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified, is similar to the coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV with >79% sequence identity; but it is more distant from MERS-CoV (only 50% homology) [2] . For all coronaviruses including COVID-19, at least three structural proteins are shared on the membrane: spike (S), the membrane protein (M) and small membrane protein (E). Also, another four functional proteins were found in almost all coronaviruses: 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. During the viral infection process, including intracellular transport of virions, proliferation and assembling of virions in the infected cellnot only structural and functional proteins but also some proteasesplay a key part, suggesting that targeting these proteins or enzymes as a therapy against COVID-19 infection could be a promising strategy. To date, no special drugs or vaccines have been used to deal with human coronaviruses. Considering the seriousness and suddenness of the COVID-19 outbreak, ~200 clinical trials on COVID-19 have commenced in China, and it is promising to report that certain targets and their agents have displayed strong antiviral potential, of which some have been permitted to be used in an attempt to combat the disease in clinical trials.Remdesivir and favipiravir interfere with the synthesis of viral mRNA targeting RdRp. Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of COVID-19 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit COVID-19 strongly with an EC50 ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 μM [3] . Remdesivir cured the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2′-5′oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death. Thus, special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications.however, the mechanism is unclear and existing theories cannot explain this phenomenon. Moreover, basic research efforts should be devoted to the molecular mechanisms and separation and/or purification. Another disturbing fact is that some unreasonable clinical trial schemes are consuming precious patient resources; and some others have not even been approved by an ethics committee. Clinical trials must be undertaken actively, carefully and scientifically reflecting the basic principles of the Helsinki Declaration and its relevant laws and regulations. Despite the urgency generated by the emergence of a new coronavirus, the researchers should maintain rigorous evidence and follow the guidelines for clinical trial statistics and the basic principles including randomization, control and repetition. 'First, do no harm' should still be the top priority."
1vm5r7pq,The use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of people with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): The experience of clinical immunologists from China,"Since the sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Wu Han City, Ch ina caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Co V-2), in just two more months, the epidemic has rapidly spread all over the world. On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organizat ion (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Till March 22, globally, appro ximately 303,000 confirmed cases, including mo re than 12,900 deaths in approximately 150 countries. Data fro m China have indicated that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk of death than younger ones. A minority of patients presented with respiratory failure, septic shock and mult i-organ dysfunction resulting in a fatality of 4%.In the past two month, we took part in a serial of remote teleconsultation, discussing several critical ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and clin ical pathological conference (CPC).Here, fro m the perspective of clin ical immunologist and rheu matologists, we would like to d iscuss and share our experience in the treatment of severe COVID-19.Fro m the point of v iew of rheu matologists, e xcept for respiratory failure, the crit ical ill COVID-19 patients have common features: 1) sudden deterioration of disease around one to two weeks after onset;2) much lower level of ly mphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood; 3) extremely high infla mmatory parameters, includ ing C reactive p rotein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-8, et al); 4) destroyed immune system revealed by atrophy of spleen and ly mph nodes, along with reduced ly mphocytes in ly mphoid organs; 5) the majority of infiltrated immune cells in lung lesion are monocytes and macrophages , but minimal ly mphocytes infilt ration; 6) mimicry of vasculitis, hypercoagulability and multiple organs damage.Based on the above characteristics of COVID-19, we discuss the follo wing points in terms of treatment.Cytokine storm (CS) refers to excessive and uncontrolled release of pro -inflammatory cytokines.Cytokine storm syndrome can be caused by a variety of diseases, including infectious diseases, rheumatic diseases and tumor immunotherapy. Clin ically, it co mmonly presents as systemic inflammation, multiple organ failure, and high inflammatory parameters.In infect ious diseases, CS usually originates fro m the focal infected area, spreading all over the body through circu lation. In coronavirus pneumonia, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) andMiddle East respiratory syndrome (M ERS), acco mpanied by rapid virus replication, a large number of inflammatory cell infiltrat ion and CS led to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death [1, 2] . Accumu lating evidence revealed that a part of severe COVID-19 patients [3, 4] . Notably, there was not pronounce difference of seru m IL-6 level been the ICU and non ICU patients. However, in another ret rospective, mu lticentre cohort study, the same study group reported a significantly elevation of IL-6 level in non-survival group of patients with COVID-19, as compared with that of the survivals [5] . Several other reports also confirmed the elevation of IL-6 in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] .In severe COVID-19, although patients have lymphcytopenia, the ly mphocytes were activated.One study analyzed the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients, all patients had ly mphcytopenia, The percentage of CD8 + T cell reduction were 28.43% and 61.9% in mild and severe group respectively, and the NK cell reduction were 34.31% and 47.62% respectively ，in mild and severe groups. Also, serum IL-6 levels in severe group were significantly higher than that in mild group [9] . In addition, the expression of HLA-DR in CD4 + and CD8 + cells was increased, CD4 + CCR4 + CCR6 + Th17 cells also increased, and the cytotoxic particles such as perforin and granolysin were highly expressed in CD8 + T cells [10] .Consistent with others, most of severe COVID-19 patients in our ICU ward had persistent very high level of erythematosus sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, and h igh level of IL-6,TNF, IL-1, IL-8, IL2R, etc, and were associated with ARDS, hypercoagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), manifested as thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, gangrene of extremit ies. It is possible that CS exacerbates lung damage as well as lead to other fetal complications. Siddiqu and Mehra [11] proposed a 3-stage classification model, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibited three g rades of increasing severity which corresponded with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical outcome. A small proportion of COVID-19 patients would transit into the third and most severe stage of illness, which manifested as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. In this stage, markers of systemic inflammation appeared to be ext remely elevated. Therefore, how to b lock the CS and when to initiate anti-inflammation therapy is critical for reducing death rate of COVID-19.Ly mphocytopenia is one of the most pro minent markers of COVID-19, it's also one of the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 in China [12] . Both T cells and NK cells in patients with COVID-19 were reduced. The degree of reduction was even lower in severe cases the latter had higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-ly mphocyte-ratio (NLR) as well. In some critical ill patients, NK cells were extremely low, or even undetectable. In addit ion, memo ry helper T cells and regulatory T cells were obviously decreased in severe cases [13] .More strikingly, the autopsy findings revealed that the secondary lymphoid tissues had been destroyed in COVID-19 patients, which is very unusual fro m other CS related diseases. Spleen atrophy was observed in all reported cases with decreased numbers of lymphocyte, and significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, macrophage proliferation and macrophage phagocytosis were found in spleen. Similarly, lymph node atrophy and the number of lymph nodes decreased, accompanied by necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells were decreased in spleen and lymph nodes [13] . In addition, in the lung with characteristic diffused alveolar damage (DAD), the major infiltrated cells were monocytes and macrophages, moderate multinucleated giant cells, but very few lymphocytes. Most of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof infiltrating lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Importantly, virus inc lusion bodies can still be detected in type II alveolar epithelia and macrophages, despite that the PCR test was negative in blood or throat swabs [10, 12, 14] . This finding is consistent with the characteristics of the so called ""primary cytokine"" storm induced by viral infect ion wh ich were mainly produced by alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells and endothelial cells, rather than those observed in ""secondary cytokine"" storm induced by different subsets of activated T ly mphocytes in late stage of v iral infect ion or a complication of T cell-engaging therapies [15 16].There are two possible reasons for the destruction of the immune system in patients with COVID-19, ly mphocytes directly invaded by virus or indirect ly damaged by CS . As we know that 2019-n Co V infects target cells through ACE2, while there was no ACE2 expression on lymphocytes, we speculate that lymphocytes were probably destroyed by CS.Another prominent clinical man ifestation in severe COVID-19 patients is endothelium damage.Mimicry of vasculitis could be seen in severe COVID-19 patients. Clinically, many crit ical ill patients have vasculitis-like man ifestations, or even gangrene at their ext remities; Pathology examination revealed the blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested and edematous, with modest infiltrat ion of monocytes and lymphocytes within and around blood vessels. Small vessels showed hyperplasia, vessel wall thicken ing, lu men stenosis , occlusion and focal hemorrhage. Hyaline thromb i of micro -vessels were found in a proportion of severe cases [10, 13, 14] . Intriguingly, some patients were tested positive with high titer antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticardio lip in antibodies and anti-2 g lycoprotein antibodies, and were associated with severe thrombosis (unpublished data). The underlying mechanism of vascular damage may be due to the direct injury of endothelial cells by virus, leading to DIC, anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and mimicry of vasculitis. The pathological autoimmune responses involved in the anti-virus immunity are worth to be emphasized. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a ro le in modulat ing an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and prompt recognition and application of such therapy may have the greatest yield [11, 17] .However, there is dilemma of anti-inflammatory therapy, balancing the risk and benefit ratio is a critical issue. Should we apply anti-inflammat ion therapy to COVID-19 patients? Which patient should we treat with anti-inflammat ion regimen, and when to start? What is the treatment duration? Which med ication is the best choice? All the above questions are still under intense debate and do not reach a consensus. The main concern is that anti-inflammatory medicat ions, such as corticosteroid, may delay the elimination of virus and increase the risk of secondary infection, especially in those with impaired immune system. Secondly, bio logical agents targeting on pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factor, and thus may not be very effective in curbing the CS in COVID-19 in which other cytokines maybe of significant importance. Thirdly, some anti-in flammation medicat ion such as JAK inhibitors also block INF-a production, which is important in fighting virus, and theoretically may not be suitable for the treatment of inflammatory CS caused by virus as COVID-19.Finally, the time window of anti-inflammatory treat ment is very important. According to reports and our observation, severe patients usually underwent abrupt deterioration in 1~2 weeks after onset, and prompt init iation of the anti-in flammatory therapy at this extremely short time window is likely to achieve a favorable treatment response.Nu merous clinical studies have reported the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the trea tment of coronavirus pneumonia (such as SARS and MERS) o r influen za pneumonia, but no consensus has been reached. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, g lucocorticoid was the main medication of immuno modulatory therapy. Timely us age of glucocorticoid could imp rove the early fever, pro mote the absorption of pneumonia and obtain better o xygenation. Ho wever, some studies didn't show beneficial effects with glucocorticoid, or even adverse reactions or delayed virus clearance, leading to deterioration of the disease [18] [19] [20] [21] .According to international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock, if g lucocorticoid is to be used, small dosage and short-term applicat ion should be applied only for patients in whom adequate fluids and vasopressor therapy do not restore hemodynamic stability [22] .At present, systemic glucocorticoids administration was empirically used for severe comp licat ions in order to suppress CS man ifestations in patients with COVID-19, such as ARDS, acute heart in juries, acute kidney complication, and patients with higher D-d imer levels, et al [3, 23, 24] However, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials to support glucocorticoids treatment for COVID-19. Chen et al. reported 19 (19%) patients were treated with glucocorticoids for 3-15 days (median 5 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ), and methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg per day) are reco mmended for patients with ARDS, fo r as short a duration of treatment as possible [25] .The current evidence and our experience indicate that the benefit of the use of glucocorticoids is likely outweighed by adverse effect. Wang et al reported 44.9% patients of COVID-19 were g iven glucocorticoid therapy, with no effective outcomes observed [26] . Russell et al. reported clinical evidence did not support corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 lung inju ry [27] . Due to the lack of evidences, the interim guideline of WHO does not support the use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia and A RDS for suspected COVID -19 cases in 22 February 2020 [28] .Therefore, efficacy and associated adverse effects of glucocorticoids in COVID -19 need further elucidated. The receptors of novel coronavirus pneumonia (2019-n Co V), might be A CE2, wh ich is a cell-surface protein widely existed on cells in the heart, kidney, blood vessels, especially lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells. 2019-n Co V could invade and enter cells through endocytosis. One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). AAK1 inhib itors can interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and can be helpful in preventing virus infect ions. Baricit inib, a JAK inhibitor as well as an AAK1 inhibitor, was suggested a possible candidate for treatment of COVID-19, considering its relative safety and high affinity. Therapeutic dosage with either 2 mg or 4 mg once daily was sufficient to reach the plas ma concentration of inhib ition [29] . Ho wever, as we mentioned above, the biggest concern about JAK inhibitors is that it can inhib it a variety of inflammatory cytokines including INF-a, which plays an important ro le in curbing v irus activity. Previous studies reported that CQ/HCQ possess a broad spectrum of antiv iral effects on a variety of viruses as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [30] , Marburg virus, Zika virus [31], dengue virus [32] , Ebola virus [33] , and SARS-Co V-1 [34, 35] , etc. CQ and HCQ can interfere with the binding of viral particles to their cellular cell surface receptor or the pH-dependent endosome-med iated viral entry of enveloped viruses to inhibit the v iral cycle [32] . They can also interfere with the post-translational modification of viral proteins or impair the proper maturation of viral p rotein by pH modulation [36] . In addition, CQ and HCQ can regulate immune system by affect ing cell signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Although CQ or HCQ are frequently used for the treatment of rheumatic d iseases due to its immuno modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, the benefit in treating COVID -19 may be mainly attributed to its anti-viral effects. Recently, CQ and HCQ have been shown by several studies to reduce the SARS-Co V-2 v iral load and shorten the duration of viremia. Whether their immuno modulatory effect also plays a ro le in the treat ment of COVID -19 still requires further investigation. For coronaviruses, the potential therapeutic benefits of CQ were notably reported for SA RS-Co V-1. In vitro, CQ can prevent SARS-Co V-1 fro m in fecting the glycosylation of a virus cell surface receptor, ACE2 [30] . A very recent publication of results showed that CQ is highly effect ive in the control of COVID-19 infection in vitro [37] . for treat ment of COVID-19 reco mmends chloroquine phosphate is orally ad min istered at a dose of 500 mg (300 mg for chloroquine) for adults, 2 times/ day (no more than 10 days) [39] . The results of this clinical trial confirmed the short -term efficacy of HCQ in the treat ment of COVID-19, wh ich can effectively improve lung imag ing findings, promote a virus -negative conversion, and shorten the disease course. Although the number of cases in HCQ group was relatively small, current data can provide insights for clin icians. The efficacy and safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials.In conclusion, COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease mainly manifested as fever and pneumonia,anti-viral and respiratory supportive therapies are the mainstream of treat ments for severe cases. As CS occurs in critical ill patients, which leads to ARDS and mult iple organ damage, and even death, anti-inflammation treat ment may be applied. Ho wever, given the viral nature of the COVID-19 CS, and considering a substantial impairness of host immune system in severe cases, it is crit ical to balance the risk and benefit rat io before starting anti-inflammat ion therapy. In addition, a timely anti-inflammat ion treatment in itiated at the right window time is of pivotal importance and should be tailored in individual patient to achieve the most favorable effects.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof"
9vrny92m,"COVID-19 infection and rheumatoid arthritis: Faraway, so close!","In December 2019 a new type of pneumonia supported by a novel member of the coronoviridae family named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome) developed from Wuhan Province in China [1] . Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this is a different virus with~80% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-1 [2] . The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by dry cough, fever, dyspnea and fatigue, accompanied by lymphopenia [3] [4] [5] [6] . In more severe cases (apparently up to 15-20% of infected patients) the picture may become more complicated by the onset of interstitial pneumonia with alveolar damage, which clinically can lead to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and even death [7] . Since the initial outbreak, the epidemic has had a rapid global spread worldwide which led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease now called COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th January 2020 and a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The epidemiological picture is constantly evolving, and data updated as of March 17th count 159 countries involved with more than 185,000 cases and 7500 confirmed deaths [8] .In this context of growing health emergency, clarifying the relationship between COVID-19 and the population of fragile patients suffering from immune-rheumatological diseases is absolutely crucial. On the one hand, the rapid and uncontrolled spread of the epidemic can clearly generate even more concerns in rheumatic patients, which are intrinsically characterized by an increased infectious risk due to the disease itself and to the iatrogenic effect of immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids and synthetic or biological disease-modifying drugs [9] . On the other hand, the growing knowledge about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to the introduction of drugs commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) even for the management of more complex cases of COVID-19. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have now been permanently included, alongside antiviral drugs, in protocols for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [10] . In addition, the use of interleukin 6 (IL-6) blockers seems to be very promising for the management of the massive cytokine storm associated to the development of the typical lung damage and the consequent ARDS occurring in the most aggressive patterns of SARS-CoV infection [11] .Therefore, waiting for observational data on the incidence of COVID-19 in rheumatological patients, the best strategy to manage immune-rheumatological diseases during this emergency period is still far to be clear. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview on viral infectious risk in RA patients, with a particular focus on the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102523 Received 7 March 2020; Accepted 19 March 2020 knowledge about the current new pandemic and the use of anti-rheumatic drugs in this context of health emergency.Coronaviruses are the largest viruses with a positive-sense singlestranded-RNA genome. The host immune response is by one side essential for the resolution of COVID-19 infection, but it can also be crucial for the pathogenesis of major clinical manifestations of the disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the host cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV2 envelope spike glycoprotein [12] . ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed on cells in the kidney, heart, gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and, importantly, lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells, which are particularly prone to viral infection [13] . SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the downregulation of ACE2 expression, thus resulting in excessive production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE. It has been suggested that the stimulation of type 1a angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1A) increases pulmonary vascular permeability, thus potentially explaining the increased lung damage when the expression of ACE2 is decreased [14] . Due to this mechanism of action, it has been postulated that subjects with diabetes mellitus or hypertension using ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may have an increase of both the risk of infection and the severity of COVID-19 [15] . As only scarce evidence supports this hypothesis, the European Society of Cardiology recently published a position statement that strongly recommends continuing these treatments despite the current epidemic [16] . An additional point to be clarified is also the role of the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebral stroke, especially in Asian populations [15] .The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm, and the RNA is uncoated to allow translation of the two polyproteins, transcription of the sub-genomic RNAs and replication of the viral genome [17] . Progression to ARDS is associated with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known as Cytokines Release Syndrome (CRS), with a pattern very similar to that of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). In adults, sHLH is an under-recognized, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a massive and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure, most commonly triggered by viral infections [18, 19] . Main clinical features of sHLH include unremitting fever, hyperferritinaemia and cytopenias, and pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurring in approximately 50% of patients [20] . A cytokine profile resembling sHLH has been reported in most severe COVID-19 infections, characterized by increased levels of a number of cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β], IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF]) and chemokines (CXCchemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10] and CC-chemokine ligand 2 [CCL2]) [21, 22] . The management of this cytokine storm is one of the major unmet needs regarding COVID-19 infection.The relationship between RA and infectious diseases is very complex and can be interpreted in two different directions. On the one hand, in fact, the potential role of external microorganisms in producing acute and chronic arthritis in the form of either the direct colonization of the joints by the pathogen or the aberrant autoimmune reaction produced by the host response to the infection is well known [23, 24] . Few studies have investigated a potential link between respiratory viral infections and the development of RA [25] and in particular a Korean study reported parainfluenza and coronavirus to be associated with the number of incident RA [26] . In addition, in patients with overt inflammatory arthritis, infections are a major concern as they can contribute to disease flares [27] [28] [29] . On the other hand, RA patients carry a documented increased risk of infection compared with the general population. A population-based study by Doran and colleagues compared two matched groups of 609 patients with or without RA showing that RA patients had a significantly higher risk of serious (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.41-1.65) and hospitalized (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.71-2.07) infections [30] . Similarly, a prospective cohort study conducted on 2108 patients with inflammatory polyarthritis reported a 2-to 4-fold increased risk of hospitalized infection compared to healthy population [31] . This trend is primarily the result of a general impairment of the immune system typical of all autoimmune disorders and strictly dependent on the degree of disease activity. In fact, it has been demonstrated by an analysis conducted in 16,242 RA patients from the US CORRONA registry that each 0.6 unit increase in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) corresponded to a 25% increased rate of infections requiring hospitalization (Incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.25, p = .03) and a 4% increased rate of outpatient infections (IRR 1.04, p = .01) [32] . In addition, a subsequent report from the same registry showed that the risk of serious infections increased progressively from patients achieving clinical remission to those achieving low (adjusted IRR 1.69, 95% CI 1.32-2.15) or moderate (adjusted IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.56) disease activity, demonstrating the importance of maintaining a good disease control in order to reduce infectious complications [33] .Another important determinant of infectious risk is the presence of comorbidities, which very often complicate the course of RA [34] . Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, renal failure, interstitial lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all concomitant disorders associated with an increased incidence of infections in RA [27, 35] .Finally, RA can also be complicated by infections caused by the iatrogenic effect of immunosuppressive therapies, which will be discussed in detail in the next section.It has now been more than 70 years that corticosteroids (CS) are pivotal for RA management and their role as remission inducer and bridging therapy for the management of disease flare has recently been renewed by the latest update of EULAR recommendations for RA treatment [36] . Even though CS efficacy in rapidly suppressing inflammation during RA initial course or flares is well recognized [37] , their downside is the broad spectrum of adverse events, including severe infections and the high risk of developing comorbidities further increasing the risk of infection [27, 38] . Although RCTs conducted in the past with CS showed no higher risk of infections in RA patients [39] [40] [41] , cohort and case-control studies reported increased rates of overall infections in RA patients treated with CS, according to a dosedependent fashion [42] . The majority of these infectious events are of bacterial etiology, but RA patients receiving CS exhibit a greater risk of developing even viral infections. As an example, a 2012 retrospective cohort-study demonstrated an increased risk of Herpes Zoster infections with an incidence rate of 8.54 cases per 1000 patient-years in CS treated population [29] .Thus, CS on the one hand inhibit the immune response and delay the clearance of the pathogen, while on the other hand they suppress the host inflammatory response, which in the case of viral infections of the respiratory tract is the major responsible for lung damage and occurrence of ARDS [43] . The latter represented the rational for the widely use of CS for the management of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV [44] and SARS-CoV [45] outbreaks, both histologically characterized by lung inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage [46] . However, evidence from the literature points to a predominantly negative effect of CS in the management of this type of infection. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis including ten observational studies (n = 6548) conducted in influenza reported increased mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.3-2.4; p = .0002), increased rate of secondary bacterial or fungal infection (RR 2·0, 95% CI 1·0-3·8; p = .04), and longer stay in an intensive care unit (mean difference 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.1; p < .0001) in patients receiving CS [47] . Moreover, a review exploring treatments for ARDS, including six studies with a total of 574 patients, concluded that insufficient evidence exists to recommend CS treatment [48] . Overall, no clear reason exists to expect that patients with COVID-19 infection will benefit from CS, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such therapy [49] . In fact, current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of COVID-19 infection advises against the use of CS unless indicated for another reason [10] .The role of NSAIDs in the course of viral infections is still controversial. Ibuprofen has been demonstrated to induce an overexpression of ACE2 when used in diabetic rats [50] and this effect might theoretically increase the susceptibility and worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in treated patients [15] . In addition, the use of both NSAIDs and acetaminophen could be associated with a masking of the fever rise during COVID-19, resulting in a delay in diagnosis and proper management of the infection.The most comprehensive analysis of infectious risk in patients treated with csDMARDs is a retrospective, longitudinal study of a population-based RA cohort using an administrative database including a total of 27,710 individuals with RA and providing 162,710 person-years of follow-up [51] . Use of csDMARDs without corticosteroids was associated with a small decrease in mild infection risk ( [52] . A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature confirmed the lack of an increased risk of infection in patients receiving MTX (RR: 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98-1.34) [53] . However, all these reports provided no data on the risk of stratified infection by pathogen.The risk of infection observed in RA patients treated with bDMARDs is generally considered slightly higher (from 1.5-up to 2-fold) compared with csDMARDs [27, 54] . This evidence recurred in most RCTs [55] and observational registry studies [56] [57] [58] and was confirmed by a recent meta-analysis which showed that this risk is progressively increasing in relation to the use of bDMARDs at higher than recommended dosages [59] . Following the results of comparative metanalyses and real-life studies, abatacept is accepted as the safest bDMARD in terms of infectious risk [60, 61] .Data focused on viral respiratory infections in bDMARD cohort are still very limited. The incidence of influenza-like infections observed in a cohort of 159 Italian patients treated with bDMARDs during the influenza season 2009-2010 was higher than the value reported in a wide sample of Italian population in the same period, even though no important complications or hospitalizations have been reported [62] . Overall, post-marketing experience is relatively reassuring that anti-TNF treated patients may not be at any specifically increased risk of influenza and that severe adverse outcomes, including death, do not appear to be exceedingly frequent [63] .The overall risk of serious and opportunistic infections observed with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors in RA patients is roughly comparable with bDMARDs [64, 65] , although these early years of tofacitinib and baricitinib use have raised the issue of an increased risk of Herpes Zoster virus (HZV) infections [66] . Data from tofacitinib pooled population enrolled in RCTs showed an HZV incidence rate of 4.0 per 100 patient-years (with greater incidence in geographic area with high HZV endemicity), doubling the rates of RA patients not receiving JAKis [67] . A similar picture has also been observed in the overall development program of baricitinib, with an incidence rate of 3.2 cases per patient-years [68] . The subsequent real-life experience from US claim databases revealed that the risk of HZV was higher in patients receiving tofacitinib compared to those treated with abatacept (aHR 2.01 (95% CI 1.40; 2.88) [69] , and the risk of serious hospitalized HZV infection is 2fold higher versus all bDMARDs [70] . Older age, female sex, prednisone > 7.5 mg/day, prior infection, and greater number of hospitalizations were associated with increased HZV risk, whereas vaccination was associated with a lower risk [71] . More recent reports from RCTs conducted with novel JAK-1 selective inhibitors upadacitinib and filgotinib have basically confirmed the same trend, suggesting that the increase in HZV infections can be considered as a class effect of JAKis [72, 73] . Although the exact mechanism by which HZV reactivation occurs in the context of JAK inhibition is unclear, the downregulation of both cell-mediated immunity and innate antiviral signaling through type I and II interferons (IFN) is likely to be involved [74] .Currently, no data are available on the risk of respiratory virus infections carried by JAK inhibitors.Currently, vaccines and approved targeted therapeutics for the treatment of the new SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking and the management of COVID-19 is only supportive, even though a multitude of compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this emerging disease [75] . The need to urgently identify an effective approach to manage COVID-19 led to the strategy of testing the efficacy of the existing antiviral drugs commonly used for other viral infections. In particular, considering the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other Betacoronavirus associated with previous epidemics as SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov, the same drugs used with controversial results for these conditions (interferon, ribavirin, and lopinavir-ritonavir) have been considered even for COVID-19 [76] . Anecdotal cases have demonstrated the ability of lopinavir-ritonavir to significantly reduce viral load and improve disease outcome [77] . In addition, remdesivir, an adenosine analogue currently under development for the management of Ebola virus infection [78] , has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral therapy against a wide spectrum of RNA viruses [79] and showed good preliminary in vitro results in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection [80] . Consequently, lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesevir are currently the only anti-viral drugs included in the more severe case management protocols of COVID-19 [10] . Recent reports described the potential role of human monoclonal antibodies that bind the coronavirus spike receptor binding domain, leading to the neutralization of SARS-CoV2 capability to interact with human target cells [81, 82] . However, at the moment these can only be considered as potential treatment options for the future, but they are obviously not available for the management of the current pandemic.Beyond the use of specific anti-viral products, many drugs commonly used in the treatment of RA have been proposed as possible therapies for COVID-19 as a consequence of the increased knowledge about the pathophysiology of the infection (Table 1) .Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used anti-malarial drugs with well-known immunomodulatory properties that have extended their use to several immuno-rheumatological diseases including RA [83] . The ability of chloroquine to produce an anti-viral effect has been known since the late 1960s [84] . Several mechanisms by which the drug is able to interfere with the growth and spread of different viruses (including SARS coronavirus) have been demonstrated in in vitro studies [85] , even though the subsequent in vivo experience was controversial [86, 87] .At clinically admissible concentrations chloroquine is able to increase the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, to inhibit the toll-like receptor activity, and to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ACE 2 [88] [89] [90] . All these functions may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding, resulting in a potential effect of the drug on both entry and post-entry stages of the SARS CoV infection. As a consequence, chloroquine has recently been included in at least 10 randomized controlled trials currently ongoing in China, where it is tested for the treatment of COVID-19 under various combination protocols with the anti-viral drugs mentioned above [91] . Interim results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine is superior to the control treatment in improving lung imaging findings, inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course at different levels of severity [92] . More recently, hydroxychloroquine was demonstrated to be more 3-times more potent than chloroquine in an in vitro study based on pharmacokinetic models (PBPK). An oral loading dose of 400 mg twice daily, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days seems to be the best option for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection [93] .As already described, ARDS occurring in most severe case of COVID-19 infection is mainly produced by the massive release of pro-inflammatory mediators (CRS) associated with viral replication and lung injury, leading to multiorgan failure [22] . Moreover, the high levels of these cytokines have been reported to be inversely related to the absolute lymphocytes count, with surviving T-cells functionally exhausted [94] . Since an effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells, CRS might be associated with a decreased viral clearance, contributing to COVID-19 worsening. IL-6 and IL-1 play a pivotal role in this hyperinflammatory condition, suggesting the potential use of their blockers as treatment option for SARS-CoV2 related interstitial pneumonia. Data from a phase 3 RCT of IL-1 blockade (anakinra) in sepsis showed significant survival benefit in patients with hyperinflammation, without increased adverse events [95] . A small retrospective study on 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 demonstrated that tocilizumab improved CT scan abnormalities and oxygen saturation, and normalized CRP levels and lymphocytes count in most of the patients [96] . A multicentre RCT of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker licensed for both RA and cytokine release syndrome) has been approved in China and is currently ongoing in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 levels (ChiCTR2000029765) and a phase II study has been approved by the Italian Regulatory Drug Agency (AIFA) and will enrol 330 patients with pneumonia and early respiratory failure, with 1-month mortality reduction as primary outcome (TOCIVID-19) . Moreover, the company that produces the second marketed IL-6 inhibitor sarilumab recently announced its intention to undertake a study with a similar design [97] .The identification of a unique definition of CRS during COVID-19 infection is crucial to better customize the management of critical patients. The presence of a large area of lung injury (≥50%) with decreased levels of CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes (lower than 50% of minimum normal range), and increased levels of IL-6 in peripheral blood have been recognized as the greatest risk factors of CRS in a retrospective analysis of 11 critically pneumonia Chinese patients infected with COVID-19 [98] . Increasing ferritin level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or decreasing platelet counts would be additional parameters potentially useful to discriminate patients requiring immunosuppressive treatment [22] .As previously described, SARS-CoV infection is associated with a downregulation of ACE2 expression coupled with an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system responsible for lung injury [14] .Moreover, the viral spike protein is able to induce a TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, crucial for the penetration of the virus into the cell [99] . Since this process seems to be strictly coupled to TNFα production, it has been postulated that the use of TNF inhibitors may be effective in reducing both SARS-CoV2 infection and the consequent organ damage [100] . As a result, a study evaluating adalimumab in COVID-19 infection has recently been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000030089).As previously described in detail, SARS-CoV-2 enters targeted cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis [12] . Some of the identified regulators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are members of the numbassociated kinase (NAK) family, such as AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) [101] . Inhibition of AAK1 may stop the access of the virus into lung cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles [102] . Of 47 AAK1 blockers approved for [103] . Unfortunately, all these compounds are able to produce adequate NAK inhibition only at doses significantly higher than those normally used in clinical practice and therefore potentially toxic for the patient [104, 105] . Conversely, the JAK inhibitor baricitinib is able to effectively inhibit AAK1 and GAK at the plasma concentration obtained with the approved dosage for the treatment of RA (2 to 4 mg daily) [106] . Moreover, as a selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2, baricitinib is also able to produce an important dampening of host inflammatory response due to CRS (including IL-6 and interferon gamma) responsible for the more severe forms of interstitial pneumonia during COVID-19 [107, 108] . Finally, the minimal interaction of baricitinib with the relevant CYP drug-metabolising enzymes makes the drug a possible candidate for inclusion in combination protocols with antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir [109] . Interestingly, tofacitinib shows no detectable inhibition of AAK1 [104] , whereas currently no data are available on the possible effect of other JAK inhibitors approved or tested for RA (such as upadacitinib or filgotinib) in relation to coronavirus infection. Unexpectedly, the only clinical trial evaluating the potential role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis blockade in the management of COVID-19 is currently ongoing with ruxolitinib (ChiCTR2000029580).On the other side, IFN is one of the most potent innate immune responses to prevent viral replication during the early phases of infection [110] . The activation of transcription through JAK/STAT signaling pathway by IFNs leads to the upregulation of several interferon stimulated genes which have the ability to rapidly kill viruses within infected cells [111] . Almost all viruses have developed strategies to combat the effects of type 1 and type 3 IFNs by blocking the IFN signaling pathway [112] and viral encoded factors able to antagonize the JAK/STAT pathway are crucial determinants of virulence [113] . In particular, Influenza A viruses disrupt JAK/STAT signaling by reducing the expression of the IFN receptor and by directly inhibiting IFN signaling [114] . As a consequence, JAK/STAT blockade generated by baricitinib certainly produces an impairment of IFN-mediated anti-viral response, with a potential facilitating effect on the progression of SARS-CoV2 infection at the moment not yet better quantified.In conclusion, evidence of the possible use of baricitinib in the treatment of COVID-19 infection remains highly controversial and further studies are warranted to better clarify its potential role in the treatment of more serious cases of viral pneumonia.The COVID-19 epidemic represents a health emergency that is inevitably affecting the management of a complex disease such as RA [115, 116] . As a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder, RA carries a higher infectious risk than the general population. The use of synthetic and biologic disease-modifying drugs is associated with a potential further increase in the incidence of serious infections, but the poor control of RA disease activity is an even greater infectious risk factor. Thus, RA patients should be encouraged to continue their treatment even during COVID-19 outbreak. In our opinion, this strategy is reasonable as it aims to prevent disease flares that can contributes to increase patient burden, disability, poor quality of life, and healthcare use [117] . In addition, the discontinuation of ongoing treatments could lead to the need to introduce CS as bridging therapy, which may further increase the risk of viral infection, as well as being inappropriate for the management of SARS-CoV2 interstitial pneumonia.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently included in the treatment protocol for the management of COVID-19 infections and might be useful to prevent or mitigate the course of infection in patients with RA taking them as csDMARDs. The use of IL-6 inhibitors as tocilizumab or sarilumab seems to be promising for the management of most critical cases of interstitial pneumonia complicated by CRS, but the identification of definite criteria to discriminate patients to be treated with these compounds is still under debate. Finally, although baricitinib has the potential to affect SARS-CoV2 penetration into pulmonary epithelial cells, major concerns remain about the inhibition of IFNs activity which could be detrimental in the course of viral infection."
8eh90ber,TH17 Responses in Cytokine Storm of COVID-19: An Emerging Target of JAK2 Inhibitor Fedratinib,"COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to pulmonary edema and lung failure, and have liver, heart, and kidney damages 1 responses or enhanced IL-17-related pathways are also observed in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV patients 5,6 . In MERS-CoV patients, higher IL-17 with lower IFNγ and IFNα have worse outcome than the reversed phenotype 5 . Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus also induces strong TH17 (and TH1) responses 7 . In a mouse model, H1N1 causes acute lung injury in an IL-17-dependent manner 8 . Taken together, the TH17 type response contributes to the cytokine storm in pulmonary viral infection including SARS-CoV-2, which results in tissue damage and likely promotes pulmonary edema; targeting the TH17 pathway may benefit the patients with TH17 dominant immune profiles.Since it will take several years to develop specific drugs to treat COVID-19, repurposing currently marketed drugs would provide valuable opportunities. There are several antibodybased TH17 blockades (anti-IL-17, anti-IL-17R and anti-IL-12/23p40) available; however, the antibody-based treatment is expensive and has only a narrow spectrum of effects. Several RORγt (and RORα) inhibitors currently on clinic trials would be promising TH17 blockers in a near future. Here, we propose an alternative method to inhibit TH17 responses.STAT3, a transcription factor mediates IL-6 and IL-23 signals for TH17 cell initial differentiation and effector function. Both IL-6 and IL-23 activate STAT3 through JAK2 (IL-6 also use JAK1) 9 , whereas IL-21 activates STAT3 (and STAT1 and STAT5) through JAK1 and JAK3. We postulate that JAK2 inhibitors can be used to restrict the proinflammatory function of existing TH17 cells. In addition to JAK2 inhibitors, several FDA approved STAT3 inhibitors are also promising but may affect IL-21 signals in B cells. Type I interferons are important in anti-viral immunity, but type I interferons employ JAK1 and TYK2 to activate STAT1 and STAT2. Therefore, specific JAK2 inhibitors would not disrupt the signals of type I interferons.We tested Fedratinib (SAR302503, TG101348), a JAK2 inhibitor approved by FDA for myeloproliferative neoplasms, on TH17 cell cytokine production. Fedratinib is specific for JAK2 but does not affect JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2. We found that Fedratinib treatment decreased the expression of IL-17 by murine TH17 cells, and this suppressive effect was even profound when IL-23 was added (Fig. 1 ). In addition, Fedratinib also inhibited the expression of IL-22 by TH17 cells (Fig. 1) . Besides, Fedratinib only has marginal effects on IL-21 expression (Fig. 1) , suggesting that Fedratinib does not compromise IL-21 mediated B cell function. In addition, GM-CSF also uses JAK2 to transduce signals; therefore, JAK2 inhibitor would also suppress GM-CSF function. In a murine model of multiple sclerosis, a TH17 and TH1-driven autoimmune brain disease, subcutaneous administration of JAK2 inhibitor tyrphostin B42, during the disease induction, greatly decreased the disease severity 10 . In summary, JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib can suppress the production of several TH17 signature cytokines, therefore promising to prevent the deteriorating outcomes of TH17 associated cytokine storm in COVID-19 and other severe viral infections. The JAK2 inhibitor can also be used in combination of anti-viral drugs and supportive treatments. Because JAK2 inhibition is reversible, transient treatment with this inhibitor before the disease transition from serious to critical or during the critical phase would not affect TH17 responses essential for innate immune responses and immunity against extracellular pathogens.All authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.XOY is supported by NIH AI142200.

f6muhf3d,"Prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CL (pro)) structure: virtual screening reveals velpatasvir, ledipasvir, and other drug repurposing candidates","On 7 January 2020, a new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV (now officially named SARS-CoV-2) was implicated in an alarming outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness COVID-19, originating from Wuhan City, Hubei, China. Human-to-human transmission was first confirmed in Guangdong, China 1 . The World Health Organisation has declared this a global public health emergency -on 15 February 2020, there are more than 65,000 confirmed cases reported, and the death toll is over 1500. In the height of the crisis, this virus is spreading at a rate and scale far worse than previous coronaviral epidemics.It was immediately evident from its genome that the coronavirus is evolutionarily related (80% identity) to the beta-coronavirus implicated in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which originated in bats and was causative of a global outbreak in 2003. The momentum of research on developing antiviral agents against the SARS-CoV carried on after the epidemic subsided. Despite this, no SARS treatment has yet come to fruition; however, knowledge acquired from the extensive research and development efforts may be of use to inform the current therapeutic options.The viral genome encodes more than 20 proteins, among which are two proteases (PL pro and 3CL pro ) that are vital to virus replication; they cleave the two translated polyproteins (PP1A and PP1AB) into individual functional components. The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro , aka main protease, M pro ) is considered to be a promising drug target. Tremendous effort has been spent on studying this protein in order to identify therapeutics against the SARS-CoV in particular and other pathogenic coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in general because they share similar active sites and enzymatic mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to build a molecular model of the 3CL pro of the SARS-CoV-2 and to carry out virtual screening to identify readily usable therapeutics. It was not our intention, however, to comment on other structure-based drug design research as these will not be timely for the current epidemic.The translated polyprotein (PP1AB) sequence was obtained from the annotation of the GenBank entry of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (accession number MN908947). By comparing this sequence with the SARS-CoV PP1AB sequence (accession number ABI96956), the protease cleavage sites and all mature protein sequences were obtained. Sequence comparison and alignment were performed with BLASTp.The high-resolution apo-enzyme structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (PDBID: 2DUC) 2 was employed as the template. The variant residues were ""mutated"" in silico by SCWRL4 3 , followed by manual adjustment to ensure that the best side-chain rotamer was employed ( Table 2 ). The rebuilt model was subjected to steepest descent energy minimisation by Gromacs 2018.4 using the Gromos 54A7 forcefield, with a restraint force constant of 1000 kJ mol -1 nm -2 applied on all backbone atoms and all atoms of the vital residues (Table 1) . Accessible surface area of residues were calculated with areaimol of the CCP4 suite v7.0.MTiOpenScreen web service 4 was used for screening against its library of 7173 purchasable drugs (Drugs-lib), with the binding site grid specified by the active-site residues. The active sites on chain A and chain B were screened independently with AutoDock Vina 5 . When the crystal structure was released, it was stripped of its inhibitor and subjected to a screening. A list of 4,500 target:ligand docking combinations ranked by binding energies was produced for each screen. The top 10 or 11 (ranked using a binding energy cut-off) hits for chains A and B were examined visually in PyMOL (version 1.7.X) 6 .An earlier version of this article can be found on ChemRxiv (DOI: 10.26434/chemrxiv.11831103.v2).The first available genome was GenBank MN908947, now NCBI Reference Sequence NC_045512. From it, the PP1AB sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was extracted and aligned with that of SARS-CoV. The overall amino-acid sequence identity is very high (86%). The conservation is noticeable at the polyprotein cleavage sites. All 11 3CL pro sites 2 are highly conserved or identical (Extended data 7 , Table S1), inferring that their respective proteases have very similar specificities. The 3CL pro sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has only 12 out of 306 residues different from that of SARS-CoV (identity = 96%).We compared the polyprotein PP1AB and the 3CL pro sequences among all 11 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (GenBank MN908947, 3D model of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro The amino acids that are known to be important for the enzyme's functions are listed in Table 1 . Not unexpectedly, none of the 12 variant positions are involved in major roles. Therefore, we are confident to prepare a structural model of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro by molecular modelling (Extended data 7 , Figure S1 ), which will be immediately useful for in silico development of targeted treatment. After we submitted the first draft of this study, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro was solved and released (PDB ID 6LU7), which confirms that the predicted model is good within experimental errors (Extended data 7 , Figure S2 ).When examined in molecular graphics 6 , all solutions were found to fit into their respective active sites convincingly. The binding energies of chain A complexes were generally higher than those of chain B by approximately 1.4 kcal mol -1 (Table 3) . This presumably demonstrates the intrinsic conformational variability between the A-and B-chain active sites in the crystal structure (the average root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) in Cα atomic positions of active-site residues is 0.83 Å). In each screen, the differences in binding energies are small, suggesting that the ranking is not discriminatory, and all top scorers should be examined. We combined the two screens and found 16 candidates which give promising binding models (etoposide and its phosphate counted as one) ( Table 3) .We checked the actions, targets and side effects of the 16 candidates. Among these, we first noticed velpatasvir ( Figure 1A , D) and ledipasvir, which are inhibitors of the NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both are marketed as approved drugs in combination with sofosbuvir, which is a prodrug nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or NS5B). Interestingly, sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the SARS-CoV-2 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronaviruses 14 . Our results further strengthen that these dual-component HCV drugs, Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), may be attractive candidates to repurpose because they may inhibit two coronaviral enzymes. A drug that can target two viral proteins substantially reduces the ability of the virus to develop resistance. These direct-acting antiviral drugs are also associated with very minimal side effects and are conveniently orally administered (Table 4 ).The flavonoid glycosides diosmin ( Figure 1B ) and hesperidin ( Figure 1E ), obtained from citrus fruits, fit very well into and block the substrate binding site. Yet, these compounds Table 2 . In silico mutagenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . The 12 variant residues with reference to the SARS-CoV enzyme are shown with the respective treatment of rotamer. ""A"" and ""B"" refers to the individual chains of the dimeric model. Both chains are in the crystal asymmetric unit and are not identical. The rotamer symbol (bracketed) is defined according to the conventions of Richardson 15 , followed by its respective rank of popularity. ASA: accessible surface area (average of A and B chains) of the residue in the SARS-CoV 3CL pro structure, in Å 2 and in % relative to the ASA of a residue X in the Gly-X-Gly conformation.Residue Rotamer ASA, Å 2 (%) Remarks on replacement (Table 4) . Hesperidin hits showed up multiple times, suggesting it has many modes of binding ( Figure 1A ). Teniposide and etoposide (and its phosphate) are chemically related and turned up in multiple hits with good binding models ( Figure 1F ). However, these chemotherapy drugs have a lot of strong side effects and need intravenous administration (Table 4 ). The approved drug venetoclax ( Figure 1C ) and investigational drugs MK-3207 and R428 scored well in both screens. Venetoclax is another chemotherapy drug that is burdened by side effects including upper respiratory tract infection (Table 4) . Not much has been disclosed about MK-3207 and R428.We subjected the crystal structure to the same virtual screening procedures. A very similar list of candidates showed up consistently (Extended data 7 , Table S2 ) with high scores although ledipasvir was not found.We noticed that most of the compounds on the list have molecular weights (MW) over 500, except lumacaftor (MW=452). The largest one is ledipasvir (MW=889). This is because the size of the peptide substrate and the deeply buried protease active site demand a large molecule that has many rotatable dynamics to fit into it.We identified five trials on ClinicalTrials.gov involving antiviral and immunomodulatory drug treatments for SARS ( One record which receives a lot of attention amid the current outbreak is the lopinavir/ritonavir combination 18 . They are protease inhibitors originally developed against HIV. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, despite lacking a clinical trial, they were tried as an emergency measure and found to offer improved clinical outcome 18 . However, some scientists did express scepticism 19 . By analogy, these compounds were speculated to act on SARS-CoV 3CL pro specifically, but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that, although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes 20-23 . The IC 50 value of lopinavir is 50 μM (K i = 14 μM) and that for ritonavir cannot be established 24 . Although this is far from a cure, based on our results that the two CoV 3CL pro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned, we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing (early February 2020).If we look beyond the 3CL pro , an earlier screen produced 27 candidates that could be repurposed against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 25 . In addition, the other coronaviral proteins could be targeted for screening. Treatment of the COVID-19 with remdesivir (a repurposed drug in development targeting the RdRp) showing improved clinical outcome has just been reported and clinical trial is now underway 26 .We consider this work part of the global efforts responding in a timely fashion to fight this deadly communicable disease. We are aware that there are similar modelling, screening and repurposing exercises targeting 3CL pro reported or announced 20,27-33 . Our methods did not overlap, and we share no common results with these studies.

73a7uvyz,Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of viruses that co-infect humans and other vertebrate animals. CoV infections affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous systems of humans, livestock, birds, bats, mice, and many other wild animals [1] [2] [3] . For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 were both coronaviruses that transmitted from animals to humans [4, 5] . The source of unexplained pneumonia was first discovered in Wuhan in Dec, 2019, and SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients. It belongs to a new evolutionary branch within the CoV. On Feb. 11th, 2020, the new coronavirus was officially renamed ""SARS-CoV-2"" from ""2019-nCoV"" [6] . The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) [7] . According to On Nov. 27th, 2002, a respiratory illness erupted in Guangdong Province, China [19] . In Feb, 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Health announced that this acute respiratory syndrome had thus far resulted in 305 cases and five deaths [20] . The following month, there were clusters of atypical pneumonia reported in other parts of mainland China, Hong Kong [21] , Canada [22] , and Singapore [23] . In Jul, 2003, SARS-CoV spread across 26 countries in six continents, and caused a cumulative 8,096 cases and 774 deaths (9.6%) [24] . In particular, a higher mortality (21%) was found in hospital personnel [25, 26] .On Dec. 29th, 2019, the health departments of Hubei Province received a report that four employees of the South China Seafood Wholesale Market were diagnosed with unknown-caused pneumonia in a local hospital, which was the first report of SARS-CoV-2 [27] . On Dec. 31st, 2019, the National Health Commission of People Republic of China and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) participated in the investigation and case-searching work [27] . On the same day, the government of Wuhan released information about the disease outbreaks to society [28] . Nowadays, the number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to climb worldwide. By the date of this paper's submission, a cumulative 67,081 cases and 1,526 deaths (2.1%) were reported worldwide. In Wuhan, China, the number is 37,914. The main timeline of SARS and COVID-19 epidemic development were shown in Figure 1a ,b, respectively. Glucocorticoid and interferon Lopinavir/ritonavir (in testing)On Nov. 27th, 2002, a respiratory illness erupted in Guangdong Province, China [19] .

By the date of this paper's submission, a cumulative 67,081 cases and 1,526 deaths (2.1%) were The initial symptoms of SARS patients were fever (100%), cough (61.8%), myalgia (48.7%), dyspnea (40.8%), and diarrhea (31.6%) [29] , and the prognosis of patients was associated with host characteristics (including age, gender, etc.) [30] . During hospitalization, respiratory distress occurred in 90.8% of SARS patients [29] . The duration from disease onset to severe respiratory distress was an average of 9.8 ± 3.0 days [29] . During the disease course, some patients developed leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia with an upregulation of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) [29] . In comparison, COVID-19 showed similar trends with SARS patients [28] . Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main manifestations of the patients, while nasal congestion, runny nose, and other symptoms of the upper respiratory tract are rare. Beijing Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention indicated that the typical case of COVID-19 has a progressive aggravation process. COVID-19 can be classified into light, normal, severe, and critical types based on the severity of the disease [31] : (1) Mild cases-the clinical symptoms were mild, and no pneumonia was found on the chest computed tomography (CT); (2) normal cases-fever, respiratory symptoms, and patients found to have imaging manifestations of pneumonia; (3) severe cases-one of the following three conditions: Respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min (in resting state, refers to oxygen saturation ≤ 93%), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) critical cases-one of the following three conditions: Respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or the associated failure of other organs requiring the intensive care unit [32] . The current clinical data shows that the majority of the deaths occurred in the older patients. However, severe cases have been documented in young adults who have unique factors, particularly those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or hepatitis B. Those with a long-term use of hormones or immunosuppressants, and decreased immune function, are likely to get severely infected.The incubation period of SARS is 1-4 days [33] . However, in a small number of patients, the incubation period may be longer than 10 days [34] . It has been demonstrated that the latency of COVID-19 varies from 3-7 days on average, for up to 14 days [35] . During this incubation period, patients are contagious, and it has been reported that each case infected on average 3.77 other people (uncertainty range 2.23-4.82) [36] . By comparison, we found that the average latency of COVID-19 is slightly longer than that of SARS.According to the demographic information of SARS patients, infection occurred in all age groups (the average age was dyspnea (40.8%), and diarrhea (31.6%) [29] , and the prognosis of patients was associated with host characteristics (including age, gender, etc.) [30] . During hospitalization, respiratory distress occurred in 90.8% of SARS patients [29] . The duration from disease onset to severe respiratory distress was an average of 9.8 ± 3.0 days [29] . During the disease course, some patients developed leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia with an upregulation of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) [29] .In comparison, COVID-19 showed similar trends with SARS patients [28] . Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main manifestations of the patients, while nasal congestion, runny nose, and other symptoms of the upper respiratory tract are rare. Beijing Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention indicated that the typical case of COVID-19 has a progressive aggravation process. COVID-19 can be classified into light, normal, severe, and critical types based on the severity of the disease [31] : (1) Mild cases-the clinical symptoms were mild, and no pneumonia was found on the chest computed tomography (CT); (2) normal cases-fever, respiratory symptoms, and patients found to have imaging manifestations of pneumonia; (3) severe cases-one of the following three conditions: Respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 times / min (in resting state, refers to oxygen saturation ≤ 93%), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) critical cases-one of the following three conditions: Respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or the associated failure of other organs requiring the intensive care unit [32] . The current clinical data shows that the majority of the deaths occurred in the older patients. However, severe cases have been documented in young adults who have unique factors, particularly those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or hepatitis B. Those with a long-term use of hormones or immunosuppressants, and decreased immune function, are likely to get severely infected.The incubation period of SARS is 1-4 days [33] . However, in a small number of patients, the incubation period may be longer than 10 days [34] . It has been demonstrated that the latency of COVID-19 varies from 3-7 days on average, for up to 14 days [35] . During this incubation period, patients are contagious, and it has been reported that each case infected on average 3.77 other people (uncertainty range 2.23-4.82) [36] . By comparison, we found that the average latency of COVID-19 is slightly longer than that of SARS.According to the demographic information of SARS patients, infection occurred in all age groups (the average age was ≦45) [37] . There was a proportional difference between male and female (female predominance) [37] , with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.25 [38] . In addition, hospital staff had a higher risk due to the proximal interactions with large numbers from the infected population. For example, hospital staff accounted for 22% of all cases in Hong Kong and 22.8% in Guangdong [37] . The mortality caused by SARS increased with age (> 64 years) [37] , and the overall mortality rate during the outbreak of SARS was estimated at 9.6% [39, 40] .Li et al. reported that people who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are all susceptible to COVID-19 [41] . Among the 8,866 patients who have been confirmed with COVID-19, nearly half of the patients have been aged 50 years or older (47.7%) [36] . The male-to-female ratio is about 2.7:1 [38] and the average incubation period is 5.2 days [42] . However, severe COVID-19 cases and deaths have mostly been in the middle-aged adults and the elderly with long smoking histories or other 45) [37] .

However, severe COVID-19 cases and deaths have mostly been in the middle-aged adults and the elderly with long smoking histories or other basic diseases, such as heart disease and hypertension [43, 44] . At the time that this paper was been submitted, COVID-19 patients mortality rate was 2.1% [45] .In 2010, Shi et al. isolated a SARS-like coronavirus which was highly homologous to the SARS-CoV, confirming that Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat) was a natural host of the SARS-CoV [46] . Bats are known to be hosts for 30 coronaviruses based on complete genomic sequences analysis [47] . Epidemiological investigations have shown that civet cats in the wildlife market were the direct source of SARS-CoV [48] . Among the four patients with SARS discovered during the winter of 2003-2004, two were waitresses at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, and one was a customer who Viruses 2020, 12, 244 5 of 17 ate in the restaurant a short distance from a civet cage. All six civets in this cage were tested positive for SARS-CoV [48] .The new emerging SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80% of the gene sequence of SARS-CoV, released by the Military Medical Research Institute of Nanjing Military Region in 2003 [28] . Recently, Shi et al. reported that the sequence similarity of coronavirus between SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus isolated from Rhinolophus affinis is 96.2%, and suggested that bats may be the source of the virus [49] . So far, the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are elusive and have been reported to be snakes, minks, or variable others [50, 51] . Recently, a research group of South China Agricultural University reported that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, by analyzing more than 1,000 metagenomic samples, because they found that 70% of pangolins are positive for the coronavirus. Moreover, the virus isolate from pangolin shared 99% sequence similarity with the current infected human strain SARS-CoV-2 [52] . Taking this recent research into consideration, we agreed that pangolin is more likely to be one of intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.According to the WHO data on Jul. 31th, 2003 [24] , a total of 8,096 clinically diagnosed cases of SARS were reported worldwide, with 774 deaths and 26 countries and regions affected (Figure 2a ). Most cases were in Asia, Europe, and America. The main countries in Asia were China (including mainland, Macao, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Singapore, and so on. The total number of cases in mainland China was 5,327, with 349 deaths [53] . The cases were mainly concentrated in Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanxi ( Figure 2b ) [54] . In total, 2,102 patients were from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with 336 deaths [24] .Viruses 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 18 basic diseases, such as heart disease and hypertension [43, 44] .

Taking this recent research into consideration, we agreed that pangolin is more likely to be one of intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. According to the latest data on Feb. 14th, 2020 [55, 56] , there have been a total of 67,081 clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in worldwide, with 1,526 deaths. A total of 25 countries and regions have infected people. Due to the Spring Festival transportation peak, the disease has been spread more rapidly across China (Figure 2c ). As the origin area of COVID-19, Hubei province has been the most severely infected area, with 54,406 cumulative diagnosis cases. Wuhan city has 37,914 cases. Guangdong, Henan, and Zhejiang province have 1,294 cases, 1,212 cases, and 1,162 cases, respectively (Figure 2d ). At present, the COVID-19 outbreak has been spread to all parts of China and around the world, including the United States, Thailand, and Japan. It has been noticed that most of these patients have ever been to Wuhan or contacted with people who had been in Wuhan. The distribution of COVID-2019 patients in China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) and Hubei Province is shown in Figure 3 .SARS were reported worldwide, with 774 deaths and 26 countries and regions affected (Figure 2a) . Most cases were in Asia, Europe, and America. The main countries in Asia were China (including mainland, Macao, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Singapore, and so on. The total number of cases in mainland China was 5,327, with 349 deaths [53] . The cases were mainly concentrated in Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanxi (Figure 2b ) [54] . In total, 2,102 patients were from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with 336 deaths [24] .According to the latest data on Feb. 14th, 2020 [55, 56] , there have been a total of 67,081 clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in worldwide, with 1,526 deaths.

At present, the COVID-19 outbreak has been spread to all parts of China and around the world, including the United States, Thailand, and Japan. It has been noticed that most of these patients have ever been to Wuhan or contacted with people who had been in Wuhan. The distribution of COVID-2019 patients in China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) and Hubei Province is shown in Figure 3 . As the number of COVID-19 patients in China has been growing rapidly, preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the most important and urgent task [57] . It was shown that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has spread via droplets or close contacts [58, 59] , but aerosol and fecal-oral transmission still need further study [60, 61] . To reduce virus transmission, early detection and isolation are essential. In addition, close monitoring in crowded places is also important [62] . The possible pathogens of SARS and COVID-19 are both derived from wild animals [63] . Therefore, hunting, selling, and eating wild animals not only seriously damage the ecosystem, but also lead to the spread of epidemic diseases [64] . Thus, banning all wildlife trade is an effective measure to prevent viral prevalence. Wearing level-D protective clothing can protect medical staff from infection of respiratory viruses [65] . A vaccine against SARS-CoV has not been described in any published articles [66] . However, on Jan. 26th, 2020, the China CDC started to develop a new vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The virus has been successfully isolated and seed strains have been screened [67] .The early symptoms of SARS and COVID-19 are very similar to winter influenza, and the most important way to distinguish flu and pneumonia is to take throat swabs for viral testing [68] . Current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, as well as real-time RT-LAMP [69] [70] [71] [72] . National Medical Products Administration has approved seven new nucleic acid test reagents for coronavirus, which were developed based on fluorescence PCR by Feb. 1st, 2020 [73] . Suspected infections can be detected accurately and quickly for timely isolation and treatment to avoid infecting others by using these test reagents.Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are CoVs; hence, the treatment strategies of SARS could be relevant for COVID-19 [74] . In 2003, SARS was mainly treated by isolation of the patients, hormones treatment, antiviral and symptomatic treatments, and many drugs such as glucocorticoid [29] and interferon [75] . Now, isolation, antiviral, and symptomatic treatments are still mainly adopted for COVID-19 treatment. As effective drugs for SARS, hormones and interferons can also be used to treat COVID-19 [74] . Lopinavir is one kind of protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection, with ritonavir as a booster. Lopinavir and/or ritonavir has anti coronavirus activity in vitro. Hong Kong scholars found that, compared with ribavirin alone, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin had lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death caused by SARS-CoV [76, 77] . Lopinavir/ritonavir has also been clinically tested in treatment of COVID-19, and showed wonderfully effective treatment for some patients, but the general clinical effect has not been determined [78] .More effective treatments are still under continuing exploration: On Jan. 25th, 2020, a joint research team from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shanghai Tech University screened and identified 30 potential drugs that are reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [79] . A high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) was announced after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world [80] , and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been treated as severe pathogens in respiratory tract infections. Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease [81] . The first patient in the US had been trial-treated with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development) due to a severe infection [82, 83] . No adverse reactions were observed during the administration, and the patient's condition was effectively improved [84] . Clinical trials of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 just started on Feb. 5th and 12th, 2020 in Wuhan and Beijing, respectively, and the experimental results remain unclear [85, 86] .CoVs are RNA viruses and contain the largest genomes of all RNA viruses [87] . CoVs belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, and this subfamily includes four genera: α-coronavirus, β-coronavirus, γ-coronavirus, and δ-coronavirus [88] . Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are in the coronavirus family, β-coronavirus genera [89] . The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 85% similar to the genome of the SARS-like virus ZC45 (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1), and together these types of viruses form a unique Orthocoronavirinae subfamily with another SARS-like virus ZXC21 in the sarbecovirus subgenus [35] . All the three viruses show typical β-coronavirus gene structure. Human SARS-CoV and a genetically similar bat coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZXC21, MG772934) from southwest of China have formed another clade within the sarbecovirus [35] .We also performed comparative genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by zpicture. The results showed that the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have extremely high homology at the nucleotide level (Figure 4a,b) . There are six regions of difference (RD) in the genome sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the RDs are named according to the order of discovery. RD1, RD2, and RD3 (448nt, 55nt, and 278nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of the orf lab gene; RD4 and RD5 (315nt and 80nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of the S gene; RD6 is 214nt in size and is part of the coding sequence of the orf7b and orf8 genes. These RDs may sequences of the orf lab gene; RD4 and RD5 (315nt and 80nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of the S gene; RD6 is 214nt in size and is part of the coding sequence of the orf7b and orf8 genes. These RDs may provide new molecular markers for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and also help to develop new drugs against SARS-CoV-2.To analyze the homogeneity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary tree was constructed based on the genomes of 35 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different data submission units, one SARS-CoV strain, and two MERS-CoV strains ( Figure S1 ). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the distance of SARS-CoV (AY274119) is closer to SARS-CoV-2 strains than MERS-CoV (KC164505, JX869059). To analyze the homogeneity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary tree was constructed based on the genomes of 35 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different data submission units, one SARS-CoV strain, and two MERS-CoV strains ( Figure S1 ). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the distance of SARS-CoV (AY274119) is closer to SARS-CoV-2 strains than MERS-CoV (KC164505, JX869059).To further explore whether all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to that of SARS-CoV, we performed a protein sequence alignment analysis using Blastp. The results showed that most of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are highly homologous (95%-100%) to the proteins of SARS-CoV virus, indicating the evolutionary similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2) . However, two proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2 have no homologous proteins in SARS-CoV. The amino acid sequence of orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 is different from sequences of conserved orf8 or orf8b derived from human SARS-CoV [11] . Orf8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 does not contain known functional domain or motif. An aggregation motif VLVVL (amino acid 75-79) has been found in SARS-CoV orf8b which was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activate NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes [90] . Therefore, it will be clinically meaningful to analyze the biological function of these two specific proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2. As the most abundant protein in CoVs, nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly conserved across CoVs [91] . The N protein in SARS-CoV-2 shares~90% amino acid identity with that in SARS-CoV [28] , which indicates that antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV would likely recognize and bind the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well. N antibodies do not provide immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the antibodies have a cross reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein viruses, which would allow a serum-based assay to identify the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected-cases [28] . Although previous studies have found serum reactivity to group SARS-CoV N proteins in Chinese populations [92] , exposure to SARS-CoV-2 should increase the dilution factor if the infection had occurred. This information has important implications for preventing the spread of asymptomatic infections.In addition, spike stalk S2 in SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45) and human SARS-CoV [11] . Thus, the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 has the potential to be effective treatment [93] .Many studies have been performed to study the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV [94] [95] [96] . The spike (S) protein and N protein confer stability to the viral particle [97] . The N protein is a structural protein involved in virion assembly, and plays a pivotal role in virus transcription and assembly efficiency [97] . S protein can bind to the cellular receptors of sensitive cells and mediate infection of their target cells, after which it begins to replicate in the cytoplasm [98] . SARS-CoV mainly targets the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels and causes systemic vasculitis and decrease of immune function [99] . More seriously, the infection leads to extensive pulmonary consolidation, diffuse alveolar damage, and the formation of a transparent membrane, finally deteriorating to respiratory distress [100] .CoV can enter host cells through the interaction between CoV S protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is isolated from SARS-CoV-permissive Vero-E6 cells. The receptor-binding motif (RBM) of S protein can directly contact ACE2 [47, 101, 102] . AEC2 have been identified to be key binding residues and functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and it can also protect alveolar cells [103] . The binding of spike protein to ACE2 and the subsequent downregulation of this receptor contribute to severe alveolar injury during SARS [49] . The downregulation of ACE2 results in the excessive production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE, and the stimulation of type 1A angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1A) can lead to the increase of pulmonary vascular permeability, which potentially explains the increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is decreased [104] . ACE2-transfected T cells form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein.The virus was shown to replicate effectively in ACE2-transfected, but not in mock-transfected T cells. Antibodies targeting ACE2 can block viral replication in Vero-E6 cells [105] .Recently, Ji et al. demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of binding ACE2 in the context of the SARS-CoV spike protein [51] . Among SRAS-CoV spike protein's fourteen residues predicted to interact directly with human ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV, eight amino acids are well conserved in homology SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [26, 102] . At the same time, Wan et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to infect humans, bats, civets, monkeys, and swine, but not mice [106] . Compared to previously reported SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors more efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2003), but less efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2002) [106] . The mutation of proteins determines two important characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2: A higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat-like SARS-CoV, but a lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV [43] .As a large number of people have left Wuhan, the control of the epidemic situation is extremely urgent, and the treatments of COVID-19 are imminent. On Feb. 14th, 2020, there were more than 54,000 confirmed patients in Hubei province, China [55] . Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, the prognosis of patients solely depends on their age and physical condition [74] . Although it was reported that the clinically recovered patients exceed the number of dead, the majority of the patients are still not cured in hospital. In addition, the potential adaptive mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes it difficult for vaccine development. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop more sensitive inspection methods and effective drugs.Seven type of CoVs have been identified to cause human disease [107] . The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans. The other four human CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) induce only mild upper respiratory diseases, although some of them can cause severe infections in infants, young children, and elderly individuals [4, 108] . The latest one is SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shared almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV [11] . Our results also showed that almost all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins ( Table 2) . Hence, clinical drugs and therapies for treating SARS may be used as a reference for COVID-19 treatment [74] .In addition to the well-known SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as one Merbecovirus subgenus of β-CoVs, is also extremely invasive. MERS-CoV is the pathogen of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which can infect both humans and animals, and can be transmitted through camels [109] . It mainly occurs in Saudi Arabia and has a high mortality rate [66] . Studies had demonstrated that the clinical course of SARS and MERS was highly similar, and SARS and MERS may have similar pathogenesis [66] . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV. It will be very interesting to study the relationship among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 that may be exploited for future developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.Although more and more studies for SARS-CoV-2 have sprung up since the outbreak of this epidemic COVID-19, based on our comparison, we propose some key questions to be clarified in future studies (Table 3 ). In-depth understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will reveal more targets for better therapy of COVID-19. Table 3 . Proposed questions to study SARS-CoV-2 for future studies.What is the effect of the surface epitope and receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the virus' infectivity?Is there any effect of SARS-CoV vaccine designed according to S protein on SARS-CoV-2?Does SARS-CoV-2 orf8 and orf10 proteins, which have no homology proteins in SARS-CoV, play roles in the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?Can the susceptibility of asymptomatic carriers be judged by detecting the serum reactivity level of N protein?Apart from droplet transmission and contact transmission, are there other methods to transmit SARS-CoV-2?What is the percentage of COVID-19 patients have been infected with SARS and produced antibodies?Is there an effective specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 solution?Does traditional Chinese medicine have any effect on the treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2?Do ethnic differences affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?Do any environmental factors, such as regional conditions or climate, affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission?Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/2/244/s1, Figure S1 : Phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

nxfr24sp,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in a Hemodialysis Patient,"In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (coronavirus disease 2019 ) was reported in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, with sporadic cases reported globally, becoming a global health emergency. 1 COVID-19 pneumonia has had a significant impact on people's health and social activity behavior and on economic development. The Chinese government reported that 78,195 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed, 2,491 cases were suspected, and 2,718 patients had died as of February 26, 2020. 2 The outbreak of COVID-19 led to the closure of Wuhan, workers were delayed to work, and schools were closed across China. Although the majority of cases are mild, a certain proportion of patients develop critical illness, with a documented casefatality rate of 2.3% in China. 1 Reports to date indicate that although patients of all ages are susceptible to the disease, individuals developing critical illness were older and had a greater number of comorbid conditions, 3 suggesting that patients with comorbid conditions have high mortality rates and poor outcomes.Kidney failure is a severe medical condition with a high prevalence of comorbid conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, disproportionately affecting older adults. 4 According to the China National Data System, 5 there were 579,381 hemodialysis patients in China in 2018, including 33,795 hemodialysis patients in Hubei Province. Because hemodialysis patients are older and have more underlying diseases, they likely are more susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia than the general population. This report describes the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in a hemodialysis patient and reviews our management of this individual, as well as measures to reduce transmission to other hemodialysis patients and staff.A man in his 50s receiving maintenance hemodialysis presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of a nonproductive cough. His medical history included kidney failure due to diabetes maintained on thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis, hypertension, and chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Epidemiologic survey showed that he drove to Wuhan in mid-January 2020, visited his relatives, and drove back to Zhongshan City of Guangdong province in China 1 week later.The patient was admitted to the hospital 2 weeks later with hypoxemia (blood oxygen saturation of 90% while breathing room air) without fever or myalgia. Physical examination results showed temperature of 36.9 C, blood pressure of 184/107 mm Hg, heart rate of 74 beats/min, and bilateral normal lung respiratory sounds. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count of 3.38 ×10 9 /L with 77.5% neutrophils, 15.7% lymphocytes, and 0% eosinophils. C-Reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were 40.1 mg/L and 0.73 ng/mL, respectively. Liver function and cardiac enzyme levels were within the normal range. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities (Fig 1) . The Chinese Guangdong Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests Q2 were positive in throat swab samples 2 times. Based on epidemiologic characteristics and these findings, we diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia.As soon as COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed, the patient was transferred to a specialty hospitaland received hemodialysis in a room with isolation facilities designated for patients with COVID-19 infection. Although all hemodialysis patients wear a face mask during dialysis, the other 42 patients who had a potential exposure to COVID-19 due to receiving dialysis in the same room were also transferred to the isolation ward of the specialty hospital with regular dialysis for 14 days. These hemodialysis Complete author and article information provided before references.Correspondence to S. Liu (13543456446@139.com) patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Q3 nucleic acid at admission and at 14 days, remaining negative. Because of universal precautions taken by the medical staff, the staff tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid had negative results and were not isolated.The patient was treated with oxygen support by nasal cannula, regular hemodialysis, antihypertensive medications, moxifloxacin (400 mg daily), and lopinavir/ritonavir (1 tablet twice daily) antiviral therapy. The potential side effects of lopinavir/ritonavir, such as nausea, diarrhea, and occasional dizziness, were not observed during treatment. After 8 days of treatment, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were negative in throat swab samples twice, cough had improved, and laboratory tests results and computed tomographic chest images had improved (Fig 1) . The patient was discharged from the hospital.In this report, we describe the clinical course of a hemodialysis patient who developed COVID-19 infection. The clinical presentation of the patient was similar to patients with atypical symptom COVID-19 infection. Although the patient did not have many of the typical symptoms, including fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache, or myalgia, he had cough, dyspnea, and typical changes of bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities on computed tomographic images of the chest.According to the Chinese criteria for diagnosis of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (trial version 6), 6 suspected cases can be divided into 2 case definitions: the first requires epidemiologic history of likely exposure and any 2 clinical criteria (fever and/or respiratory symptoms, imaging characteristics of pneumonia, and normal or decreased total number of white blood cells or lymphocytes in early onset), and the second requires no clear epidemiologic history of exposure but presents with at least 3 of the clinical manifestations described. Confirmation requires a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test result.Because hemodialysis patients have disorders of B-and T-cell function, 7,8 patients may have atypical presentations. Lymphopenia is common in patients with COVID-19 infection and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality in general patients. 9 Cao and colleagues Q4 reported that the most common laboratory abnormalities were depressed total lymphocytes, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels in COVID-19 pneumonia. 10 Given low lymphocyte counts in hemodialysis patients chronically, lymphopenia likely is not helpful for identifying individuals with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Procalcitonin has similar limitations, with levels chronically elevated in hemodialysis patients even in the absence of severe acute illness. 11 Given these limitations and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in hemodialysis patients is dependent on clinical epidemiology, radiographic findings, and viral nucleic acid testing.Lopinavir/ritonavir is a combination antiviral medicine used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection that 113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168   169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224 is metabolized by the liver. The active ingredient, lopinavir, is a protease inhibitor. 11 Because coronavirus replication requires the action of viral proteases, lopinavir/ ritonavir may be effective by binding to the coronavirus protease to inhibit viral replication. Previous studies 12, 13 have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV replication. Our results suggest that lopinavir/ ritonavir may improve the course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients receiving hemodialysis, although the lack of a control patient makes this conclusion somewhat subjective. Because of the liver clearance and higher protein-binding capacity of lopinavir/ritonavir, no dosing adjustments are necessary in the treatment of hemodialysis patients. 14 Given the likely immunosuppression and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions among dialysis patients, the hemodialysis population may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 pneumonia, making efforts to promptly identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and implement steps to limit the spread of the virus critical (Fig 2) . This begins with strengthening prescreening triage of hemodialysis patients. 5 Persons without face masks are not allowed to enter the hemodialysis ward. We also implemented a policy whereby it was mandated that the ""COVID-19 Pneumonia Screening Registration Form"" be completed (Box 1). All patients had their temperature checked at the entrance to the hemodialysis unit and were surveyed regarding any recent fever, cough, or exposure to epidemic areas or to individuals who have visited epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks. If available, particularly within epidemic areas, we suggest promptly assessing for SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid with swabs, especially in those with respiratory symptoms. For nonsuspected patients with potential COVID-19 exposure or from epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks, we performed hemodialysis in an isolation area within the hemodialysis facility. 225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280   281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318  319  320  321  322  323  324  325  326  327  328  329  330  331  332  333  334  335  336 All patients with temperatures > 37.3 C or respiratory symptoms were considered as suspected cases and were referred to the emergency department for evaluation. This assessment included routine serum chemistry tests and a complete blood count, C-reactive protein level, procalcitonin level, computed tomography of the chest and pharynx, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections. These suspected or confirmed cases were not brought into the dialysis treatment area, but rather were transferred to the isolation ward of the specialty hospital and received dialysis treatment in an isolation room until the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was negative.SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in most instances from person to person, either through inhalation or through deposition on mucosal surfaces of large respiratory droplets. Dialysis facility staff adhered to infection control measures recommended by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 15 including use of a waterproof disposable gown, cap, gloves, face shields, and an N95 face mask. After each hemodialysis treatment, the dialyzer and all blood tubing were discarded as infectious waste. The dialysis machine was disinfected using sodium hypochlorite solution according to the manufacturer's instruction. The dialysis machine was kept in a room in the COVID-19 isolation ward between dialysis sessions and was only used for patients who had contracted COVID-19 infection. Because of these rigorous practices by medical staff, they were allowed to continue to work and return home per their usual routines.In summary, we describe a hemodialysis patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. This particular patient had a relatively mild course despite multiple comorbid conditions including chronic hepatitis B virus infection and type 2 diabetes. With appropriate infection control measures, the staff who cared for this patient were not infected. Lopinavir/ritonavir therapy was used in this patient; whether this resulted in less severe disease remains uncertain but warrants further study. Last, through rigorous triage measures, we were able to limit the transmission of disease to other patients. 337  338  339  340  341  342  343  344  345  346  347  348  349  350  351  352  353  354  355  356  357  358  359  360  361  362  363  364  365  366  367  368  369  370  371  372  373  374  375  376  377  378  379  380  381  382  383  384  385  386  387  388  389  390  391  392   393  394  395  396  397  398  399  400  401  402  403  404  405  406  407  408  409  410  411  412  413  414  415  416  417  418  419  420  421  422  423  424  425  426  427  428  429  430  431  432  433  434  435  436  437  438  439  440  441  442  443  444  445  446  447  448  Case Report   449  450  451  452  453  454  455  456  457  458  459  460  461  462  463  464  465  466  467  468  469  470  471  472  473  474  475  476  477  478  479  480  481  482  483  484  485  486  487  488  489  490  491  492  493  494  495  496  497  498  499  500  501  502  503  504   505  506  507  508  509  510  511  512  513  514  515  516  517  518  519  520  521  522  523  524  525  526  527  528  529  530  531  532  533  534  535  536  537  538  539  540  541  542  543  544  545  546  547  548  549  550  551  552  553  554  555  556  557  558  559  560 "
6p23qxb8,"An emerging coronavirus causing pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China: calling for developing therapeutic and prophylactic strategies",". Both bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and ZXC21 were found in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolopus sinicus) in Zhoushan city of Zhejiang Province, China between 2015 and 2017 [3] , which can infect suckling rats and cause disease. Given that there were some bats and live animals in the seafood market, 2019-nCoV may be originated from bats or live animals exposure to the materials contaminated with bat droppings in the seafood market or surrounding area.The rapid identification of this novel coronavirus is attributed to recent advances in the detection of respiratory virus infection, including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and real-time RT-LAMP as well as multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays [4] . These methods are useful for detecting novel coronaviruses not only in humans, but also in animals for identification of animal reservoir or intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. WHO recommended that if there is no clue about the putative pathogen from the pneumonia outbreak, a pan-coronavirus assay should be used for amplification followed by sequencing of the amplicon for characterization and confirmation (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/ handle/10665/330374/WHO-2019-nCoV-laboratory-2020.1-eng.pdf). By aligning 2019-nCoV S protein sequence with those of SARS-CoV and several bat-SL-CoVs, we predicted that the cleavage site for generating S1 and S2 subunits is located at R694/S695 ( Figure 1 ). S1 subunit contains two functional domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), both of which are responsible for the binding of the virion to the receptor on the host cell. They also contain several conformational neutralizing epitopes, serving as a target for developing neutralizing antibodies and vaccines [5] . S2 subunit contains three functional domains, fusion peptide (FP), and heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2. After binding of RBD in S1 to the receptor, the S2 subunit changes conformation by inserting the FP into the host cell membrane and association between HR1 and HR2 to form six-helical bundle (6-HB), resulting in the fusion between viral and cellular membranes. The viral genetic materials enter into the host cell through the fusion pore for replication in the cell [5] . A peptide derived from the HR2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein (SC-1) can interact with HR1 region in viral S protein to form heterologous 6-HB, resulting in the inhibition of homologous 6-HB formation between HR1 and HR2 domains in viral S protein and thus blocking the viral fusion with the host cell [6] . Since 2019-nCoV S-HR2 sequence is 100% identical to that of SARS-CoV, while there are only a few mutations of non-critical amino acids in S-HR1 region, SC-1 peptide is expected to be also effective against 2019-nCoV infection.We have recently designed and engineered a pan-CoV fusion inhibitor, EK1 peptide, which could inhibit infection of five human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and three bat-SL-CoVs [7] . Intranasal application of EK1 peptide before or after viral challenge, EK1 peptide can protect human DPP4-transgenic mice from MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential prophylactic and therapeutic effect against 2019-nCoV infection. Once confirmed, we will develop EK1 peptide as a t prophylactic or therapeutic for intranasal application to prevent or treat infection by 2019-nCoV and other emerging coronaviruses in the future.The RBDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV contain multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes that induce more potent neutralizing antibodies and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, respectively, than other regions in S protein [5, 8, 9] . Modification of MERS-CoV S-RBD amino acid residues based on the structure design could improve its protection against MERS-CoV infection [9] , suggesting that 2019-nCoV S-RBD or modified S-RBD of other coronavirus may be applied for developing 2019-nCoV vaccines. Of course, the RBD-containing S and S1 of a coronavirus, e.g. 2019-nCoV, can also be used for vaccine development [8] .The recently developed SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and nanobodies with protective efficacy are specific to the S1 subunit of S protein, particularly the RBD [5, [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, the 2019-nCoV S-RBD is anticipated to be a key target for developing 2019-nCoV neutralizing mAbs. The neutralizing mAbs targeting non-RBD regions, including NTD and S2 of SARS-CoV and/or MERS-CoV S could also be identified [5, 8, 11, 12] , although their neutralizing potency is generally lower than that of RBD-specific mAbs.It may take several months or even years for researching and developing neutralizing antibodies against 2019-nCoV infection. One of the rapid approaches is to evaluate the currently available SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies with cross-neutralizing and protection activity against 2019-nCoV infection. We have shown that SARS-CoV S-RBD-specific neutralizing mAbs and sera could cross-neutralize bat-SL-CoVs, such as bat-SL-CoV-W1V1 and bat-SL-CoV-SHC014 [13] , suggesting that they may also cross-neutralize 2019-nCoV. Once identified, these cross-neutralizing antibodies can be promptly developed for urgent prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection."
rlpzejjt,The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade,"In 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting Humans has emerged in Wuhan, China. Its genome has been sequenced and the genomic information promptly released. Despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoVs, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site in the Spike protein of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like CoVs. In this article, we discuss the possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle, pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development of antivirals.Human coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, and are mostly responsible for upper respiratory and digestive tract infections. Among them SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that spread in 2002 and 2013 respectively, have been associated with severe human illnesses, such as severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and even meningitis in more vulnerable populations (de Wit et al., 2016) . In December 2019, a new CoV (2019-nCoV) has been detected in the city of Wuhan, and this emerging viral infection was associated with severe human respiratory disease with a~2-3% fatality rate . The virus that was presumed to have initially been transmitted from an animal reservoir to humans possibly via an amplifying host. However human-to-human transmission has been reported, leading to a sustained epidemic spread with > 31,000 confirmed human infections, including > 640 deaths, reported by the WHO in early February 2020. The estimated effective reproductive number (R) value of~2.90 (95%: 2.32-3.63) at the beginning of the outbreak raises the possibility of a pandemics . This prompted WHO to declare it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This is especially relevant because so far there are no specific antiviral treatments available or vaccine. Based on its genome sequence, 2019-nCoV belongs to lineage b of Betacoronavirus (Fig. 1A) , which also includes the SARS-CoV and bat CoV ZXC21, the latter and CoV ZC45 being the closest to 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCoV shares~76% amino acid sequence identity in the Spike (S)-protein sequence with SARS-CoV and 80% with CoV ZXC21 (Chan et al., 2020) . In this article, we focus on a specific furin-like protease recognition pattern present in the vicinity of one of the maturation sites of the S protein ( Fig. 1B ) that may have significant functional implications for virus entry.The proprotein convertases (PCs; genes PCSKs) constitute a family of nine serine secretory proteases that regulate various biological processes in both healthy and disease states (Seidah and Prat, 2012) . By proteolysis, PCs are responsible for the activation of a wide variety of precursor proteins, such as growth factors, hormones, receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as cell surface glycoproteins of infectious viruses (Seidah and Chretien, 1999) (Table 1) . Seven PCs cleave precursor proteins at specific single or paired basic amino acids (aa) within the motif (R/K)-(2X)n-(R/K)↓, where n = 0, 1, 2, or 3 spacer aa (Seidah and Chretien, 1999) . Because of their role in the processing of many critical cell surface proteins PCs, especially furin, have been implicated in viral infections. They have the potential to cleave specifically viral envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with host cell membranes (Izaguirre, 2019; Moulard and Decroly, 2000) . In the case of human-infecting coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 (Le Coupanec et al., 2015) , MERS-CoV (Millet and Whittaker, 2014) , and HKU1 (Chan et al., 2008) the spike protein has been demonstrated to be cleaved at an S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 2) generating the S1 and S2 subunits. The above three viruses display the canonical (R/K)-(2X)n-(R/K)↓ motif (Table 1) . Additionally, it has been demonstrated that variation around the viral envelope glycoprotein cleavage site plays a role in cellular tropism and pathogenesis. For instance, the pathogenesis of some CoV https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104742 Received 3 February 2020; Received in revised form 7 February 2020; Accepted 8 February 2020 has been previously related to the presence of a furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein sequence. For example, the insertion of a similar cleavage site in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S-protein results in higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism in infected chickens (Cheng et al., 2019) .Similarly, in the case of influenza virus, low-pathogenicity forms of influenza virus contain a single basic residue at the cleavage site, which is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases and the tissue distribution of the activating protease(s) typically restricts infections to the respiratory and/or intestinal organs (Sun et al., 2010) . Conversely, the highly pathogenic forms of influenza have a furin-like cleavage site cleaved by different cellular proteases, including furin, which are expressed in a wide variety of cell types allowing a widening of the cell tropism of the virus (Kido et al., 2012) . Furthermore the insertion of a multibasic motif RERRRKKR↓GL at the H5N1 hemagglutinin HA cleavage site was likely associated with the hyper-virulence of the virus during the Hong Kong 1997 outbreak (Claas et al., 1998) . This motif exhibits the critical Arg at P1 and basic residues at P2 and P4, as well as P6 and P8 and an aliphatic Leu at P2' positions (Table 1 ) (Schechter and Berger nomenclature (Schechter and Berger, 1968) ), typical of a furin-like cleavage specificity (Braun and Sauter, 2019; Izaguirre, 2019; Seidah and Prat, 2012) .The coronavirus S-protein is the structural protein responsible for the crown-like shape of the CoV viral particles, from which the original name ""coronavirus"" was coined. The~1200 aa long S-protein belongs to class-I viral fusion proteins and contributes to the cell receptor binding, tissue tropism and pathogenesis (Lu et al., 2015; Millet and Whittaker, 2014) . It contains several conserved domains and motifs Table 1 Comparative sequences of envelope protein cleavage site(s) in coronaviruses (above) and in other RNA viruses (below). Empty boxes: no consensus motif detected.. (Fig. 2) . The trimetric S-protein is processed at the S1/S2 cleavage site by host cell proteases, during infection. Following cleavage, also known as priming, the protein is divided into an N-terminal S1-ectodomain that recognises a cognate cell surface receptor and a C-terminal S2membrane-anchored protein involved in viral entry. The SARS-CoV S1protein contains a conserved Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), which recognises the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003) . The SARS-CoV binds to both bat and human cells, and the virus can infect both organisms (Ge et al., 2013; Kuhn et al., 2004) . The RBD surface of S1/ACE2 implicates 14 aa in the S1 of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) . Among them, 8 residues are strictly conserved in 2019-nCoV, supporting the hypothesis that ACE2 is also the receptor of the newly emerged nCoV (Wan et al., 2020) . The S2-protein contains the fusion peptide (FP), a second proteolytic site (S2′), followed by an internal fusion peptide (IFP) and two heptad-repeat domains preceding the transmembrane domain (TM) (Fig. 2) . Notably, the IFPs of the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are identical, displaying characteristics of viral fusion peptides (Fig. 2) . While the molecular mechanism involved in cell entry is not yet fully understood, it is likely that both FP and IFP participate in the viral entry process (Lu et al., 2015) and thus the Sprotein must likely be cleaved at both S1/S2 and S2′ cleavage sites for virus entry. The furin-like S2′ cleavage site at KR↓SF with P1 and P2 basic residues and a P2′ hydrophobic Phe (Seidah and Prat, 2012) , downstream of the IFP is identical between the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV (Fig. 2) . In the MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 the S1/S2 site is replaced by RXXR↓SA, with P1 and P4 basic residues, and an Ala (not aliphatic) at P2′, suggesting a somewhat less favourable cleavage by furin. However, in the other less pathogenic circulating human CoV, the S2′ cleavage site only exhibits a monobasic R↓S sequence (Fig. 2) with no basic residues at either P2 and/or P4 needed to allow furin cleavage, suggesting a less efficient cleavage or higher restriction at the entry step depending on the cognate proteases expressed by target cells. Even though processing at S2′ in 2019-nCoV is expected to be a key event for the final activation of the S-protein, the protease(s) involved in this process have not yet been conclusively identified. Based on the 2019-nCoV S2′ sequence and the above arguments, we propose that one or more furin-like enzymes would cleave the S2′ site at KR↓SF. In contrast to the S2′, the first cleavage between the RBD and the FP (S1/S2 cleavage site, Fig. 2 ) has been extensively studied for many CoVs (Lu et al., 2015) . Interestingly the S1/S2 processing site exhibits different motifs among coronaviruses (Fig. 2 , site 1 & site 2), with many of them displaying cleavage after a basic residue. It is thus likely that the priming process is ensured by different host cell proteases depending on the sequence of the S1/S2 cleavage site. Accordingly the MERS-CoV Sprotein, which contains a RSVR↓SV motif is cleaved during virus egress, probably by furin (Mille and Whittaker, 2014) . Conversely the Sprotein of SARS-CoV remains largely uncleaved after biosynthesis, possibly due to the lack of a favourable furin-like cleavage site (SLLR-ST). In this case, it was reported that following receptor binding the Sprotein is cleaved at a conserved sequence AYT↓M (located 10 aa downstream of SLLR-ST) by target cells' proteases such as elastase, cathepsin L or TMPRSS2 (Bosch et al., 2008; Matsuyama et al., 2010 Matsuyama et al., , 2005 Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . As the priming event is essential for virus entry, the efficacy and extent of this activation step by the proteases of the target cells should regulate cellular tropism and viral pathogenesis. In the case of the 2019-nCoV S-protein, the conserved site 2 sequence AYT↓M may still be cleaved, possibly after the preferred furincleavage at the site 1 (Fig. 2) .Since furin is highly expressed in lungs, an enveloped virus that infects the respiratory tract may successfully exploit this convertase to activate its surface glycoprotein (Bassi et al., 2017; Mbikay et al., 1997) . Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses. However, it is shared by other CoV (HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, MHV-A59) harbouring furin-like cleavage sites in their S-protein ( Fig. 2; Table 1 ), which were shown to be processed by furin experimentally (Le Coupanec et al., . The SP, S1↓S2 and S2′ cleavage sites are indicated by arrows. The sequence of different CoV S1/S2 and S2′ cleavage sites were aligned using Multalin webserver (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/) with manual adjustments and the figure prepared using ESPript 3 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/) presenting the secondary structure of SARS-CoV S-protein at the bottom of the alignment (PDB 5X58) (Yuan et al., 2017) . Insertion of furin like cleavage site is surrounded by a black frame. Red asterisks indicate the presence of a canonical furin-like cleavage motif at the S1/S2 site. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) 2015; Mille and Whittaker, 2014) . Strikingly, the 2019-nCoV S-protein sequence contains 12 additional nucleotides upstream of the single Arg↓ cleavage site 1 (Figs. 1B and 2) leading to a predictively solventexposed PRRAR↓SV sequence, which corresponds to a canonical furinlike cleavage site (Braun and Sauter, 2019; Izaguirre, 2019; Seidah and Prat, 2012) . This furin-like cleavage site, is supposed to be cleaved during virus egress (Mille and Whittaker, 2014) for S-protein ""priming"" and may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other lineage b betacoronaviruses. This possibly illustrates a convergent evolution pathway between unrelated CoVs. Interestingly, if this site is not processed, the S-protein is expected to be cleaved at site 2 during virus endocytosis, as observed for the SARS-CoV.Obviously much more work is needed to demonstrate experimentally our assertion, but the inhibition of such processing enzyme(s) may represent a potential antiviral strategy. Indeed, it was recently shown that in an effort to limit viral infections, host cells that are infected by a number of viruses provoke an interferon response to inhibit the enzymatic activity of furin-like enzymes. It was also demonstrated that HIV infection induces the expression of either the protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) (Kim et al., 2015) or guanylate binding proteins 2 and 5 (GBP2,5) (Braun and Sauter, 2019 ) that restrict the trafficking of furin to the trans Golgi network (PAR1) or to early Golgi compartments (GBP2,5) where the proprotein convertase remains inactive. Altogether, these observations suggest that inhibitors of furin-like enzymes may contribute to inhibiting virus propagation.A variety of approaches have been proposed to inhibit furin activity to limit tumour growth, viral and bacterial infection. Thus, a variant of the naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor α-1 antitrypsin harbouring a consensus furin cleavage, called α-1 antitrypsin Portland (α1-PDX), inhibits furin and prevents the processing of HIV-1 Env (Anderson et al., 1993) . The addition of a chloromethylketone (CMK) moiety to the C-terminus of a polybasic cleavage motif and a decanoyl group at the N-terminus to favour cell penetration (dec-RVKR-cmk) irreversibly blocked the enzymatic activity of furin, PC7, PC5, PACE4 and PC7 (Decroly et al., 1996; Garten et al., 1994) . Finally, the elucidation of the crystal structure of furin resulted in the design of a 2,5dideoxystreptamine-derived inhibitor, where two molecules of the inhibitor form a complex with furin (Dahms et al., 2017) . As furin-like enzymes are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, one important issue would be to avoid systemic inhibition that may result in some toxicity. Accordingly, it is likely that such small molecule inhibitors, or other more potent orally active ones, possibly delivered by inhalation and exhibiting a slow dissociation rate from furin to allow for sustained inhibition, deserve to be rapidly tested to assess their antiviral effect against 2019-nCoV."
0xhho1sh,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): The epidemic and the challenges,"Since the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] , it has rapidly spread across China and many other countries [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . So far, 2019-nCoV has affected more than 43 0 0 0 patients in 28 countries/regions and has became a major global health concern ( https: //www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/ 20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9 _ 4 ). On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease . Regarding the virus itself, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the previously provisionally named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] .Although early studies reported a link between a single local fish and wild animal market and most cases of infection, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission, studies have increasingly demonstrated human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through droplets or direct contact [2 , 8-10] . Moreover, according to one study, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients [8] . Based on the evidence of a rapidly increasing incidence of infections [11] and the possibility of transmission by asymptomatic carriers [12] , SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted effectively among humans and exhibits high potential February 20, 2020; 7:4 ] for a pandemic [5 , 10 , 13] . In addition to the high transmission efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, the advancement and convenience of global travel could further enhance its worldwide spread [12] . On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern, following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019). Therefore, health workers, governments and the public need to co-operate globally to prevent its spread [14] .In addition to seasonal influenza, reported pathogens of pneumonia include adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus A/B [15] [16] [17] [18] . Moreover, these viruses can cause co-infection in the setting of communityacquired bacterial pneumonia [16] [17] [18] . Using molecular methods, knowledge about the role of these viruses in the setting of pneumonia has achieved significant advancements [19] [20] [21] . SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus [22] [23] [24] . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (88-89% similarity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession no. MG772933.1 ) and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank accession no. MG772934.1 ), but it is more distant from SARS-CoV (~79% similarity) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (~50% similarity) [23 , 25 , 26] . Chen et al . applied an RNA-based metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing approach to identify a human coronavirus from two pneumonia cases during the Wuhan outbreak in 2019 [27] . Its entire genome was 29 881 bp in length [27] . Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the coronavirus circulating in Rhinolophus (horseshoe bats), with 98.7% nucleotide similarity to the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) gene of the bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546 , 370 bp sequence of RdRp ) and 87.9% nucleotide similarity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S and N genes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely a novel coronavirus that was independently introduced from animals to humans [27] . Based on the findings of genomic investigations and the presence of some bats and live animals in the seafood market in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats or bat droppings associated with contaminated materials in the market or surrounding region [25 , 28] .Based on observations of data from the early outbreak in mainland China from 10-24 January 2020, the trend of an increasing incidence largely follows exponential growth, and the mean basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) was estimated to range from 2.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-2.55] to 3.58 (95% CI 2.89-4.39), associated with two-to eight-fold increases in the reporting rate [11] . Another estimation based on data from 31 December 2019 to 28 January 2020 suggested similar findings, with the R 0 for COVID-19 being 2.68 [95% credible interval (CrI) 2.47-2.86] and the epidemic doubling time being 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1 days) [29] . The current estimate of the mean incubation period for COVID-19 is 6.4 days, ranging from 2.1 days to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) [30] , with potential asymptomatic transmission. Although the situation is evolving and further updated data are required to confirm these estimations, there is great potential for a large outbreak of COVID-19 soon.As of 11 February 2020, data from the WHO showed that there were a total of 43 103 cases of COVID-19 ( Figs 1 and 2 ) ( https: //www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/ 20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9 _ 4 ). There has been a steady rise in the daily total number of COVID-19 cases globally, both within and outside China ( Fig. 1 ) . Regarding new cases of COVID-19, a declining trend was found globally ( Fig. 2 A) , in China but not outside China ( Fig. 2 B) , mainly in international conveyance (Japan) on 11 February 2020. Twenty-eight countries/regions have reported confirmed cases, including mainland China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the USA, Macao SAR, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, France, the Philippines, the UK, Italy, India, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Nepal, Spain and Belgium. China has had the largest number of patients with COVID-19 ( n = 42 690), followed by Singapore ( n = 45) ( Fig. 3 A) . Asia has had most of the reported cases, followed by Europe, North America and Australia, but no cases have been reported in Africa. Within China, Hubei has endured the largest number of infected patients ( n = 31 728), followed by Guangdong ( n = 1177), Zhejiang ( n = 1117) and Henan ( n = 1105) ( Fig. 3 B) . A total of 1017 mortalities have been reported globally, with only 2 mortalities occurring outside of mainland China, one each in Hong Kong SAR and the Philippines. According to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control ( https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En ), as of 12 February 2020 there were 45 167 cases of COVID-19 reported from 28 countries/region and 1115 (2.5%) of patients had died. Among the 45 167 cases, most were found in mainland China ( n = 44 653) and the reported mortality was 2.5% ( n = 1113).As of 10 February 2020, only three relatively large-scale case studies have thoroughly demonstrated the clinical features of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia) in Wuhan [4 , 5 , 8] . Herein, we summarise the clinical manifestations of the 278 pooled patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is also referred to as novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia ( Table 1 ) . All of the patients were adults older than 18 years of age, and males comprised 61.9% of the patients ( n = 172). A recent study in Beijing reported that 2 of the 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were children aged between 2-15 years [9] . As of 10 February 2020, more than 20 paediatric cases have been reported in China, 10 of whom were identified in Zhejiang Province and were in the age range of 112 days to 17 years [31] . Among adult patients, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were the most common underlying diseases, followed by diabetes mellitus. Fever was the most common symptom (92.8%; n = 258), followed by cough (69.8%; n = 194), dyspnoea (34.5%; n = 96), myalgia (27.7%; n = 77), headache (7.2%; n = 20) and diarrhoea (6.1%; n = 17). Rhinorrhoea was noted in only 4.0% [4] , a sore throat in 5.1% [4] and pharyngalgia in 17.4% [8] of patients with relevant clinical information. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count, but 56.8% ( n = 158) of patients had leukopenia. In one study, patients requiring intensive care were significantly older and more likely to have underlying diseases [8] , but another study showed different findings [5] . According to two studies, patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were more likely to have dyspnoea than non-ICU patients [5 , 8] . Among the 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia reported in Beijing, 12 (92.3%) had fever with a mean duration of 1.6 days before hospitalisation [9] . Other symptoms included cough (46.3%), upper airway congestion (61.5%), myalgia (23.1%) and headache (23.1%) [9] . Although some of the epidemiological characteristics were identified, considerable uncertainties are still present and additional studies are needed with detailed information from confirmed cases [32] . Radiological findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are variable. More than 75% of patients presented with bilateral lung involvement [4 , 5 , 8 , 32] , and multilobe involvement was also common (71%) [33] . Ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the most common finding from chest computed tomography (CT) [8 , 34] , and in a series of 21 patients, 86% had GGO on chest CT and 29% showed consolidation [33] . Approximately one-third of patients showed a peripheral distribution of GGO. In contrast, no discrete nodules, cavitation, pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy were observed on the chest CT images [33 , 34] . Another study including 51 cases showed similar findings [35] : most CT images showed pure GGO (77%), followed by GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening (75%), GGO with consolidation (59%) and pure consolidation (55%). Of the 51 cases, 86% showed bilateral lung involvement, and the above findings were peripherally distributed in 86% of cases [35] .According to recent reports [4 , 5 , 8] , > 85% of patients received antiviral agents, including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h orally), ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 h intravenously) and lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (40 0/10 0 mg twice daily orally). Empirical antibiotics were prescribed for 90% of patients in three reports [4 , 5 , 8] according to one study 15 patients (15%) received antifungal agents [4] . Five cases (5.1%) of bacterial ( n = 1) or Candida ( n = 4) coinfections were reported among 99 patients in one study [4] , and 4 cases (9.8%) of secondary bacterial infections were reported in another study of 41 patients [5] ( Table 2 ) . Although intravenous immunoglobulin and systemic steroids have been used in several reports [4 , 5 , 8] , their efficacy and associated adverse effects remain unclear. So far, there has been no effective treatment of COVID-19. Several potential drug candidates, including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra R ), nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (Arbidol R ), DNA synthesis inhibitors (such as tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine), chloroquine and Chinese traditional medicines (such as ShuFeng JieDu or Lianhua Qingwen capsules), have been proposed [36 , 37] . In addition, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-based peptide, 3CLpro inhibitor (3CLpro-1) and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor, theoretically, appear to show potential for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 [38] . Chloroquine has been well described with in vitro effects on inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of posttranslational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation in many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [39] . Preliminary in vivo clinical studies suggest that chloroquine alone or in combination February 20, 2020; 7:4 ] with antiretroviral agents might play an interesting role in treating HIV infection [39] . A recent study by Wang et al. revealed that remdesivir and chloroquine were highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV in vitro [37] . In addition to the one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a promising clinical response to remdesivir [7] and two clinical trials in China, further case-controlled clinical studies of remdesivir therapy are warranted to verify its therapeutic efficacy.In the three pooled studies of 278 patients [4 , 5 , 8] , 72 patients (25.9%) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required ICU admission, 56 (20.1%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 23 (8.3%) and 9 (3.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia, respectively ( Table 2 ). Shock was observed in 19 patients (6.8%), acute kidney injury in 11 patients (4.0%) and continuous renal replacement therapy was required in 14 patients (5.0%). Acute cardiac injury was reported in 5 patients (12.2%) in one study [5] and 10 patients (7.2%) in another study [8] . Although two earlier studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was associated with high mortality rates of 11.1% ( n = 11) [4] and 14.6% ( n = 6) [5] , one recent study showed a mortality rate of 4.3% ( n = 6) [8] ( Table 2 ) . Among 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia outside of Wuhan, as of 4 February 2020 all of the patients recovered but 12 were still being quarantined in hospital in Beijing [9] . It might be suggested that the real-world mortality rate may be lower than that reported in a few published clinical series, when clinical data from more systematic testing would be available, and as the ratio between fatality cases and total reported cases of COVID-19 on 12 February 2020 was currently 0.025 (mortality rate 2.5%). However, most deaths developed in male and elderly patients [4 , 40] . The median number of days from the appearance of the first symptom to death was 14 days, and it was significantly shorter among patients aged ≥70 years (11.5 days) compared with those aged < 70 years (20 days) ( P = 0.033) [40] .To decrease the damage associated with COVID-19, public health and infection control measures are urgently required to limit the global spread of the virus [35] . Experience from the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia strongly highlighted that travel history, rather than chest radiography, is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases [41] . It is essential to limit human-to-human transmission in order to reduce secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers and to prevent transmission amplification events and further international spread from China. Based on previous experience of management of MERS and SARS infections, the WHO recommend infection control interventions to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand-washing especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment, and avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Moreover, people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette, which is to maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands, and within healthcare facilities enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices are recommended in hospitals, especially in emergency departments [42] . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established interim clinical guidance for the COVID-19 outbreak to implement aggressive measures to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA [43] . These measures include identification of cases and their contacts in the USA as well as appropriate assessment and care of travellers arriving from mainland China to the USA [43] . All effort s are being made to slow the spread of the illness in order to provide time to better prepare healthcare systems and the general public, to better characterise COVID-19 to guide public-health recommendations, and to develop timely diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines [43] . Finally, although the improvement of internet communication largely enhances the availability and dissemination of knowledge, the internet also has the potential for the development and spread of misinformation or fake news. Governments should be responsible for providing accurate knowledge and clarifying misinformation to help the public face this novel infection.Despite the whole world's effort s to underst and COVID-19, many issues remain unclear. First, one report has demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stools [7] . However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the faecal-oral route remains unclear. Second, previous studies showed that SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses could survive on environmental surfaces and inanimate objects [44 , 45] ; however, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment has not been reported. Previous studies have shown that coronaviruses could be efficiently inactivated using surface disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min, but other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate were less effective [45] . However, current investigation of the efficacy of commonly used disinfection agents against SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Third, although travel restriction was exerted in many countries, whether this intervention was effective is unclear. Fourth, although one case responded well to remdesivir [7] and one in vitro study [37] showed that remdesivir and chloroquine were promising for the treatment of COVID-19, further clinical trials on the effectiveness of remdesivir and chloroquine for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia should be conducted. Fifth, although several studies have reported the clinical features of COVID-19 [4 , 5 , 8 , 9] , all of the patients had pneumonia and were treated in Wuhan and Beijing. Most recently, an article has described 1099 patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by SARS-CoV-2 treated at 552 hospitals across 31 provinces/provincial municipalities in China [46] . The article reported that only 43.8% of patients had a initial presentation of fever, and severe pneumonia occurred in 15.7% of cases. The study indicated the median incubation period to be 3.0 days (range, 0-24.0 days) and the fatality rate to be only 1.36% [46] . However, further evaluation of the content of the above report is warranted to clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic carriers and of ARD and pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, although 32.4% ( n = 90) of the reported 278 cases with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia received systemic steroid therapy [4 , 5 , 8] , a study on the temporal features of the SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions is lacking. Previous experiences of systemic steroids in the treatment of coronavirus-related infections, such as SARS and MERS, showed disappointing results. In the interim, clinical use of glucocorticoids to control SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with the intention of regulating cytokine production and the inflammatory response and avoiding lung injury should be avoided [47 , 48] .The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers worldwide. However, February 20, 2020; 7:4 ] knowledge about this novel virus remains limited. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. What we can do now is aggressively implement infection control measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via human-to-human transmission. Public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation, as the more we learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreaks, the better we can respond.Funding: None."
pyeb86on,Q&A: The novel coronavirus outbreak causing COVID-19,"The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses. At 125 nm, it is slightly larger than influenza, SARS and MERS viruses. It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1] .The near identical gene sequences of 90 analysed cases from outside of China suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early December 2019 from an unknown (likely mammalian) intermediate host [2] . Pangolins are an endangered ant-eating mammal from which scientists in Guangzhou have shown a coronavirus with 99% homology, with a receptor binding domain identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been confirmed, and, in addition, the pangolin's rarity means this may not be the only mammal involved.The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, sore throat and diarrhoea. On February 14th, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) published the first details of 44,672 confirmed cases, in the biggest study since the outbreak began [3] . Their findings show that COVID-19 was mild for 81% of patients and had an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. Of those confirmed cases, only 2.2% were under 20 years old. Compared to adults, children generally present with much milder clinical symptoms. It is likely that future serological studies will show much asymptomatic disease in children. As opposed to H1N1, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. The severity of the disease appears to be associated with age, with the elderly most at risk; those over 80 years of age had a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 14.8%. The CFR was also increased in those with comorbidities including cardiovascular, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. The cause of death is respiratory failure, shock or multiple organ failure.There is no proven treatment at this early stage but we will doubtless have more information about this soon. It can be assumed that non-pharmacologic approaches are effective such as fluid support, oxygen and ventilatory support. Most recently the national data suggests that 17.7%, 10.4% and 7.0% of all cases have disease requiring respiratory support in Wuhan, Hubei (not including Wuhan) and the rest of China (respectively). About a quarter of all require ventilation while 75% require oxygen support only. The variation in severity rates probably reflects the outcomes in an overwhelmed health system. Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill. ECMO is currently being used in China, however, its effectiveness is yet to be determined. Antiviral drugs as well as a variety of other putative treatments are typically being prescribed for deteriorating patients on a compassionate basis. Clinicians would be well aware of such situations but assurance is required that their safety and efficacy are being scientifically assessed so that meaning is brought to bear quickly. Coordination of clinical trials to avoid duplication and ensure that results are rapidly available will be a challenge but the case numbers should facilitate rapid definitive results. (see What is in the pipeline for vaccine development and/or therapeutics?).As a novel virus newly emerged in humans, the world's population is completely immune-naïve and therefore vulnerable. There is clear human-to-human transmission in family clusters in China and beyond, transmission from close face-to-face social contact, especially in small enclosed spaces, and transmission from failed infection prevention and control measures in health facilities. In addition, the experience in Wuhan shows that transmission can be massive in a short period of time with thousands of new patients diagnosed daily.The current aim of the global response is to flatten the epidemic curve so that transmission is slowed, and to interrupt transmission where possible. While there is clearly a mortality linked to the virus, the most concerning problem will be if a health system is overwhelmed in the wake of rapid transmission so that affected patients cannot receive the care they need. Furthermore, patients with other urgent medical conditions are at risk of not obtaining their necessary care. Countries with vulnerable health systems are particularly of concern.Recently, there have been outbreaks in newly affected countries including Italy and Iran where the index case is unidentified. Furthermore affected countries have very large clusters emerging such as Korea and Japan. There is no reason to believe that the global community is ready for this emerging pandemic; ready in a way that can see drastic public health intervention implemented within days, including aggressive and massive contact tracing, monitoring (or quarantine) and early detection and isolation in an attempt to slow the progression.There is uncertainty regarding transmissibility and severitymore information is emerging about the spectrum of disease, especially mild disease, which is not identified using many current case definitions, and about the ease of transmission from person to person. Health agencies are unsure how to model this and estimates vary depending on the variables being used. For instance, SARS was essentially spread later in the disease from patients with more significant clinical pictures, and it was contained by infection control measures particularly in hospitals. The limited spread to family members of health workers and the community was contained by usual outbreak control measures including early identification and management of persons with infection, tracing of contacts with monitoring for onset of fever and/or symptoms, and active engagement of communities.Most modelling suggests that the severity of illness is more like influenza than SARS, and there is concern among the public health community because the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood, and the potential for it to become endemic like other respiratory pathogens is unknown.Because of the many unknowns, the initial reaction by health agencies is still valid: to brace for the first wave as the virus reaches a completely naïve population and to make maximum effort to interrupt transmission [4, 5] .Experience with managing this outbreak will be very heterogenous across the world. Countries closely connected with China, such as Singapore, will be ahead in this regard. As the outbreak moves across regions, there is opportunity to support those affected later both in terms of readiness and response. Mechanisms available to outbreak response organisations, particularly through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), can be valuable in skills-and knowledgesharing. Therefore, there should be a deliberate effort to utilise knowledge from early affected countries in later affected countries.What measures are likely to be successful in curbing its further spread?On January 23rd, Hubei province in Central China was locked down with all movement in and out of the province blocked. Travel across China was discouraged and the number of scheduled flights and train journeys available considerably reduced to perhaps 10% of previous activity. Commercial and social activities became negligible, with schools, restaurants, other entertainment spots and most shops closed. Migrant workers were prevented from returning to work after the extended Chinese New Year Holiday. Frequent hand hygiene when in public and staying at home became the norm. This unprecedented public health effort by China has afforded the rest China and the world a lead time to prepare. The lockdown resulted in a downward trend in national and provincial epidemic curves, however, these measures are not sustainable and eventually there will be a strategy to return to normality. Should this result in a second wave of cases, and more international spread, countries around the world must be prepared. Early identification, and isolation or cohorting of positive cases to designated sites is at the core. In order to achieve this, hospitals, quarantine services, laboratories, together with epidemiology and communication teams will need to be scaled up to provide effective and efficient care.What is in the pipeline for vaccine development and/or therapeutics?It appears that no vaccine will be available for at least one year, likely a little longer. Phase 1 trials for safety and immunogenicity in human populations are likely within 3 months.In terms of therapeutics there is no known effective pharmaceutical agent. There are over 200 registered clinical trials registered in China alone. Putative agents include antivirals; Griffithsin, a spike protein inhibitor, nucleoside analogues eg. remdesivir, ribavirin and protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Immunomodulatory and other host targeted agents include interferon, chloroquine and immunoglobulins. Corticosteroids will potentially have benefit for immune mediated lung damage late in the course of disease [6] . Much of the theory stems from what we have learnt from limited trials in other corona viruses [7] .The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses. At 125 nm, it is slightly larger than influenza, SARS and MERS viruses. It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1] .The near identical gene sequences of 90 analysed cases from outside of China suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early December 2019 from an unknown (likely mammalian) intermediate host [2] . Pangolins are an endangered ant-eating mammal from which scientists in Guangzhou have shown a coronavirus with 99% homology, with a receptor binding domain identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been confirmed, and, in addition, the pangolin's rarity means this may not be the only mammal involved.The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, sore throat and diarrhoea. On February 14th, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) published the first details of 44,672 confirmed cases, in the biggest study since the outbreak began [3] . Their findings show that COVID-19 was mild for 81% of patients and had an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. Of those confirmed cases, only 2.2% were under 20 years old. Compared to adults, children generally present with much milder clinical symptoms. It is likely that future serological studies will show much asymptomatic disease in children. As opposed to H1N1, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. The severity of the disease appears to be associated with age, with the elderly most at risk; those over 80 years of age had a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 14.8%. The CFR was also increased in those with comorbidities including cardiovascular, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. The cause of death is respiratory failure, shock or multiple organ failure.There is no proven treatment at this early stage but we will doubtless have more information about this soon. It can be assumed that non-pharmacologic approaches are effective such as fluid support, oxygen and ventilatory support. Most recently the national data suggests that 17.7%, 10.4% and 7.0% of all cases have disease requiring respiratory support in Wuhan, Hubei (not including Wuhan) and the rest of China (respectively). About a quarter of all require ventilation while 75% require oxygen support only. The variation in severity rates probably reflects the outcomes in an overwhelmed health system. Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill. ECMO is currently being used in China, however, its effectiveness is yet to be determined. Antiviral drugs as well as a variety of other putative treatments are typically being prescribed for deteriorating patients on a compassionate basis. Clinicians would be well aware of such situations but assurance is required that their safety and efficacy are being scientifically assessed so that meaning is brought to bear quickly. Coordination of clinical trials to avoid duplication and ensure that results are rapidly available will be a challenge but the case numbers should facilitate rapid definitive results. (see What is in the pipeline for vaccine development and/or therapeutics?).As a novel virus newly emerged in humans, the world's population is completely immune-naïve and therefore vulnerable. There is clear human-to-human transmission in family clusters in China and beyond, transmission from close face-to-face social contact, especially in small enclosed spaces, and transmission from failed infection prevention and control measures in health facilities. In addition, the experience in Wuhan shows that transmission can be massive in a short period of time with thousands of new patients diagnosed daily.The current aim of the global response is to flatten the epidemic curve so that transmission is slowed, and to interrupt transmission where possible. While there is clearly a mortality linked to the virus, the most concerning problem will be if a health system is overwhelmed in the wake of rapid transmission so that affected patients cannot receive the care they need. Furthermore, patients with other urgent medical conditions are at risk of not obtaining their necessary care. Countries with vulnerable health systems are particularly of concern.Recently, there have been outbreaks in newly affected countries including Italy and Iran where the index case is unidentified. Furthermore affected countries have very large clusters emerging such as Korea and Japan. There is no reason to believe that the global community is ready for this emerging pandemic; ready in a way that can see drastic public health intervention implemented within days, including aggressive and massive contact tracing, monitoring (or quarantine) and early detection and isolation in an attempt to slow the progression.There is uncertainty regarding transmissibility and severitymore information is emerging about the spectrum of disease, especially mild disease, which is not identified using many current case definitions, and about the ease of transmission from person to person. Health agencies are unsure how to model this and estimates vary depending on the variables being used. For instance, SARS was essentially spread later in the disease from patients with more significant clinical pictures, and it was contained by infection control measures particularly in hospitals. The limited spread to family members of health workers and the community was contained by usual outbreak control measures including early identification and management of persons with infection, tracing of contacts with monitoring for onset of fever and/or symptoms, and active engagement of communities.Most modelling suggests that the severity of illness is more like influenza than SARS, and there is concern among the public health community because the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood, and the potential for it to become endemic like other respiratory pathogens is unknown.Because of the many unknowns, the initial reaction by health agencies is still valid: to brace for the first wave as the virus reaches a completely naïve population and to make maximum effort to interrupt transmission [4, 5] .Experience with managing this outbreak will be very heterogenous across the world.

b31ctbat,Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 10% 1, 2 (MERS-CoV) broke out in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35% 3, 4 . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, and their hosts are bat/civet and dromedary, respectively 5, 6 . To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Therefore, CoVs are considered to be a kind of viruses, of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans. Because Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019, the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or ""2019-nCoV"" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020 7, 8 . Since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous with SARS-CoV, it is considered a close relative of SARS-CoV. TheInternational Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified 2019-nCoV as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020. At the same time, WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV as COVID-19. Common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. There is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 9 .CoVs are enveloped viruses with a positive RNA genome, belonging to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales, which are divided into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β genus.CoVs contain at least four structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 10 . Among them, Spike promotes host attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion during virus infection. Therefore, Spike determines to some extent the host range.Potential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target, one is acting on the human immune system or human cells, and the other is on coronavirus itself. In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response 11 .Blocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect.In addition, viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells, for example, the SARS virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [12] [13] [14] and the MERS binds to the DPP4 receptor 15, 16 . The therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral RNA through acting on the genetic material of the virus, inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus, and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the virus's self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins.In the fight against coronavirus, scientists have come up with three strategies for developing new drugs 17 .The first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals 18 . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too ""broad-spectrum"" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.Theoretically, the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects, but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years, or even more than 10 years 11 .For the development of medicines treating SARS-CoV-2, the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs. Once the efficacy is determined, it can be approved by the Green Channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients. Herein, bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted, and the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc. Further, we used these proteins and human relative proteins [human ACE2 and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) enzymes] as targets to screen ZINC U. S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug database (ZINC drug database, ZDD), our own database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine), and the database of commonly used anti-viral drugs (78 compounds) by virtual ligand screening method. This study predicts a variety of compounds that may inhibit novel coronaviruses and provides scientists with information on compounds that may be effective. Subsequent validation of anti-viral effects in vitro and in vivo will provide useful information for clinical treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.The complete genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) was downloaded from NCBI nucleotide database. The nucleotide sequences were aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes (Alogorithm parameters, max target sequences: 1000, expect threshold: 10). We obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Gene Bank. The genome sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 was aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes. After phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species. We found three coronaviruses from bat (96%, 88% and 88% for Bat-Cov RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC12 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively) have the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, as shown in Fig is helicase. As a new coronavirus, structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage. Until now, only one crystal structure of 3CLpro has been deposited in PDB (pdb code: 6LU7).In order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening, we aligned all protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 with all sequences in PDB1018 database in Fold & Function Assignment System (Supporting Information Figs. S19-S34). Fortunately, most of these proteins have found their high homology proteins that have three-dimensional structure, with homology between 72%-99% (Supporting Information Table S1 ). Those PDB codes were labeled below the corresponding sequences in Fig. 2B . Unsurprisingly, all these proteins with the highest homology are from SARS. Nevertheless, there are some proteins still have not high homologous in the database. After the prediction of transmembrane helices in these proteins carried out in TMHMM Server, as expected, we found that all these proteins are transmembrane proteins except for Nsp2 (Supporting Information Figs. S35-S41). So far, we have found as much structural information of this viral proteins as possible, which provides the basis for subsequent homology modeling and drug screening. Before homology modeling, all these proteins sequences were aligned with model sequences derived from SARS-CoV and predicted secondary structure as the same time ( Fig. 3A and Table S1 ). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3A , important anti-virus drug target protein like 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp are highly conserved between those two human coronaviruses, especially in functional region. As shown in Table S1 , all these potential drug target proteins have been homologously modeled, and all generated protein models were provided as the PDB files in Supporting Information. All other coordinates of target-screening hit complexes can be provided upon request.In order to verify the accuracy of homologous modeling, we aligned the computational structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that modeled from the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with its crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (6LU7) just solved and released during this manuscript was being prepared. sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is 76% (Fig. 3C ). Recent researches speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could also bind to ACE2, and this was verified by computational docking and ELISA measurement 24, 25 . Moreover, homology of the Spike-RBD sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoVRaTG13 is as high as 95%. Despite the high homology of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 in Spike sequence, our analysis found that four among the five most important amino acids (L465, L495, Y502, D510, and H514) that bind to ACE2 12 in Bat-CoV RaTG13 differ from SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 3C ). And there is no related research literature about whether Bat-CoV RaTG13 can infect human yet. We also performed homology modeling on the Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike RBD (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ). Three Spike RBD structures have been docked with human ACE2. Among them, for the conformations which most resemble the crystal structure of SARS RBD-ACE2 complex 26 , the binding free energy between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and human ACE2 was -33.72 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S2 ), that between SARS-CoV Spike RBD and ACE2 was -49.22 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S3 ), and that between Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike RBD and ACE2 was -31.06 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S4 ).The therapies that act on the coronavirus can be divided into several categories based on the specific pathways:(1) some acting on enzymes or functional proteins that are critical to virus, preventing the virus RNA synthesis and replication; (2) some acting on structural proteins of virus, blocking virus from binding to human cell receptors, or inhibiting the virus's self-assembly process; (3) some producing virulence factor to restore host's innate immunity; (4) some acting on host's specific receptors or enzymes, preventing virus from entering into host's cells. The related target proteins include Nsp1, Nsp3 (Nsp3b, Nsp3c, PLpro, and Nsp3e), Based on homology models of the above 18 viral proteins (19 models) and 2 human targets, we resorted to structure-based virtual ligand screening method using ICM 3.7.3 modeling software (MolSoft LLC) to screen potential small-molecule compounds from a ZINC Drug Database (2924 compounds) and a small in-house database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine) and derivatives (1066 compounds). Compounds with lower calculated binding energies (being expressed with scores and mfScores) are considered to have higher binding affinities with the target protein.As PLpro is responsible for the cleavages of N-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3, which is essential for correcting virus replication 27 .PLpro was also confirmed to be significant to antagonize the host's innate immunity [28] [29] [30] . As an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host, PLpro has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors. It is very valuable for targeting PLpro to treat coronavirus infections, but no inhibitor has been approved by the FDA for marketing.The screening results (Table 1 and Anti-viral drug ribavirin was predicted to bind to PLpro with low binding energy (Scores=-38.58). From generated docking model, ribavirin was bound in the active site of the enzyme as reported SARS-PLpro inhibitors (PDB code 3e9s). Hydrogen bonds were predicted between Gly164, Gln270, Tyr274, Asp303 and the compound. Also, π-π stacking was found between Tyr265 and triazolering in the compound ( Fig. 4A and B). The strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between ribavirin with the enzyme imply it may be a potent PLpro inhibitor.The 3CLpro, also known as Nsp5, is first automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then further cleaves downstream Nsps at 11 sites to release Nsp4-Nsp16 31 . 3CLpro directly mediates the maturation of Nsps, which is essential in the life cycle of the virus. The detailed investigation on the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro makes 3CLpro an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug development. Inhibitors targeting at SARS-CoV 3CLpro mainly include peptide inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors [32] .3CLpro monomer has three domains, domain I (residues 8-101), domain II (residues 102-184) anddomain III (residues 201-303), and a long loop (residues 185-200) connects domains II and III. The active site of 3CLpro is located in the gap between domains I and II, and has a CysHis catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) 33 . As shown in Table 3 and Supporting excel file 3CLpro.xlsx), anti-bacterial drugs (lymecycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline and oxytetracycline), anti-hypertensive drugs (nicardipine and telmisartan), and conivaptan treating hyponatremia show highest binding affinity to 3CLpro. Several natural compounds and derivatives with anti-virus and anti-inflammatory effects also exhibited high binding affinity to 3CLpro (Table   4 and Supporting excel file 3CLpro_NP.xlsx), including a series of andrographolide derivatives (chrysin-7-O-β-glucuronide from Scutellaria baicalensis, betulonal from Cassine xylocarpa, 2β-hydroxy-3,4-seco-friedelolactone-27-oic acid, isodecortinol and cerevisterol from Viola diffusa, hesperidin and neohesperidin from Citrus aurantium, kouitchenside I and deacetylcentapicrin from the plants of Swertia genus. The above results suggest that these small-molecule compounds might be the potential 3CLproinhibitors and could probably be used for treating SARS-CoV-2.It's worth mentioning, anti-asthmatic drug montelukast also showed low binding energy to 3CLpro. As shown in Fig. 5A , montelukast was well fitted into the active pocket of 3CLpro, in which lots of hydrophobic amino acids, just like Thr24, Leu27, His41, Phe140, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168 and His172 compose a relatively hydrophobic environment to contain the compound and stabilize its conformation. Hydrogen bonding was predicted between Asn142 and the carbonyl group of the compound (Fig. 5B ). DNA and RNA along the 5′-3′ direction in an NTP-dependent manner 37 . Importantly, it has been reported that the SARS-Nsp13 sequence is conserved and indispensable, and is a necessary component for the replication of coronavirus. Therefore, it has been identified as a target for anti-viral drug discovery, but there are few reports about Nsp13 inhibitors 38, 39 .Based on structure modeling of helicase protein, anti-bacterial drugs (lymecycline, cefsulodine and rolitetracycline), anti-fungal drug itraconazole, anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) drug saquinavir, anti-coagulant drug dabigatran, and diuretic drug canrenoic acid were predicted to be helicase inhibitors with high mfScores through virtual ligand screening. The natural products, such as many flavanoids from different sources (α-glucosyl hesperidin, hesperidin, rutin, quercetagetin 6-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and homovitexin), showed high binding affinity to this target.Besides the above targets, some non-structural proteins, including Nsp3b, Nsp3e, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp14, Nsp15, and Nsp16, also play an important role in the virus RNA synthesis and replication, suggesting these proteins may be useful targets for the anti-viral drug discovery. The virtual screening results showed many anti-bacterial, anti-viral, or anti-inflammatory drugs from ZINC drug database and our in-house natural products/derivatives database displayed potential good affinity to these targets, and the detailed information of virtual screening results is shown in Supporting excel files (for ZDD screening results, file names as target.xlsx; for natural products screening results, file names as target_NP.xlsx).Spike is the main structural protein of coronavirus and assembles into a special corolla structure on the surface of the virus as a trimer. Spike is a main protein that interacts with the host by binding to host cell receptors to mediate virus invasion and determine viral tissue or host tropism 40 . Spike is cleaved into S1 and S2 by the host cell protease like TMPRSS2, etc. The main function of S1 is to bind with host cell surface receptors, and the However, most of above compounds were not predicted to bind with the binding interface of the Spike-ACE2 complex. The only compound that could target the binding interface between Spike and ACE2 was hesperidin, as shown in Fig. 6A . Hesperidin was predicted to lie on the middle shallow pit of the surface of RBD of Spike, where the dihydroflavone part of the compound went parallel with the β-6 sheet of RBD.And the sugar part was inserted into the shallow pit in the direction away from ACE2, where a few hydrophobic amino acids, including Tyr436, Try440, Leu442, Phe443, Phe476, Try475, Try481 and Tyr49 form a relatively hydrophobic shallow pocket to contain the compound (Fig. 6B) . Hydrogen bonding was predicted between Tyr440 and the compound. By superimposing the ACE2-RBD complex to the hesperidin-RBD complex, a distinct overlap of hesperidin with the interface of ACE2 could be observed (Fig.   6C ), suggesting hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD.Except for Spike protein, E protein (E-channel) possesses important biological functions for the structural integrity of coronavirus and host virulence. NRBD and CRBD of coronavirus N protein are needed for N proteins in host cells to bind with coronavirus RNA efficiently. Therefore, E protein or N protein (NRBD and CRBD domains) can be used as targets for the discovery of anti-viral drugs. Through virtual screening, many anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-asthmatic, and anti-inflammatory drugs, etc. from ZINC database and our in-house natural products/derivatives database were found to display relatively good affinity to these targets. And the detailed results of virtual screening are given in Supplementary excel files.There are three coronavirus virulence factors Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a related to interfering host's innate immunity and assisting coronavirus immune escape. Nsp1 interacts with host 40S ribosomal subunit that induces specifically host mRNA degradation 42 and also inhibits type-I interferon production 43 . Nsp3c has ability to bind with host's ADP-ribose to help coronavirus resist host innate immunity 44 . Bone marrow matrix antigen 2 (BST-2) can inhibit the release of newly-assembled coronavirus from host cells. SARS-CoV ORF7a directly binds to BST-2 and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation of BST-2 45 . These evidences suggest that Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a may be potential targets for anti-viral drug discovery.The detailed screening results of Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a showed that a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited relatively high binding affinity to these three target proteins, such as piperacillin, cefpiramide, streptomycin, lymecycline, tetracycline, platycodin D from Platycodon grandifloras, wogonoside from Scutellaria baicalensis, vitexin from Vitex negundo, andrographolide derivatives, and xanthones from Swertia genus. The detailed results of virtual screening are shown in Supporting excel files.The host ACE2 has been proved by many studies to be the specific receptor for the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV 12 . The latest research shows that the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with SARS-CoV, exhibiting that the Spike RBD sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV RBD and there are important interactions between several key amino acid residues of RBD receptor-binding motif and ACE2 24 .Based on the current research progress, ACE2 is considered as a host target for the treatment of coronavirus infection to block SARS-CoV-2 from entering host cells.Based on the virtual screening results of ACE2 protein, anti-diabetes drug troglitazone, anti-hypertensive drug losartan, analgesia drug ergotamine, anti-bacterial drug cefmenoxime, and hepatoprotective drug silybin, etc., were predicted to bind with ACE2 with low energy. The natural products, such as phyllaemblicin G7from Phyllanthus emblica, xanthones from the plants of Swertiagenus, neohesperidin and hesperidin from Citrus aurantium, exhibited potentially high binding affinity to ACE2 protein. However, none of above ACE2binding compounds was predicted to target the ACE2-RBD interface.In addition, TMPRSS2 was known to cut the Spike to trigger the infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Studies have shown that inhibiting the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 can prevent some coronaviruses from entering host cells 46 . As a possible target for anti-viral drug discovery, the virtual screen results (shown in Supporting excel files) predicted many anti-bacterial drugs (pivampicillin, hetacillin, cefoperazone and clindamycin) and anti-virus natural compounds (phyllaemblicin G7, neoandrographolide, kouitchenside I), etc. to be potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.In order to further verify the screening results of ZINC drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately, we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation, including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.The RdRp inhibitor GPC-N114 49 .The binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the RNA template channel, which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide ( Fig. 7A and B) . The compound was well fitted with the shape of the pocket, where it formed three hydrogen bonds with Asn497, Arg569 and Asp684.In addition, hydrophobic interactions with Leu576, Ala685 and Tyr687 may further direct the favorite conformation of remdesivir (Fig. 7C) .Interestingly, remdesivir was predicted to bind with the target TMPRSS2 with low binding energy for both score and mfScore. As shown in Fig. 8A , remdesivir was bound in a relatively positively-charged allosteric pocket which is far away from the enzyme active center. Asn84 and Arg405 formed two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of the compound. Weak hydrophobic interaction between the pyrrolotriazine ring of remdesivir with Tyr131 and Try401, and side chains of some polar amino acids may further stabilize the compound conformation (Fig. 8B) . We also performed the longitudinal analysis on the drugs against 21 targets, and the results showed that only tenofovir, disoproxil, fumarate, and beclabuvir may bind to Nsp1. Fewer compounds were predicted to act on some targets, such as Nsp1, Nsp3e, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp16, NRBD, CRBD, ORF7a, and TMPRSS2,showing that these selected anti-viral drugs are unlikely to acting on the above targets of the new coronavirus, which provides a meaningful reference for our future research.For other targets, such as Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp,helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2, more anti-viral drugs were predicted to bind with them, especially E-channel, RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro, indicating that these targets are more likely to be useful for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic drugs from known anti-virals, and should be the focus of our subsequent research.The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current For those targets which are difficult to find direct inhibitors, or non-druggable targets, just like Nsp1, Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel, etc., currently popular PROTAC technology may be a good strategy to degrade these proteins and then inhibit the virus. The potential binding compounds found in this study for these targets might be a good start point.For Spike protein, we found only one compound, natural hesperidin was targeting the binding between Spike RBD and human ACE2. However, not like the ACE2 binding compounds, non-interface binding compound may still meaningful applications, considering that the fusion of CoVs membrane with host cell membrane need the big conformational change of remained Spike part after RBD removal 55 . Any small molecule bound to Spike at this time may interfere the re-folding of Spike therefore inhibits the viral infection process. Furthermore, small molecule that can target any part of Spike protein may be a good start point to design PROTAC based therapy.Also, we dock existing anti-viral drugs with our targets, analyze the possible targets of each anti-viral drug horizontally, and analyze the drugs that may interact with 21 targets vertically. We analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp, helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs. The three targets Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs. This may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein (Nsp3b and Nsp3c) or partial model (E-channel).Whether the screened anti-viral drugs really work on these targets needs further verification. We also do not recommend the application of new coronavirus pneumonia to compounds for which no target has been predicted.The triphosphate nucleotide product of remdesivir, remdesivir-TP, competes with RdRp for substrate ATP, so it can interfere with viral RNA synthesis. Our docking results show that remdesivir-TP binds to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with a score of -112.8, and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism, so we think remdesivir may be good in treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. In addition, remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human TMPRSS2, a protein facilitating the virus infection, this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research.Chloroquine phosphate has shown better anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in recent studies, but this drug has no clear target of action. In our docking results, chloroquine phosphate is predicted to possibly combine withNsp3b and E-channel. But we need to do further experiments to verify this conclusion.In Coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 10% 1, 2 (MERS-CoV) broke out in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35% 3, 4 . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, and their hosts are bat/civet and dromedary, respectively 5, 6 . To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Therefore, CoVs are considered to be a kind of viruses, of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans. Because Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019, the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or ""2019-nCoV"" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020 7, 8 . Since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous with SARS-CoV, it is considered a close relative of SARS-CoV. TheInternational Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified 2019-nCoV as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020. At the same time, WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV as COVID-19. Common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. There is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 9 .CoVs are enveloped viruses with a positive RNA genome, belonging to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales, which are divided into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β genus.CoVs contain at least four structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 10 . Among them, Spike promotes host attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion during virus infection. Therefore, Spike determines to some extent the host range.Potential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target, one is acting on the human immune system or human cells, and the other is on coronavirus itself. In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response 11 .Blocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect.In addition, viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells, for example, the SARS virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [12] [13] [14] and the MERS binds to the DPP4 receptor 15, 16 . The therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral RNA through acting on the genetic material of the virus, inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus, and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the virus's self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins.In the fight against coronavirus, scientists have come up with three strategies for developing new drugs 17 .The first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals 18 . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too ""broad-spectrum"" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.Theoretically, the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects, but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years, or even more than 10 years 11 .For the development of medicines treating SARS-CoV-2, the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs. Once the efficacy is determined, it can be approved by the Green Channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients. Herein, bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted, and the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc. Further, we used these proteins and human relative proteins [human ACE2 and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) enzymes] as targets to screen ZINC U. S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug database (ZINC drug database, ZDD), our own database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine), and the database of commonly used anti-viral drugs (78 compounds) by virtual ligand screening method. This study predicts a variety of compounds that may inhibit novel coronaviruses and provides scientists with information on compounds that may be effective. Subsequent validation of anti-viral effects in vitro and in vivo will provide useful information for clinical treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.The complete genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) was downloaded from NCBI nucleotide database. The nucleotide sequences were aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes (Alogorithm parameters, max target sequences: 1000, expect threshold: 10). We obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Gene Bank. The genome sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 was aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes. After phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species. We found three coronaviruses from bat (96%, 88% and 88% for Bat-Cov RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC12 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively) have the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, as shown in Fig is helicase. As a new coronavirus, structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage. Until now, only one crystal structure of 3CLpro has been deposited in PDB (pdb code: 6LU7).In order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening, we aligned all protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 with all sequences in PDB1018 database in Fold & Function Assignment System (Supporting Information Figs. S19-S34). Fortunately, most of these proteins have found their high homology proteins that have three-dimensional structure, with homology between 72%-99% (Supporting Information Table S1 ). Those PDB codes were labeled below the corresponding sequences in Fig. 2B . Unsurprisingly, all these proteins with the highest homology are from SARS. Nevertheless, there are some proteins still have not high homologous in the database. After the prediction of transmembrane helices in these proteins carried out in TMHMM Server, as expected, we found that all these proteins are transmembrane proteins except for Nsp2 (Supporting Information Figs. S35-S41). So far, we have found as much structural information of this viral proteins as possible, which provides the basis for subsequent homology modeling and drug screening. Before homology modeling, all these proteins sequences were aligned with model sequences derived from SARS-CoV and predicted secondary structure as the same time ( Fig. 3A and Table S1 ). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3A , important anti-virus drug target protein like 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp are highly conserved between those two human coronaviruses, especially in functional region. As shown in Table S1 , all these potential drug target proteins have been homologously modeled, and all generated protein models were provided as the PDB files in Supporting Information. All other coordinates of target-screening hit complexes can be provided upon request.In order to verify the accuracy of homologous modeling, we aligned the computational structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that modeled from the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with its crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (6LU7) just solved and released during this manuscript was being prepared. sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is 76% (Fig. 3C ). Recent researches speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could also bind to ACE2, and this was verified by computational docking and ELISA measurement 24, 25 . Moreover, homology of the Spike-RBD sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoVRaTG13 is as high as 95%. Despite the high homology of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 in Spike sequence, our analysis found that four among the five most important amino acids (L465, L495, Y502, D510, and H514) that bind to ACE2 12 in Bat-CoV RaTG13 differ from SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 3C ). And there is no related research literature about whether Bat-CoV RaTG13 can infect human yet. We also performed homology modeling on the Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike RBD (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ). Three Spike RBD structures have been docked with human ACE2. Among them, for the conformations which most resemble the crystal structure of SARS RBD-ACE2 complex 26 , the binding free energy between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and human ACE2 was -33.72 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S2 ), that between SARS-CoV Spike RBD and ACE2 was -49.22 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S3 ), and that between Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike RBD and ACE2 was -31.06 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S4 ).The therapies that act on the coronavirus can be divided into several categories based on the specific pathways:(1) some acting on enzymes or functional proteins that are critical to virus, preventing the virus RNA synthesis and replication; (2) some acting on structural proteins of virus, blocking virus from binding to human cell receptors, or inhibiting the virus's self-assembly process; (3) some producing virulence factor to restore host's innate immunity; (4) some acting on host's specific receptors or enzymes, preventing virus from entering into host's cells. The related target proteins include Nsp1, Nsp3 (Nsp3b, Nsp3c, PLpro, and Nsp3e), Based on homology models of the above 18 viral proteins (19 models) and 2 human targets, we resorted to structure-based virtual ligand screening method using ICM 3.7.3 modeling software (MolSoft LLC) to screen potential small-molecule compounds from a ZINC Drug Database (2924 compounds) and a small in-house database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine) and derivatives (1066 compounds). Compounds with lower calculated binding energies (being expressed with scores and mfScores) are considered to have higher binding affinities with the target protein.As PLpro is responsible for the cleavages of N-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3, which is essential for correcting virus replication 27 .PLpro was also confirmed to be significant to antagonize the host's innate immunity [28] [29] [30] . As an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host, PLpro has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors. It is very valuable for targeting PLpro to treat coronavirus infections, but no inhibitor has been approved by the FDA for marketing.The screening results (Table 1 and Anti-viral drug ribavirin was predicted to bind to PLpro with low binding energy (Scores=-38.58). From generated docking model, ribavirin was bound in the active site of the enzyme as reported SARS-PLpro inhibitors (PDB code 3e9s). Hydrogen bonds were predicted between Gly164, Gln270, Tyr274, Asp303 and the compound. Also, π-π stacking was found between Tyr265 and triazolering in the compound ( Fig. 4A and B). The strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between ribavirin with the enzyme imply it may be a potent PLpro inhibitor.The 3CLpro, also known as Nsp5, is first automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then further cleaves downstream Nsps at 11 sites to release Nsp4-Nsp16 31 . 3CLpro directly mediates the maturation of Nsps, which is essential in the life cycle of the virus. The detailed investigation on the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro makes 3CLpro an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug development. Inhibitors targeting at SARS-CoV 3CLpro mainly include peptide inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors [32] .3CLpro monomer has three domains, domain I (residues 8-101), domain II (residues 102-184) anddomain III (residues 201-303), and a long loop (residues 185-200) connects domains II and III. The active site of 3CLpro is located in the gap between domains I and II, and has a CysHis catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) 33 . As shown in Table 3 and Supporting excel file 3CLpro.xlsx), anti-bacterial drugs (lymecycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline and oxytetracycline), anti-hypertensive drugs (nicardipine and telmisartan), and conivaptan treating hyponatremia show highest binding affinity to 3CLpro. Several natural compounds and derivatives with anti-virus and anti-inflammatory effects also exhibited high binding affinity to 3CLpro (Table   4 and Supporting excel file 3CLpro_NP.xlsx), including a series of andrographolide derivatives (chrysin-7-O-β-glucuronide from Scutellaria baicalensis, betulonal from Cassine xylocarpa, 2β-hydroxy-3,4-seco-friedelolactone-27-oic acid, isodecortinol and cerevisterol from Viola diffusa, hesperidin and neohesperidin from Citrus aurantium, kouitchenside I and deacetylcentapicrin from the plants of Swertia genus. The above results suggest that these small-molecule compounds might be the potential 3CLproinhibitors and could probably be used for treating SARS-CoV-2.It's worth mentioning, anti-asthmatic drug montelukast also showed low binding energy to 3CLpro. As shown in Fig. 5A , montelukast was well fitted into the active pocket of 3CLpro, in which lots of hydrophobic amino acids, just like Thr24, Leu27, His41, Phe140, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168 and His172 compose a relatively hydrophobic environment to contain the compound and stabilize its conformation. Hydrogen bonding was predicted between Asn142 and the carbonyl group of the compound (Fig. 5B ). DNA and RNA along the 5′-3′ direction in an NTP-dependent manner 37 . Importantly, it has been reported that the SARS-Nsp13 sequence is conserved and indispensable, and is a necessary component for the replication of coronavirus. Therefore, it has been identified as a target for anti-viral drug discovery, but there are few reports about Nsp13 inhibitors 38, 39 .Based on structure modeling of helicase protein, anti-bacterial drugs (lymecycline, cefsulodine and rolitetracycline), anti-fungal drug itraconazole, anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) drug saquinavir, anti-coagulant drug dabigatran, and diuretic drug canrenoic acid were predicted to be helicase inhibitors with high mfScores through virtual ligand screening. The natural products, such as many flavanoids from different sources (α-glucosyl hesperidin, hesperidin, rutin, quercetagetin 6-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and homovitexin), showed high binding affinity to this target.Besides the above targets, some non-structural proteins, including Nsp3b, Nsp3e, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp14, Nsp15, and Nsp16, also play an important role in the virus RNA synthesis and replication, suggesting these proteins may be useful targets for the anti-viral drug discovery. The virtual screening results showed many anti-bacterial, anti-viral, or anti-inflammatory drugs from ZINC drug database and our in-house natural products/derivatives database displayed potential good affinity to these targets, and the detailed information of virtual screening results is shown in Supporting excel files (for ZDD screening results, file names as target.xlsx; for natural products screening results, file names as target_NP.xlsx).Spike is the main structural protein of coronavirus and assembles into a special corolla structure on the surface of the virus as a trimer. Spike is a main protein that interacts with the host by binding to host cell receptors to mediate virus invasion and determine viral tissue or host tropism 40 . Spike is cleaved into S1 and S2 by the host cell protease like TMPRSS2, etc. The main function of S1 is to bind with host cell surface receptors, and the However, most of above compounds were not predicted to bind with the binding interface of the Spike-ACE2 complex. The only compound that could target the binding interface between Spike and ACE2 was hesperidin, as shown in Fig. 6A . Hesperidin was predicted to lie on the middle shallow pit of the surface of RBD of Spike, where the dihydroflavone part of the compound went parallel with the β-6 sheet of RBD.And the sugar part was inserted into the shallow pit in the direction away from ACE2, where a few hydrophobic amino acids, including Tyr436, Try440, Leu442, Phe443, Phe476, Try475, Try481 and Tyr49 form a relatively hydrophobic shallow pocket to contain the compound (Fig. 6B) . Hydrogen bonding was predicted between Tyr440 and the compound. By superimposing the ACE2-RBD complex to the hesperidin-RBD complex, a distinct overlap of hesperidin with the interface of ACE2 could be observed (Fig.   6C ), suggesting hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD.Except for Spike protein, E protein (E-channel) possesses important biological functions for the structural integrity of coronavirus and host virulence. NRBD and CRBD of coronavirus N protein are needed for N proteins in host cells to bind with coronavirus RNA efficiently. Therefore, E protein or N protein (NRBD and CRBD domains) can be used as targets for the discovery of anti-viral drugs. Through virtual screening, many anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-asthmatic, and anti-inflammatory drugs, etc. from ZINC database and our in-house natural products/derivatives database were found to display relatively good affinity to these targets. And the detailed results of virtual screening are given in Supplementary excel files.There are three coronavirus virulence factors Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a related to interfering host's innate immunity and assisting coronavirus immune escape. Nsp1 interacts with host 40S ribosomal subunit that induces specifically host mRNA degradation 42 and also inhibits type-I interferon production 43 . Nsp3c has ability to bind with host's ADP-ribose to help coronavirus resist host innate immunity 44 . Bone marrow matrix antigen 2 (BST-2) can inhibit the release of newly-assembled coronavirus from host cells. SARS-CoV ORF7a directly binds to BST-2 and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation of BST-2 45 . These evidences suggest that Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a may be potential targets for anti-viral drug discovery.The detailed screening results of Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a showed that a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited relatively high binding affinity to these three target proteins, such as piperacillin, cefpiramide, streptomycin, lymecycline, tetracycline, platycodin D from Platycodon grandifloras, wogonoside from Scutellaria baicalensis, vitexin from Vitex negundo, andrographolide derivatives, and xanthones from Swertia genus. The detailed results of virtual screening are shown in Supporting excel files.The host ACE2 has been proved by many studies to be the specific receptor for the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV 12 . The latest research shows that the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with SARS-CoV, exhibiting that the Spike RBD sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV RBD and there are important interactions between several key amino acid residues of RBD receptor-binding motif and ACE2 24 .Based on the current research progress, ACE2 is considered as a host target for the treatment of coronavirus infection to block SARS-CoV-2 from entering host cells.Based on the virtual screening results of ACE2 protein, anti-diabetes drug troglitazone, anti-hypertensive drug losartan, analgesia drug ergotamine, anti-bacterial drug cefmenoxime, and hepatoprotective drug silybin, etc., were predicted to bind with ACE2 with low energy. The natural products, such as phyllaemblicin G7from Phyllanthus emblica, xanthones from the plants of Swertiagenus, neohesperidin and hesperidin from Citrus aurantium, exhibited potentially high binding affinity to ACE2 protein. However, none of above ACE2binding compounds was predicted to target the ACE2-RBD interface.In addition, TMPRSS2 was known to cut the Spike to trigger the infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Studies have shown that inhibiting the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 can prevent some coronaviruses from entering host cells 46 . As a possible target for anti-viral drug discovery, the virtual screen results (shown in Supporting excel files) predicted many anti-bacterial drugs (pivampicillin, hetacillin, cefoperazone and clindamycin) and anti-virus natural compounds (phyllaemblicin G7, neoandrographolide, kouitchenside I), etc. to be potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.In order to further verify the screening results of ZINC drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately, we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation, including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.The RdRp inhibitor GPC-N114 49 .The binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the RNA template channel, which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide ( Fig. 7A and B) . The compound was well fitted with the shape of the pocket, where it formed three hydrogen bonds with Asn497, Arg569 and Asp684.In addition, hydrophobic interactions with Leu576, Ala685 and Tyr687 may further direct the favorite conformation of remdesivir (Fig. 7C) .Interestingly, remdesivir was predicted to bind with the target TMPRSS2 with low binding energy for both score and mfScore. As shown in Fig. 8A , remdesivir was bound in a relatively positively-charged allosteric pocket which is far away from the enzyme active center. Asn84 and Arg405 formed two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of the compound. Weak hydrophobic interaction between the pyrrolotriazine ring of remdesivir with Tyr131 and Try401, and side chains of some polar amino acids may further stabilize the compound conformation (Fig. 8B) . We also performed the longitudinal analysis on the drugs against 21 targets, and the results showed that only tenofovir, disoproxil, fumarate, and beclabuvir may bind to Nsp1. Fewer compounds were predicted to act on some targets, such as Nsp1, Nsp3e, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp16, NRBD, CRBD, ORF7a, and TMPRSS2,showing that these selected anti-viral drugs are unlikely to acting on the above targets of the new coronavirus, which provides a meaningful reference for our future research.For other targets, such as Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp,helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2, more anti-viral drugs were predicted to bind with them, especially E-channel, RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro, indicating that these targets are more likely to be useful for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic drugs from known anti-virals, and should be the focus of our subsequent research.The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current For those targets which are difficult to find direct inhibitors, or non-druggable targets, just like Nsp1, Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel, etc., currently popular PROTAC technology may be a good strategy to degrade these proteins and then inhibit the virus. The potential binding compounds found in this study for these targets might be a good start point.For Spike protein, we found only one compound, natural hesperidin was targeting the binding between Spike RBD and human ACE2. However, not like the ACE2 binding compounds, non-interface binding compound may still meaningful applications, considering that the fusion of CoVs membrane with host cell membrane need the big conformational change of remained Spike part after RBD removal 55 . Any small molecule bound to Spike at this time may interfere the re-folding of Spike therefore inhibits the viral infection process. Furthermore, small molecule that can target any part of Spike protein may be a good start point to design PROTAC based therapy.Also, we dock existing anti-viral drugs with our targets, analyze the possible targets of each anti-viral drug horizontally, and analyze the drugs that may interact with 21 targets vertically. We analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp, helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs. The three targets Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs. This may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein (Nsp3b and Nsp3c) or partial model (E-channel).Whether the screened anti-viral drugs really work on these targets needs further verification. We also do not recommend the application of new coronavirus pneumonia to compounds for which no target has been predicted.The triphosphate nucleotide product of remdesivir, remdesivir-TP, competes with RdRp for substrate ATP, so it can interfere with viral RNA synthesis. Our docking results show that remdesivir-TP binds to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with a score of -112.8, and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism, so we think remdesivir may be good in treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. In addition, remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human TMPRSS2, a protein facilitating the virus infection, this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research.Chloroquine phosphate has shown better anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in recent studies, but this drug has no clear target of action. In our docking results, chloroquine phosphate is predicted to possibly combine withNsp3b and E-channel. But we need to do further experiments to verify this conclusion.In "
13jupb26,"Computers and viral diseases. Preliminary bioinformatics studies on the design of a synthetic vaccine and a preventative peptidomimetic antagonist against the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) coronavirus","Coronaviruses are viruses of both medical and veterinary importance [1] . They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) responsible for the epidemic in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In the past ten years, many new coronaviruses have been identified. They infect a wide range of hosts from mammals to birds and closely related coronaviruses have been identified in distantly related animals suggesting recent interspecies jumps [1] . Like influenza viruses that have similar epidemic properties, they are single stranded RNA viruses with a lipoprotein envelope, and enter the host cells by a Class I fusion protein, i.e. one that does not require any other viral surface proteins for fusion. Viral fusion proteins are potential therapeutic and vaccine targets, and the above is indicative of the possibility that the kind of considerations discussed in the present paper can be extended to broader range of viruses.The present series of studies (e.g. Ref. [2] ) concerns studies on the genome of the Wuhan seafood market isolate [3] believed responsible for the current pandemic. It is believed that this is the same virus as that also called SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 virus after the disease now designated COVID-19. The nomenclature is apparently still not fully settled and the preceding choice of name 2019-nCoV remains popular, so it is used throughout below. See Section 1.3 for a brief account concerning the evolving name of this virus and concerns over strains of it. As far as matters relating to findings regarding the genomics of 2019-nCoV and the design of synthetic vaccines, diagnostics and peptidomimetic drugs are concerned, ref [2] may be regarded as an early preprint to the present paper. There is discussion here regarding particular World Wide Web access methodologies used to facilitate the study (See Section 2 below), but the virus remains the priority and further and new work on the virus itself is included. However, although not absolutely essential, using a ""robot"" autobrowser to surf the internet to capture knowledge and keep up with developments proved very valuable in this case. That is because the situation concerning important scientific data about 2019-nCoV is changing rapidly, as one may expect in an epidemic (now technically a pandemic at least by traditional criteria) of such concern, but seemingly more than in previous epidemics at such an early stage.Some keys examples of rapid progress, and the timeline of some particularly relevant events in the last phase of this study, are as follows. The above paper [2] was posted on 30 th January 2020. The first version of the present paper was submitted to the journal on 2 nd February 2020. After the completion of the study and the first version of the present paper, a bat virus with 97.41% identity of the spike protein) that is of particular interest in the present paper (as described in Section 1.4 below). This recent bat coronavirus sequence was entered into Genbank as entry QHR63300.1. In addition, two days before the time of writing the present paper, on the 5 th February 2020, entry 6LU7 (DOI: 10 .2210/pdb6LU7/pdb) appeared in the protein data bank (PDB), being the three dimensional structure of the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV main protease that is encoded within the viral genome, in complex with an inhibitor. As may be expected, papers considering modeling of various viral proteins and interaction are appearing almost by the minute. Using the automated surfing methods described in the present paper, examples appearing include a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announcement about researchers developing a preliminary set of predictive 3D protein structures of 2019-nCoV to aid research efforts to combat the disease, as discussed in Section 4.1.1. The above protease is a potential target, but not the subject of interest in the present study.Because at the time of this study and the preparation of this paper it was unclear, and perhaps even discouraged, that the virus of interest should be considered as a strain of SARS (see Section 1.3), much below, and of ref [2] as an early preprint of it, follows the notion of using bat and particularly human SARS as a reference model. This is after ref [2] identified these viruses as closely related to 2019-nCoV. The important assumption is that the molecular mechanism of infection is very similar. With 2019-nCoV now seen as a type or strain of SARS, this assumption seems not only justified but also rather trivial. However, it will still be emphasized to some extent because it is, of course, only the classification nomenclature that has changed, not the molecular relationships between sequences and structures described. Moreover, as discussed in this paper, it is not just 2019-nCoV itself or viruses very similar to it that help design means of combatting the virus, but actually those with more weakly matching genomes that are most informative in these kind of studies, which might be described as ""comparative bioinformatics"". Indeed, it is conserved surface regions that are of particular interest, and hence, should it emerge that the viral strain or nomenclature being considered is incorrect, the conclusions of a paper like this one would likely remain essentially the same, providing there is still sequence similarity for the surface protein of interest. 2019-nCoV continues to be of great concern due to its high rate of infectivity and protracted time to show symptoms. For that reason analysis is done in a way that relates to the design of diagnostic, vaccines, and therapeutic agents. These are peptides, i.e. molecules composed of a few (say, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] amino acid resides, that relate to actual parts of the amino acid sequence of a whole viral protein: see Section 1.5. These sections are continuous sections; the significance, limitations, and remedies for this are discussed in Discussion and Conclusions Section 5. Potential candidate segments of sequence converge in Results Section 4 to one particularly favored section of sequence of 13 amino acid residues, and modifications of it as ""peptide designs"". Some observations regarding work identified as relating to smaller rigid compounds as potential drugs are also discussed, along with some preliminary conformational and docking studies.Despite the above comments, it remains that in the early stages of a pandemic, one needs to ensure that one is addressing the virus described, and indeed be cautious as to what the phrase ""the same virus"" might mean in practice. In that regard, as well as a matter of literature searching, it has helped neither researchers nor news organizations (and meeting and conference organizers) that the name for the virus and disease has constantly changed over the past few weeks, and indeed days. The WHO decided to prefer the name ""2019-nCoV"" hours before release of the previous report by the present author in January 2020 [2] , although the final decision on the virus' official name still awaited the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. At the time of final writing of this text, the WHO named the disease COVID-19, so one can reasonably speak of the ""COVID-10"" or ""Covid-19 virus"". The above previous report by the author [2] was early in pointing out that the (Wuhan seafood market isolate) virus surface protein of particular interest below is closely related to that of human and bat SARS, and at the time of rewriting the present paper, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses decided that 2019-nCoV was a variant of the coronavirus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-03. However the new name SARS-CoV-2 is not universally popular, and the nomenclature 2019-nCoV virus or just 2019-nCoV is used throughout this text. Chinese researchers and government have worked industriously to publish their determination of the early detected Wuhan virus on several web sites. At the time of writing, there were some concerns expressed, often outside the mainstream peer reviewed scientific literature, that what is seen as the current 2019-nCoV pandemic is not due to the same virus as that specified as ""Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate"" (e.g. Ref. [3] ), i.e. GenBank entry MN908947, which is used here. On January 17th , 2019, MN908947.3 replaced MN908947.2, and probably represents an adequate stable description of the sequence for research into that strain isolate [3] . The entry describes an RNA virus with an RNA sequence of 29033 bases. Despite the above concerns, it is believed that MN908947.3, available at the time of the present study, is essentially the Wuhan seafood market isolate and 2019-nCoV except for any genome changes due to accepted mutations, as is typically the case in the course of a viral epidemic. RNA viruses usually held to have much higher mutation rates than DNA viruses.The above considerations impact a central theme of this paper. It is parts of the surface of a virus that normally interacts with the host cells for entry and which are vulnerable to the host immune system. Unfortunately, it is also exposed regions on surface proteins that accept mutations more readily, except at important interaction sites. If compounds designed as weapons against the virus are based on sections of amino acid sequence that can readily change, then they will quickly become useless (""escape by mutation""). The strain is thus again important but, as noted above, it is no less the variations between virus genomes, taking into account the relationships of the genome of interest with those of both closely related and distantly related viruses that are particularly informative for the present kind of study. This is also important because direct information about the structure, function and action of the proteins encoded by the genome is not, at time of writing, available for 2019-nCoV, and one seeks to make reasonable extrapolations from what is known for other related viruses.More specifically focus is on the Class I fusion protein of the coronaviruses which is a glycoprotein known as the spike protein (S) that protrudes extensively from the virus envelope surface. It is responsible for binding to the receptor on the host cell as well as mediating the fusion of host and viral membranes [4] . S, most frequently referred to as the ""spike protein"" or ""spike glycoprotein"" below, is synthesized as a single-chain precursor of approximately 1300 amino acids and forms a trimer of 3 S proteins on folding. The trimeric SARS coronavirus (SAR-S-CoV) spike glycoprotein consists of three S1-S2 heterodimers and binds the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes through a pre-to postfusion conformation transition. Airway protease cleavage site along the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein have been identified [5] . Reading from the N-terminus of S1, the important functional elements of the spike including protease cleavage sites as described from SARS studies [5, 6] are the S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD), the S1 C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), the S1/S2 as the first protease cleavage site as a loop between a pleated sheet and a-helix, the fusion peptide (FP) associated with a highly disordered loop between two a-helices which contains the second cleavage site S2', and a heptad repeat (HR). Fig. 1 shows the approximate positions of the cleavage points in the SARS S1 spike protein within the trimer, superimposed on the Protein data bank entry 5XLR. The heptad repeat has so far attracted most interest as the research lead for a therapeutic, preventative agent. Membrane fusion and cell entry is mediated through extensive post-receptor-binding structural rearrangements in which two heptad repeat (HR) regions play a key role: HR1, positioned C-terminal of a hydrophobic fusion peptide, and HR2 or, located N-terminal of the transmembrane domain. Central to the fusion process is the formation of the stable six-helix bundle in which HR2 regions assemble into the grooves formed by the trimeric HR1 coiled coil.Some care is needed in deducing mechanisms of activation and cell entry, and hence potential therapies, on the basis of using different types of virus as reference models. This is because there are four main types of coronavirus with differences in spike proteins and it is known that here are some differences in activation and lung cell entry. Renaming the believed causative agent of COVID-19 to indicate it as a type of SARS does not alleviate the concern that different strains use different mechanisms: very few point mutations might change the modes of cell entry. The entry types with represented examples are as follows [4] . Genus Alphacoronavirus: human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Genus Betacoronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), bat coronavirus HKU4, mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and human coronavirus OC43. Genus Gammacoronavirus avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Genus Deltacoronavirus: porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCV). The bioinformatics-based approach can also be reproduced by standard tools, but is facilitated by Q-UEL tools, especially with the explosive growth in studies regarding 2019-nCoV.The alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV recognize a zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for target cell binding but alphacoronaviruses such as TGEV, PEDV, and PRCV recognize a zinc peptidase called aminopeptidase N (APN). Also for example, SARS-CoV and betacoronaviruses can recognize different receptors: MERS-CoV and HKU4 recognize a serine peptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). It is known from studies on the SARS coronavirus that activation by a trypsin-like protease naturally present in the lung appears essential to activate the virus for cell binding and entry by cleaving S at two sites [5, 6] . The three dimensional structure of the original human SARS spike protein is known by high resolution electron microscopy [7] , though again very few point mutations might change the entry mechanism.If an Achilles' heel of a coronavirus resides in certain parts of the spike protein as discussed above, the natural choices of preliminary weapons are synthetic peptides (e.g. Refs. [8] [9] [10] ). This choice reflects a history for synthetic (or otherwise biotechnologically produced) peptides that has developed rapidly since the 1980s, seen as the basis of therapeutics [11, 12] and vaccines [11, 13] . Related work by other researchers are exemplified by Refs. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , and other efforts are cited at appropriate points below, and in regard to pathogens more generally in Section 5.6. Like many of those efforts, the author and colleagues also had significant success in the past in designing synthetic peptides that at least in some useful way helped combat disease and epidemics. These included some 50 reported studies including HIV that proved diagnostic value in the laboratory (e.g. Refs. [14] [15] [16] ), and BSE (Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Mad Cow Disease) [17, 18] which led to the early useful diagnostic marketed worldwide by Abbott Laboratories [19] . Other example studies have included immunotherapeutic strategies, and putative vaccines against bacterial pathogens, Ebola and flaviviruses: see Ref. [20] for discussion and a general introductory review of this kind of approach.These projects resulted in a body of experience and design rules-ofthumb which the author and collaborators are seeking to capture by the methods described in Section 4. It is to be understood that peptides proposed as B-epitopes for the construction of synthetic peptides rarely work well alone (recall that immunogenicity is the ability of a particular substance to provoke an immune response in the body, and that an epitope or antigenic determinant is the small part of an antigen that is recognized and distinguished by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells). Ensuring choice of segment of sequence for synthesis and presence of amino acids with at least some reasonable level of immunogenicity is just a small (but important) first step of the vaccine construct. 1 None of such studies by the present author and collaborators have previously addressed a coronavirus in any significant way, but several laboratories skilled in coronavirus science have used peptides based on the heptad repeat HR; they have been considered as antiviral drugs to prohibit virus cell entry, and there has been significant success in the laboratory for some coronaviruses and host species (e.g. Refs. [7, 8] ). However, to the author's knowledge that has not been a significant success toward a medical product based on the HR. One reason may be that coronaviruses escape from HR2-derived Peptide Entry Inhibition by mutations. This is particularly indicated in the HR1 domain of the spike fusion protein, suggesting that only limited options exist for escape from the inhibitory effect of the HR2 peptide [9, 10] . An alternative is the two cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2 0 required for activation for cell entry. Since these sites are exposed to the solvent [7] they are plausible targets for several preventative, therapeutic, and diagnostic purposes. The sites may also represent epitopes serving as either the basis for design of a synthetic peptide vaccine, when linked to a carrier protein or a deigned cloned protein. Even if they fail to implant immune memory, they may also form the basis for production antibodies as ""sera"" for passive immunity and for usein diagnostic kits and biosensors. Importantly there is also the possibility that, as in the case of peptide analogues of the heptad repeats, they might serve as the basis for design for inhibitors of cell entry, not by binding to the coronavirus, but to the trypsin-like proteases of the lung in a preventative manner, prior to virus exposure.Very early in the above peptide studies by the author and colleagues it was discovered that the bioinformatics and peptide and protein modelling steps required in each investigation were capable of a high degree of automation [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The PROMETHEUS expert system based on the GLOBAL polymorphic programing language also developed by the author and colleagues [26, 27] played a major role in many of the later peptide studies including the BSE diagnostic. Some of the general ideas from a user perspective are used in the present studies, but they employed the more recent Q-UEL language [28] . This language is significantly different from GLOBAL and other languages, being a radical extension of XML to probabilistic semantics with the tags having algebraic force [28] , but it had already been seen to provide a useful platform for studies of epidemics and design of peptides [20] .The theory behind Q-UEL has been described and developed in several essentially mathematical papers. Refs [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] provide a more relevant and applied mathematical account, in conjunction with algorithm and software development. Ref [28] provided the first detailed description of the Q-UEL language as a means of interacting with the World Wide Web and potentially proving the basis of a ""Thinking Web"" for medicine, primarily by rendering the emerging Semantic Web as more fundamentally probabilistic [28] . The underlying theory of probabilistic semantics is somewhat irrelevant in the present case because there is no great need to consider probabilities associated with elements of knowledge about the bioinformatics of coronaviruses that Q-UEL's XML-like tags express. Note, however, that probabilities do become more relevant in clinical genomics involving patient DNA sequences [36] , and a similar case can be made that homologies as extents of match between viral protein sequences, and uses of automated probabilistic reasoning, will be useful in the future.Q-UEL is in part concerned with automation of computer and Internet-centric research tasks. Mainly, in the present study this involved automatic surfing of the World Wide Web to speed access to information about coronaviruses, and to capture that in canonical form, i.e. as Q-UE's XML-like ""tags"" as statements of knowledge. A major 1 In brief summary of the previous work above and current conventional thinking, the peptides seen as epitopes are generally envisaged as needing to be attached to immunogenic proteins safe to the patent or receiving test organism, but not so familiar to the receiving immune systems as to cause significant cross reactions (e.g. inducing autoimmune disease). Also while B epitopes from exposed regions of a pathogen are key to the antibody response, T epitopes from anywhere in the pathogen proteins may be needed for T-system memory and cellular responses, and the overall structure may benefit from linkage to molecular adjuvants such as muramyl dipeptide, and possibly to other stimulating and anti-suppressor peptides. In short, the peptide of initial interest may only be a small part of what would look like a complex molecular 'Swiss Army knife"". Nonetheless, these additions are to varying extents already understood support technologies (even if not as yet favored for human usesee discussion later below). The various components can be seen as interchangeable and/or ""reusable"" parts, the essence of a ""cartridge"" approach to synthetic vaccines intended to facilitate a quicker response to new infectious diseases. Among them the B-epitope from some part of the virus surface remains key to immune system recognition. difference from previous genomics use cases for Q-UEL [36] is that the notion of types of coronavirus and strain replaced the notion of human patient. The specific software of the decision support system interacting with the Internet was the more recent BioIngine implementation of Q-UEL and associated software applications [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . These applications generate and use Q-UEL tags to extract, communicate knowledge and draw conclusions from it by automated inference. The interaction with source text and bioinformatics tools on the World Wide Web is in keeping with the originally intended spirit of facilitating a ""Thinking Web"" for the Internet [28] . However, the Q-UEL tags here served more in the role of an architectural principle. See Fig. 2 . Most of the ""Bioinformatics Based Approach"" on the right hand side of Fig. 2 could be carried out in the usual way of interacting manually with the web sites, and sometimes were. Q-UEL there has the role of facilitating but not of being essential for the study, except in the sense that this paper may, arguably, may have been written very differently and much later in the face of explosive development of worldwide research into 2109-nCoV.One of several motivations [36] for developing an integrated genomics and bioinformatics approach based on Q-UEL was that the popular highly integrated Biology Workbench at the San Diego Supercomputer Center is no longer available at the time of writing [37]. However, some standard web tools used prominently in present work on the coronavirus spike sequence are already in a suite that at least integrates aspects concerned with a particular tool, and the web pages are sufficiently easy to use in the normal manual way. Nonetheless, an automated approach is valuable for speedier research, and for capturing knowledge from the Internet in Q-UEL tags. As well as capturing expertise of the human user regarding the workflow, it leads to full reproducibility. For the most part, output from BLASTP as used at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Bla st.cgi [38] is still expressed below in that form familiar to bioinformatics researchers, rather than as it appeared in Q-UEL tags. Also see Ref. [36] for the formats for Q-UEL representation of bioinformatics information of this kind.Previously, a number of ways of gathering information from the Internet into Q-UEL tag form have been explored. For example, a Q-UEL-CTRACT tag in Ref. [28] was generated by interacting with the HTML on the webpage for Google queries and the resulting list of hits. In the present paper, extensive use was made of MARPLE/HDNstudent with XTRACTOR [30, 31] . This provides convenient ways of making search queries for initiating ""autosurfing"" of the Internet. In the present case, there were some 170,108 Q-UEL tags already representing statements of medical knowledge in the KRS (albeit several tags have been found that essentially duplicate the same knowledge). However, these are not as yet exhaustive of medical knowledge and focused on a number of specialized medical areas. While many related to viral infections, there was no detail at the time of the study regarding 2019-nCoV structure. Hence the gathering of new knowledge from the Internet was important. In the course of the recent phase of study, a site particularly frequently ""hit"" was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel_coronavirus_(2019-nCoV). Its content changed significantly since first appearance. It remains that a good secondary ""scientific news"" source concerning the course of the epidemic is that Wikipedia entry because it appears to regularly updated. Table 1 shows the one letter amino acid code used for peptide and protein primary structure throughout the study and in the following text, and also shows a consensus over conservative substitutions in the course of evolution (as accepted mutations), with common secondary structure propensities, and as alternatives in peptide design, i.e. amino acid residues with similar properties [11] . With a focus on design, the relationships are not intended to be symmetric, e.g. starting from E gives one more option than going from D to E, and actual choices in simulation studies can change depending on details of interactions.XTRACTOR was accessed in several ways, and one generated tags such as the following which describes how Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers ""have developed a preliminary set of predictive 3D protein structures of the virus to aid research efforts to combat the disease"". This and the following example are new tag specifications developed for the present project.Note that the query is ""protein structure prediction coronavirus"" but the words are also legally ""nominal categorical"" data types and legal attributes in the above tag construction. Another example with a status report was as follows.One letter amino acid codes used in the text.Amino acid Conservative replacementsIn contrast, XTRACTOR as it is used by MARPLE [36] has the big advantage of capturing, parsing, and standardizing content. In the present case, it was essentially repurposed. A number of examination-like questions were set, with the ""question ""replaced by a brief project description and ""answers"" replaced by queries, e.g. Case 1. Investigation into the Wuhan seafood market coronavirus, bioinformatics analysis of the spike protein. Answers. (A) Wuhan coronavirus, (B) SARS, (C) Coronaviruses, (D) Spike protein, (E) Lung diseases. The final weighting of the candidate ""answers"" was similar in this case at 24% for (A) and 19% for the rest and simply suggests that the process of reasoning found each query highly relevant to the ""question"" part. In its process of scoring the World Wide Web for answers to the queries, text is captured, parsed and reorganized into XTRACT tags that for future use in automated inference are readily decomposed into semantic triples and linear semantic multiples [36] . However, in the present project they are primarily of value for collecting knowledge for review by the researcher, as part of an automated systematic review process [33] , and to time stamp the tags along with provenance information. This is very useful here because research and even these sites, are changing. Some examples are as follows. Note that the contraction into basic relationships, with reparsing and annotation into canonical form to make use easy for computers, sometimes gives a rather stilted ""bad English"" presentation. Automatic extraction of relevant text prior to this processing, with references, is also accessible for easy human reading.The following shows the amino acid sequence (in standard IUPAC one letter code: see Table 1 ) for 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein QHD43416.1, deduced from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome, GenBank: MN908947.3. Technically speaking, the existence and nature of the spike (S) glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV is theoretical, being the computed translation of a predicted ORF (open reading frame), as far as in known to the author at the present time. However, comparisons with SARS would make any alternative interpretations unlikely even prior to the recent naming as a SARS type. The very recent close match with a SARS virus entry in the databases makes the assumptions used in the present paper much more plausible, however. As described in Ref. [36] a Q-UEL tag obtaining an ORF (open reading frame) from GenBank is only slightly different from that in Ref. [36] which was a specification suited to human mitochondrial genomics.There is a similar Q-UEL-ORF-AA-2RY-STRUCTURE tag that also carries a secondary structure prediction, usually in terms of h (α-helix), e (extended chain, β-pleated sheet) or c (coil or loop) as the conformational state of each amino acid residue. Such tags, along with QUEL-ORF-AA-CONSENSUS-SEQUENCE tags, help ratify that the translation is plausibly a real one and give insight into structure and function. Consensus tags show sequences of amino acid residues in the translated ORF that are usually associated with posttranslational modifications, binding and catalytic sites etc.,. For example, in the above putative 2019-nCoV S protein there are 20 occurrences of N (asparagine) followed by a residue that is not P (proline) which is followed in turn by S (serine) or T (threonine) at which glycosylation is likely to occur, followed by a residue that is not P (proline). This is typical of an extracellular protein. The secondary structure prediction extracted is shown below along with the known cleavage sites from the SARS spike protein are shown short sections of SARS sequence at which cleavage occurs, with the arginine R at which the cut occurs in indicated by the character ^. Underneath is shown (as strings of characters, h, e, c) which are the secondary structure prediction using the GOR method [39] , in Version IV available at the Rhone-Alpes Protein Institute of Biology and Chemistry website [40] . There is not a Q-UEL tag as yet that combines such cleavage site sequences with a larger amino acid sequence, although alignment tags and similar BLAST result tags can be used to play a similar role, and if cleavage site rules for a protease are included in the dictionary of consensus sequence, they would at least show the amino acid residue at the point of the cut (e.g. K lysine or R arginine in the case of trypsin) or its immediate vicinity.The purpose is here was not to predict secondary structure in the context of the folded protein structure (the ""native conformation"") which known experimentally for SARS [4, 7] and likely to be similar to the 2019-nCoV glycoprotein. Indeed, secondary structure could ultimately be deduced that way in fairly high resolution, e.g. terms of dihedral angles expressed in terms of 9 x 9 ranges (e.g. A38G18T38T29…) [11] , although doubtless there will then ultimately be found to be significant differences between 2019-nCoV and SARS at that level of resolution, especially considering that the difference in sequence is significant. Rather the purpose is otherwise, and twofold. The first purpose is simply based on the empirical finding of the author that residues predicting as coil or loop c tend to form a good basis for peptides chosen in the design of diagnostics and vaccines (see discussion later below), irrespective of whether the prediction is correct and irrespective of rules for water-liking character, exposure, or intrinsic immunogenicity (discussed later below), albeit that they naturally overlap. The second is to give the peptide designer some idea of the likely most populated conformation of residues as h, e, and c (and for some more detailed kinds of prediction, types of helix, sheet, turn or bend, and so on). The latter is in regard to the conformational behavior of peptides that are copied or modeled from local regions of the sequence and are of some 20 to 25 amino acid residues in length or less. When synthesized as peptides, they likely exist in solution as an open dynamic, random configuration that may be envisaged a statistical mechanical average over many overall conformations of similar energy, corresponding more to the above prediction. The prediction used here deliberately does not include the strong influence on and perturbation of intrinsically preferred residue conformation that occurs when the amino acid residue must fit into the rest of the folded structure, i.e. the so-called tertiary interactions. GOR method predictions that also make use of alignment of sequences from many homologous proteins were not used, because they are deliberately designed to be influenced by the conformational preferences of residues in compact folded motifs. Similarly the intrinsic Q-UEL learning approach applied to predicting secondary structure [34] was not used. Fig. 2 in that paper illustrates the point. It shows that after circa 150 arbitrarily selected proteins are brought into the training set., the predictions begin to change and improve dramatically as more and more homologous proteins of similar folded structure are encountered and the coverage of sampled proteins spans the commoner protein families Obvious pre-known homologues were discarded in that study [34] , but the above concern still applies.These two sites are prominent but not alone amongst the cleavage points that researchers have discovered in the SARS spike protein. MARPLE with XTRACTOR was able to extract from the World Wide Web a number of sequences that were cleaved by various proteases, including refs [5, 6] . Ref [5] also noted 11 potential sites for trypsin, plasmin and Transmembrane protease TMPRSS11a. Others extracted from Websites included also the following In general the sequence in the S2 0 region LKPTKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLA-DAGFMK was already looking of particular interest because of the variety of proteins that can cleave within those regions and potentially activate the virus for cell entry, including trypsin, elastase, plasmin, TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2, and TMPR11a. There are diverse types of proteases present in the human lung include various serine, cysteinyl, aspartyl and metalloproteases. These can for the most part function extracellularly as well intracellularly to perform a variety of normal functions such as neutrophil chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, mucin expression, and not least viral and bacterial destruction, a function which could a priori be involved in coronavirus spike activation for any of the above proteins, albeit likely to different extents. However, the above region is by no means the only region in which proteolysis could occur, as exemplified above.As of 1/29/2020, the closest homology (sequence match) of the whole 2019-nCoV sequence (other than with its own entry at 100%) was 81% with the spike protein of the Bat SARS-like coronavirus, sequence ID GenBank entry AVP78031.1, with 100% coverage. Sequences of the same name as entry that matched closely were AVP78042.1 at 80.32% and ATO98205.1 at 77.07%. All the top matches are bat host species.Three matches at 83-84% were noted in early studies but they were not listed as matches recently (the reason is unclear). The remaining closely matching sequences out of the top 100 have coverage 98%-100% and matches are in the range 77.04%-77.38%. That is however somewhat deceptive. For example, by searching specifically for spike glycoprotein sequences related to host as pig Sus scrofa one obtains a variety of matches with only circa 30%-31% homology and 56% coverage which is typically regarded as very weak. A common rule of thumb is that more than 30% identity over the entire lengths is required for significance, because higher identities are seen by chance in short alignments. However, as is not infrequently the case in homology studies, the assumption of meaningful homology and alignment is strengthened by known common function and suspected common ancestry of the proteins and by persuasive matches of sections, often of known functional significance.As might be expected from the above considerations, searching not on the whole sequence but only on the two sections around the two arginine cleavage sites reveals a broader variety of coronaviruses with host species, human, bat, pig, and civet. This group of species has a relatively close set of matches in the regions of S1/S2 and S2 0 sites and this is of interest because it illustrates the kind of acceptable mutations, and in synthetic peptides, substitutions, of single amino acid residues that can occur near the cleavage points, i.e. the kinds of variations and alternatives that may be of interest in peptide design uncluttered by too many variations. All of human, bat, pig, and civet host species were encountered when searching with the S1/S2 or ""PIGAG""-containing motif sequence, called PIGAG for short. That is, it matches with coronavirus isolates from human, bat, pig, and civet. Some arbitrary examples selected to show patterns in variation are as follows. These are summaries of alignments made as discussed in Section 3.4. While showing significant variation in the case of pig, becoming a PLGDG motif, the essential sequence features and the 2019-nCoV cleaved arginine R is still retained.The S2′ or ""FIEDLL""-containing motif sequence, called FIEDLL for short, also matches with coronavirus isolates from human, bat and pig. Examples are as follows. While showing significant variation in the case of pig, the KRSFIEDLL sequence is highly conserved and hence the cleaved arginine R is still retained.Note that the section KRSFIEDLLFNKV is highly conserved overall apart from a tyrosine (Y) replacement for the second phenylalanine (F) in one case, and this pattern is seen over a broader set of alignments. Again, isolates of coronavirus from pig were a notable distinct but related group. VLGVSVYDPASGRVVQ and FNKVVTNGLGTVDEDYKRC around (bounding) KRSFIEDLL are sufficient markers by close match for identifying pig diarrhea epidemic coronaviruses. Amongst any spike glycoprotein sequences examined, NVL was a common triplet occurring triplet often occurring twice in many other spike glycoproteins, e.g., bat[BtRf-BetaCoV/HeN2013] AIA62339.1, which also have the FIEDLL motif, but unless it shortly preceded the FIEDLL motif as in NVLGVSVYDPAS GRVVQKRSFIEDLLNKVVT [Pig epi. diarrhea v.] ID: ALB35880.1 the internal match with the FIEDLL motif is not significant and the NVL and following sequence usually carry no cleavage arginine R at the corresponding point.A variety of standard bioinformatics formats have been explored for Q-UEL attributes that express alignment of biosequences, finally settling on a few user-selected options that are most popular with the author and his collaborators [36] . It is a ""movable attribute"" (meaning that it can optionally appear in many kinds of tags) because in genomics, sequences are usually compared with a universally agreed reference standard in order to help the original alignment, detect possible errors, and highlight variations. In the present study, they often appeared in Q-UEL-ORF--PROTEIN tags concerning an ORF for the spike protein of a coronavirus that is not 2019-nCoV and the sequence that is analogous to the reference sequence in Ref. [36] is 2019-nCoV. Evidently, this choice of tag vehicle is somewhat arbitrary and the ""reference standard"" is only appropriate for a specific virus project of the present kind. Also, use of BLASTP [38] dominated the present project (in contrast with the previous genomic study that also made extensive use of alignment technology related to CLUSTALW [36] ). Pairwise alignments are already naturally generated by BLASTP, so that format was used. It comprises use of blanks for non-matches and a plus 'þ' for a conservative difference, i.e. the amino acids matching are not identical, but a similar type of amino acid. The default notion of ""similar"" in is not, however, the same as in Table 1 above. An example attribute concerning a section of sequence as follows (see Ref. [36] for extension to span a whole gene or protein).Below, however, matches are reported in the more familiar output from BLASTP as it actually appeared at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast. cgi, with the ""Query"" being usually MN908947 S protein (note, now at the top), and the 'Subjct' being one of the proteins found to match with it (note, now at the bottom).As noted above, by searching specifically for spike glycoprotein sequences related to host as pig Sus scrofa one obtains many matches with only circa 30%-31% homology and 56% coverage with weak but persuasive matches of sections. The interest point alluded to above is that while the so-called FIEDLL motif clearly evident and retains the cleavage arginine R, though the PIGAG motif is essentially missing, here more correctly meaning that it is highly modified with the cleavage arginine R missing. The alignment in the region of the two cleavage sites is as follows, with the extent of the cleavage segments as mostly discussed above underlined. ""Query"" indicates the 2019-nCoV sequence and the Sbjct a pig virus sequence such as GenBank AZL47249.1 also typical of a large number of pig diarrhea coronaviruses differing by just one or two amino acid residue differences in the spike protein, and which did not align well particularly on the N-terminal side of the FIEDL motif.Compare for example variations in the ""PIGAG"" region of S glycoprotein [SARS coronavirus BJ302] ID: AAR07628 with respect to the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein where there are significant variations in the vicinity but in which the PIGAG motif is preserved, and the cleavage arginine is found. and similarly in glycoprotein [BtRf-BetaCoV/HeN2013] Sequence ID: AIA62339.In consequence of the loss of the ""PIGAG"" site and cleavage arginine in some cases, the focus is on the S2' section DPSKPSKRSFIEDLLFNKV (the arginine constituting the cleavage point is underlined). The ""PIGAG"" site would not be so suitable for designs based on the assumption of binding to a protease, and in general would seem to promise an increased ability for the virus to escape, by mutation, any successful vaccine or therapeutic based on that region. Admittedly, the vicinity of the ""FIEDLL"" site can show great variation, but KRSFIEDLLFNKV tends to be well preserved, e.g. as in alignment with Pig S protein ID:QGV12784.1.Peptides that mimic part of a protein of protein sequence in terms of amino acid sequence and, by intent, the biological function or an inhibitor of it, are often referred to as peptidomimetics. Some authors use the term more specifically for analogues that are not dependent on an immune response, but act as an antagonist to, in this case, binding or cleavage. From the point of synthesis of a peptide as a plausible analogue of an immunogenic part (""epitope"") of a protein for development of diagnostics and the peptide of interest is:The rationale is that the section KRSFIEDLLFNKV is exposed as associated with S2 0 at the surface but highly conserved as shown in the second (i.e. ""FIEDLL"") alignment in Section 4.3. To bring it to the length of circa 20 amino acid residues considered in the author's experience (and frequently by other workers) as most suitable as a basis of a B-epitope for vaccine and diagnostic design, it was noted that the preceding serine (S) and following leucine (L) and alanine (A) are found in 2019-nCoV, well conserved in human host (AAR07628.1) and bat host species, and represent fairly conservative substitutions in the next most related coronaviruses, the pig host species. The remaining principles used in this design are summarized at the end of Section 4.6 alongside the similar discussion for a peptidomimetic, because the method of design (as is typical for epitopes in synthetic peptide vaccines) is based on rules-ofthumb as discussed in that Section, and are similar in the two cases. The choice is supported by the fact that it corresponds to an exposed loop in the SARS coronavirus, which will be important for raising antibodies. The ends of the peptides will have amino and carboxyl groups (shown above), which are linked to the rest of the protein sequence by neutral peptide links. The ends of the peptide are thus selected on the rationale that (a) the exposed N-terminal NH 3 þ -glycine (G) mimics (albeit imperfectly) the positively charged lysine (K) in the KPS triplet and (b) cysteine-(COO À ) provides a means for a Cys-S-S-Cys disulfide link to a carrier protein and the exposed carboxy terminus mimics (again albeit imperfectly) the aspartate (D) in the LAD triplet. A carrier protein is required to be added for antibody production and T-system memory, because short peptides have limited antigenicity. Keyhole limpet haemocyanin is often used, at least for raising antibodies, and for early stage vaccine studies, using laboratory animals. It is derived from the limpet, a gastropod; it is phylogenetically distant from mammalian proteins, thus reducing false positives in immunologically-based research techniques in mammalian model organisms, and clinically avoiding autoimmune effects. Some further conventional wisdom for selection of amino acid residues to synthesize as peptides and used as the basis of diagnostics and vaccines is as follows. Concerns are for raising antibodies (B immune system), implanting immune system memory in the case of vaccines), and specificity, and avoiding unwanted cross reactions with other proteins with similar epitopes to the target protein of interest. The peptide length should in general best be 10-20 amino acids of which many but not all are significantly polar (hydrophilic, water-liking) (residues in the set [STDENQKRHYP]). The length is thus considered appropriate at 20 amino acid residues. Tackling the issue of avoiding potential immunological crossreactivity with other human proteins, the closest match of the appropriate corresponding non-terminal sequence KGPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVT-LACD with human genome protein products in GenBank is as follows.The match at 56% identity with 77% coverage is with tumor protein D55 isoform 2 [Homo sapiens], ID: NP_001001874.2, and similarly with Tumor protein D52-like 3 [Homo sapiens] ID: AAH33792.1. Next match is in regard to neprilsyn entries at only 56% match and 55% coverage. These matches are unlikely to be of concern.Conventional wisdom in designing peptides as the basis of diagnostics and vaccines is also that one should avoid pairs or triplets etc. of proline (P) or serine (S) and RG pairs that are in common motifs with special functional roles. There is a pair PS in the candidate peptide but that doublet has not been a concern in the author's experience. Asparagine (N) and serine (S) or threonine (T) should be avoided in patterns NXS or NXT (where X is not a proline) because the S or T is likely to be glycosylated in extracellular proteins, unless the designer is going to arrange for glycosylation of the synthetic peptide. That is not an issue in any significant coronavirus matches here. Cysteine C should be avoided (perhaps replaced by serine S) not least because of the formation of unwanted Cys-Cys S-S disulfide bonds, although at either end of the peptide a Cys (C) already present or added can provide the link to a carrier protein that is essential for B immune system antibody response and T system memory. In general, it is information-rich content for binding in terms of polar and nonpolar (hydrophobic, water hating) that matters. Conventional wisdom also says avoid extensive stretches of strongly nonpolar amino acids (residues VLIFW), although extensive hydrophobicity is also considered the characteristic feature of immunogenic MHC Class I T cell epitopes, and some epitopes can play a dual B and T epitope role. Patterns of hydrophobic residues interspersed by hydrophilic residues are considered by many as essential for immunogenicity, and in the author's experience residues with sidechains that are partly polar and partly nonpolar, notably tyrosine Y and histidine H, seem particularly helpful in terms of immunogenicity. Researchers also sometimes avoid N-terminal asparagine N and glutamine Q, and C-terminal proline P and glycine G. These are not considered to be an issue as regards the immunogenic purposes of the above candidate.Simple rules-of-thumb for design of peptides, which for the most part can certainly be automated, are based on the appropriate section or sections of sequence in the protein of the pathogen that one wishes to ""attack"", and its variations in strongly and weakly related viruses. They take less consideration of the human host proteins that cleave it by proteolysis or bind to it. However, knowledge of the human protein involved would certainly be useful for some features of design, not least because one might use it as an experimental and computational model. One might expect amino acid sequences in peptide and protein substrates cleaved by airway proteases to relate to those cleaved in the S glycoprotein. Unfortunately, this is not obviously apparent at the sequence level, as further discussed in Section 4.7 below. Type II transmembrane serine proteases are likely targets for cleavage activation of 2019-nCoV based on studies of SARS-CoV, but they still require clarification as to the natural sequences typically cleaved, and as discussed in Section 4.7, the relation between KRSFIEDLLFNKV from 2019-nCoV and a model substrate sequence for type II transmembrane serine proteases, AEAALRKLLEVA, is probably not significant. Trypsin cleaves peptides on the C-terminal side of lysine (K) and arginine (R) amino acid residues. If a proline residue (P) is on either side, cleavage is impeded. The zinc-based angiotensin converting enzyme ACE can cleave at cleavage sites (L|F)(H|R|K)L (where the vertical bar '|' separates alternatives), and converts Angiotensin I DRVYIHPFHL to angiotensin II DRVYIHPF. While there are certain suggestive stretches of sequence in coronaviruses that weakly resemble angiotensin, e.g. RVVHPALHL in AVP78050.1 and ATYYHPNIRVGVFHD in ADV71747.1, none correspond to or lie near to the trypsin cleavage points in the SARS S glycoprotein. At best they only imaginatively match the S2 0 segment DPSKPSKRSFIEDLL, though the DP (aspartate-proline) in that is suggestive of some features of ACE inhibitors [41] . There is no obvious relation of the S protein cleavage sites with angiotensinogen.A major difficulty with peptides as pharmaceutical agents is that they lack biostability. They are readily cleaved by proteases, in part a protective and disposal mechanism of the body (albeit one that is used to advantage by the coronaviruses). Also, by being susceptible to partial proteolysis they can, if large enough or by binding to endogenous proteins, cause unwanted immune effects. Judicious use of D (dextro) amino acids, mirror images of their natural L (laevo) counterparts, enhances biostability because they cannot be recognized by common proteases of the body, Consequently peptides containing them will not be degraded easily and have a longer-lasting effect as both vaccines and inhibitor drugs [42] [43] [44] . Inserting just a few D-amino acids amongst many L-amino acid residues requires some difficult design and much trial and error, although an exception is the C-terminal conjugation of D-amino acids or glycosides to L-peptides that usually provides a simple way to gain long-term biostability. Because of its relative simplicity and the theoretical basis, the retroinverso approach is regaining some popularity [45] . The retroinverso analog of a natural polypeptide is entirely composed of D-amino acids but can sometimes mimic the structure and function of the natural peptide. These analogues have peptide sequence in reverse direction with respect to natural peptide and also have chirality of amino acid inverted from L to D. In other words, the sequence is synthesized backwards, last residue first, and D amino acids are used instead of L. The overall effect is that leaves the sidechains on the original side of the peptide backbone, the one disadvantage being the amide N-H and carbonyl C--O groups are interchanged in the backbone. The problem is probably not so much that a different conformation is achieved in general, since the sidechains are potentially correctly placed and there is some induction by interactions with the receiving protein binding site (in the present case, the lung proteases) just as for a surface loop in the originating protein (in the present case, the spike glycoprotein). Rather, it is that if one or more N-H⋯O--C (i.e. amide group…carbonyl group) hydrogen bonds are formed between the backbone of the loop on the originating protein and the binding site, they will now be unstable NH⋯HN or C--O⋯O--C interactions, unless accommodated correctly by conformational change or intervening water. The latter is not unreasonable, since simulations of peptides in water have shown that one or two water molecules can often intervene even between correctly paired NH and O--C groups in the manner N-H⋯O-H⋯O--C. [46] , typically by pointing water hydrogen atoms at the oxygen lone pair electron clouds or positions in which they would occur if represented [47] . More easy to handle is the problem that the terminal amino (NH 3 þ ) and carboxyl (COO À ) groups are also interchanged. As well as being retroinverso, there should be modifications of the sequence to accommodate these termini. Consequently the original sequence below is replaced by the one below that to emulate a lysine (K) at the new N-terminus and an aspartate (D) at the C-terminus. Neither of the first L-peptide or following D-peptide corresponds simply to the peptide that would be synthesized as the original well conserved KRSFIEDLLFNKV sequence. The steps in defining the details in these sequences are drawn from personal experience and common known practices [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , various published sources (e.g. Refs. [13, [49] [50] [51] [52] ), experimental studies of binding and cleavage studies specifically on SARS-CoV and other relevant systems (e.g. Refs. [53] [54] [55] [56] ), related SARS-CoV studies on smaller ligands (e.g. Refs. [53] [54] [55] [56] ) discussed later below, and general studies of ligand binding to proteins when hydrophobic groups or hydrogen bonding groups are removed or inserted (e.g. Ref. [57] ). Fortunately (not least because capturing expertise for automation is of interest), it possible to write down a core set of rules that have endured, and which explain with the choices of peptides above, once the section of sequence of interest has been determined by bioinformatics methods. These rules are innately logical and extensible to other studies of this general kind. The one debatable exception to this not seen above but seen in the original proposal for the retroinverso peptide [2] is the proline (P) that substituted for arginine (R) in the end section RKSPC of the retroinverso peptidomimetic shown above. This is discussed in Discussion and Conclusions Section 5.2. The primary rules of thumb used are as follows. First recall the sequence in the Wuhan seafood market isolate in this region as follows. Fig. 3 . Emodin, found elsewhere to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV entry, has some binding features involving the ketone group that are akin to carbenoxelone and to a number of molecules that may be considered as substructures of carbenoxelone's steroid-like ring.To compare, an alternative to the part in brackets is RRSFIDELAFGRG: it is an example of a tentative specific design ""hunch"" based on a section of a human semaphorin (GenBank NP_001243276.1) produced in response to lung diseases, a suggestive biologically-related match with conservative replacements but not one suggested by the general rules and probably coincidental. In the first peptide suitable for as a candidate for a peptide vaccine, the principles, once given the core KRSFIEDLLFNKV sequence motif, are as follows. This is to add a C-terminal cysteine (C) as a linkage (other chemical linkages are certainly possible) to the carrier, connected by a moderately flexible TLA (threonine-leucine-alanine) arm. This is found at the same locus in the conservatively retained in other coronaviruses. The sequence is specifically after LA because the -(COO À ) terminus of the protein will mimic the aspartate (D) found in that position in the original sequence (but not, accordingly, in the peptide modeling the epitope). At the C-terminus is also a similarity in that a cystine S-S bridge residue is found on the right (C-terminal side) of this section in the natural sequence, albeit that this is probably not a significant consideration because the naturally occurring C is 11 residues way. Similarly at the N-terminus, the truncation is immediately following an lysine (K) because an amino terminal (NH 3 þ )-mimics it. However, a glycine (G) is included to give flexibility and length consistent with mimicking the lysine sidechain. For the retroinverso mimetic, after writing the sequence backward and thinking in terms of Damino acids, the use of end charges as charged sidechain mimics is reversed, or more correctly stated, the roles of positively and negatively charged sidechains used there are switched. The C terminal linker is sited where an aspartate (D) is in DPSKP…so that the -(COO À ) terminal will mimic it, while the end toward the N-terminus the sequence is truncated at NFLLD… so that the charged N-terminus can mimic the lysine (K) in KPS….. Again here, a glycine is inserted to give appropriate flexibility and length so that the lysine sidechain can be better mimicked.Simulation and molecular modeling studies of a potential agonist go beyond rules-of-thumb and clearly benefit from knowledge of the three dimensional structures, in atomic detail, of the proteins with which they interact. If the automatic vigilance methods of the author and collaborators (and indeed more standard use of the Internet by the author) have failed in this respect, then they will need to be improved. As the situation appears at this time, major simulation studies in this project will be delayed until an experimental structure of the 2019-nCoV spike protein is forthcoming which, at current rate of research on 2019-nCoV, will doubtless be soon. The experimental three dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV spike protein itself is not known at the time of writing, and as far as the author is aware at this time, those SARS CoV spke protein structures that are known are only circa 75%-81% homologous with SARS spike proteins. GenBank entry QHR63300.1 for a bat coronavirus spike protein entered on the 27 January 2020 after the present study is 97.4% homologous with SARS proteins, but again the three dimensional structure is not known, or at least not accessible to the present author. Also, protein modeling and binding studies are hampered in that the region around the S2' site of SARS-CoV is partly disordered in conformation, and require a longer period of study.The human proteins responsible for binding and for cleavage of 2019-nCoV are also not completely clear, though by now several laboratories may have a clearer picture. The recent notion that 2019-nCoV is a kind of SARS will doubtless promote that avenue of enquiry. Of course, a number of studies concerning human protein binding and activation of SARS-CoV have already, some time ago, been carried out by several groups (e.g. Refs. [53] [54] [55] ). While angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is responsible for binding SARS, it is a type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) that appears to be responsible for the activation cleavage for SARS-CoV [55] . There are several structures known on the Protein Data Bank for proteases of this general kind, including entry 20Q5 for DESC1 and 3T2N for hepsin. Several groups have examined the specificity cleavage specificity analysis of six Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases (e.g. Ref. [56] ). As noted above, there are no obvious sequence relationships between KRSFIEDLLFNKV and type II serine proteases, angiotensinogen, angiotensin 1, or various substrates on which enzymes of potential interest may act, or AEAALRKLLEVA which has been used for exploring active site docking [56] . This was deduced, in the manner of design, from studies of the cleavage specificity analysis of six type II transmembrane serine proteases using PICS (Proteomic Identification of protease Cleavage Sites) with proteome-derived peptide libraries [56] . There is no significant relationship except for the hint of reversal of charges (e.g. ED for RK) between KRSFIEDLLFNKV and the AEAALRKLLEVA peptide. A number of agents that can block binding or activation have been studied [57] [58] [59] but there appears to be a number of different mechanisms (e.g. Ref. [59] ).The conformational flexibility of the epitope and retroinverso agonist proposed above is also a challenge. That flexibility is an advantage for pharmaceutical action in vivo, because although it increases an entropy cost of binding, it is more likely to adjust to fit a binding site, and even fit different relevant sites, in the manner of a locksmith's ""skeleton key"". In that sense, peptidomimetics are tolerant of design choice: if the intended fit is not perfect, the molecule can adjust. Computationally, however, it increases a well-known problem called the multiple minima problem [11] . With 18 D-amino acid residues, dextro-[GNFLLDEIFSRKSPKSPC] with just 10 distinct conformers there are 10 18 possibilities. Even if one considers just 5 conformational states per amino acid residue (a gross underestimate), there would be 5 18 ¼ 3,814,697,265,625 distinct conformers to energy-minimize or subject to molecular dynamics to consider in the free peptide alone, often separated by significant energy barriers. To obtain deeper insight, studies have been performed exploring the intrinsic conformational preferences of KRSFIEDLLFNKV and dextro-[GNFLLDEIFSRKSPK SPC], i.e. with no receptor present, in which the most stable top hundred might be identified.The software used was the KRUNCH suite illustrated in the appendix to Ref. [48] , using a model of ""pseudoatoms"" (artificial interaction centers) representing first shell of water. The approach, described in more detail in Section 4.8, is one of molecular mechanics using energy minimization capable of exploring multiple minima, boosted by various algorithms to help explore the conformational energy space as a whole. However, many conformers of comparable low energy are found, simply supporting the idea that these candidate peptides in Section 4.6 are conformationally flexible. Starting from an extended structure, essentially e for each residue but specifically backbone dihedral angles Φ ¼ À 90 � , Ψ ¼ þ150 � , there is a preferred overall secondary structure in reasonable accord with the predictions made on the 2019-nCoV S protein made above using GOR IV for the segment PSKRSFIEDLLFNKVT, and the D-amino acid sequence in reverse is consistent with the mirror image conformation of the reverse sequence. In effect, that simply means that an α-helical conformation (and its mirror image in the D-amino acid peptide case) did not appear. There was departure from local deep minima. Notably EDLLFNK tended occasionally to adopt angles around Φ ¼ À 60 � Ψ ¼ À 50 � characteristic of α-helix, but they returned to the extended conformer. Very preliminary binding studies similar to those of Barr'e et al., but using 2019-nCoV spike protein and the retorinverso peptide suggest various modes of binding varying between circa À 11 and À 16 kcal/mol but these numbers should not be taken too seriously. Only relative values are meaningful but they have been scaled (""adjusted"") by correction factors established in previous higher grade molecular dynamics calculations [48] . In any event the above calculations do not include a potentially strong entropy contribution for each conformer (and ideally for the overall solute-solvent system).The system used to explore 2019-nCoV to host cell binding, activation and cell entry, i.e. the ""binding model"", was chosen on the basis of inhibitors common to, or similar between, (a) SARS binding, activation and entry and (b) and ligands including inhibitors of an enzyme of medical importance, as discussed here below. This model system was initially and in part simply a practice ""set up"" for relevant studies, suggested by certain relationships between the actions of small molecules revealed by auto-surfing as described below. The choice is undoubtedly likely to be of concern because it involves a human enzyme unlikely to be involved in 2019-nCoV entry. Nonetheless, it proved insightful, and consider that, until relatively recently in the history of pharmacology, ignorance of the atomic details of a protein to which a ligand (as the proposed bioactive small molecule) binds, has been the norm. Pharmacologists have used evidence and hunches to deduce a pharmacophore, i.e. an abstract description of molecular features that are necessary for molecular recognition of the ligand by the protein. The rational for the strategy used in the present study is that one can make model binding sites and draw some useful conclusions, but using the actual experimental structure of a protein known to bind similar ligands is more likely to give realistic insight. A justification is that if the pharmacophore in the target choice has no clear features to refute that choice, which the present author calls the ""target refutation principle"", then it is at least a worthy first choice as a ""straw man"", i.e. a conjecture for criticism and further debate. After all, any preliminary pharmacophore model might be later refined by adding an ""except when"" condition to its description.The choice of the target protein as model was governed by several considerations discussed below, mostly revealed by the auto-surfing approach, and motivated by the above problems of conformational flexibility for peptide ligands. Other investigations by the author and collaborators have focused on rigid, steroid-like scaffolds for binding groups, and also on molecules roughly resembling steroid-like ""pieces"". In one such study [48] , using as the lead a known inhibitor and a steroid-like plant derivative called carbenoxolone, a list of such ""pieces"" and related molecules screened for binding more at least a superficial resemblance to emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone). This compound came to attention as important in the present study because the ""auto-surfing"" found that emodin has already been shown to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV entry [57, 58] . See Fig. 3 . Thus by analogy, it is a putative antagonist for 2019-nCoV entry. Even more importantly, it was found that several studies (e.g. Ref. [60] have shown that emodin, carbenoxelone (again, see Fig. 3 ), and other molecules with some similarity can inhibit 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in rodents and humans. The experimental structure of this enzyme is available with bound carbenoxolone (Protein Data Bank entry 2BEL; the structure also includes the NADP cofactor). In a series of anthraquinone compounds shown to inhibit the steroid-processing enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 of both humans and mice, emodin was identified as the most potent selected [60] .The KRUNCH method of molecular modeling used [48, 62, 63] is not commercially available although the molecular dynamics, docking and other parts of the suit as a whole are essentially the same as standard available versions, and have in the past sometimes been replaced by the standard available versions [48] . The core approach, which is of less usual character, is predominantly concerned with conformational space, not phase space based on molecular dynamics with a dimension of simulated time. This core approach is a descendant of earlier developments in protein and peptide modeling [11] that did not simulate Newtonian dynamics but rather they applied energy minimization techniques, and in particular those called Simplex methods [11] . Because they do not depend on continuous derivatives these methods can navigate a potential energy surface pitted with multiple small energy minima [11, 63] . This approach is then extended in pursuit of identifying the global minimum or minima by a Globex method that looks for trends in deep minima on the larger scale [11] , and then finally embellished by a variety of techniques that explore conformational space efficiently [63] . Roughly speaking, however, history of a simulation gives a similar impression to molecular dynamics, albeit run at high temperatures with periods of cooling or annealing.Initial binding studies using 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as ""receptor"" and activator of the virus are similar to those used in Ref. [48] . Early alternative choices of binding protein as model included growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 GenPept accession NP_796304 because of some evidence in the literature of the action of anthraquinone, emoghrelin derivatives, and indanthrone, amongst others, which have some of the features of emodin, and because of an initial suspicion that a sequence segment in growth hormone receptor might contribute to binding and had some features relating to the current peptide of interest, but none of the alternatives were ultimately seen as persuasive as the steroid dehydrogenase choice. Preliminary studies in the present project also suggested possible similarities of binding to the active site of steroid dehydrogenase between (a) the peptide epitope proposed above, (b) the retroinverso peptidomimetic, (c) a compound carbenoxelone already studied somewhat intensively by the author and collaborators [48] , and (d) emodin. See below. Although initial results for binding of the peptides À 8 to À 10 kcal/mol initially seemed promising, emodin and carbenoxelone bound significantly lower as discussed below, and the peptide binding differed by showing multiple similar energy binding modes.Although the dehydrogenase is a very different model system to any directly relating to 2019-nCoV, there were some interesting observations regarding emodin binding that might be extensible to more relevant simulations in a manner consistent with the above ""target refutation principle"". Using the software described in Ref. [62] and the appendix to Ref. [48] , initial studies comprised simply superimposing the smaller analogues into the steroid core of carbenoxolone using the position of the analogous ketone O11 atom on C11 of the steroid-like framework of carbenoxelone and serine 170 side chain oxygen atom as a pivot, removing the carbenoxolone, and initially locally minimizing the energy of the new enzyme-ligand system. Conformational changes of the enzyme on replacing by emodin depended critically on choice of dialectric constant, values less than 20 gave less than 1.9 Å rms. In practice, one conventional rule of thumb is that each aromatic ring can contribute up to about À 1.7 kcal/mol in going from an aqueous to a non-polar environment. But although carbenoxolone is steroid-like, and so expected to fit in very hydrophobic pockets, there is ample evidence that there is often hydrogen bonding occurring between steroids and their receptors [61] . In the present system, however, despite significant and differing conformational adjustments by the protein to accommodate these two ligands, there is a negative electrostatic tension in the region of the ketone group because due to close approach of the serine 170 side chain oxygen atom the phenolic oxygen of Tyr 183 and also by oxygen O7N in the NADP cofactor. These electrostatic tensions would seem to provide evidence against the choice of the target protein according to the above target refutation principle. However, it is to be recalled that there is catalysis to consider (including a serine protease type of mechanism) for the proteolysis that is believed to be required to activate the virus for entry. Also, this is at a cut at the lysine residue following an arginine, both carrying a positively charged sidechain. Consequently, relevance cannot be dismissed. Also of course, binding can be favorable overall. Indeed, despite the electrostatic tension, binding energies of À 11 and À 16 kcal/mol (again adjusted against previous high grade calculations as in Section 4.7) were obtained for emodin and carbenoxelone respectively which seem reasonable indicators of significant binding. Again, however, such values should not be taken as predictions of experimental binding free energy because the above comments on relative values and entropy still apply for the overall solute-solvent system even though the ligands themselves are much more rigid. Other compounds containing one or few steroid-like rings such as (2,3)-dithio-6-hydroxy-8-carboxy- (1, 7, 9) -azanaphthalene showed as binding similarly in some binding simulation methods but not in others, and when binding showed multiple binding modes.Recall that it is the L-amino sequence GPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLAC that was proposed as an B-epitope to be synthesized with L amino acids and attached to a carrier, for purposes of raising antibodies as a diagnostics, or as a potential vaccine. In the letter case it might require an additional peptide as a T-epitope (for immune system memory), which might come from anywhere in the S protein or even elsewhere in virus, and perhaps other agents such as molecular adjuvant. These are known considerations in the state of the art [50, 51] , although vaccines based on this synthetic approach are still relatively disfavored for human use despite being in increased use in veterinary medicine. The reason may in part be the historical difficulty in synthesizing longer peptides without side reactions and accumulative errors in the insertions of the amino acids, but now whole proteins can be synthesized, even out of D-amino acids (in which case they fold in mirror image of the native form) [43] . It is increasingly held that the synthetic peptide vaccine approach can sometimes be more effective than traditional vaccine methods [50] , and it has been steadily increasing in popularity [51] . The main problem to overcome for vaccine and diagnostic design, with some analogous issues for therapeutic peptidomimetics, seems to be that in many pathogens, the B epitope antigenic determinants for antibody production are discontinuous sections of sequence, and using just one of them typically delivers poor results [51] . However, since sections can be linked chemically with runs of connecting amino acids such as glycine, this is, strictly speaking, just a further layer of design, especially if the three dimensional structure of the protein is known. For the immediate future, that will probably still require a significant amount of experimental trial and error to refine the design, but it is certainly facilitated if one can first obtain activity from studies on different continuous epitopes, ultimately linking the peptides together as above.Recall also that is was D-amino acid sequence GNFLLDEIFSRKSRKSPC that was proposed for synthesis from D-amino acids to act as an antagonist to viral entry. The reason for the retroinverso approach is that an L-peptide would be susceptible to proteolysis from a variety of human proteins. In silico (computer simulations) make it possible to use both an L-peptide and D-peptide, as standard molecular mechanics or dynamics will not emulate catalysis (and it would take a remarkably sophisticated and fast quantum mechanical calculation to do so), and the L-peptide results may also be helpful in the design process. In vivo, a D-peptide would have a much longer half-life to work either at the human protein required for binding, most often believed to be the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) as responsible for binding SARS-CoV to lung cells, or as an inhibitor preventing proteolysis required for activation of the S spike protein. At the time of writing, it is the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 that is favored as responsible for the activation cleavage. The author favors the inhibition of proteolysis. If the peptide is correct, at least we know form the SARS spike protein experiments that the lysine (K) in the terminal segment PKSPC corresponds to the proteolytic cleavage point in the segment PSKRS. There must be a sufficient degree of binding of an inhibitor to the active (i.e. catalytic) site and many competitive inhibitors work by binding reversibly to it. It is a common view even to the point of view of some authors defining competitive inhibition that way. However, the main binding and recognition site may not be the same thing, and there are also mechanisms by which an enzyme may bind either the inhibitor or the substrate but never both at the same time. Allosteric interactions allow competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetitive inhibition, and the peptide binding at another site could act to enhance enzyme activity (and so act as an agonist to viral entry). Certainly a practical advantage of focusing on the protease in the laboratory is that its inhibition can initially be tested without having to use virus or virus protein. Strictly speaking it is the relative strengths of binding virus and peptide that matter, but this is not generally seen as a serious obstacle in practice.The original proposal for the retroinverso compound [2] suggested a proline (P) to substitute for arginine (R) in the end section RKSPC. This modification had somewhat the status of a ""hunch"" and is at best a ""weak rule"" in the sense of Section 5.3 below. Having been demoted in the present paper it would seem hardly worthy of mention here except that proline has played a recurrent high profile role in the history of design of peptidomimetics, and the modification might still be worth considering if binding of the recommended retroinverso peptide is negligible or weak. Briefly, the various ideas used in the president study involved considering the advantages of a proline residue lacking an NH group that in the retroinverso peptide was suspected to involve an unfavorable N-H.H-N interaction, and a different flexibility at that critical point in which peptide bond cis-trans isomerization replaced extensive N-Cα rotation. There was also a concern that residual L or specific D proteolysis or racemization to L can still occur at some points in a D-amino acid residue sequence. However, the former stereochemical considerations apply to the steroid processing enzyme as the binding and inhibitor model, not necessarily to the lung proteases, and even in considering the former model there are also some objections, discussion of which is beyond current scope.There has been an argument amongst pharmaceutical scientists that, especially at early stages of a study, bioinformatics combined with hunches of the experienced pharmaceutical synthetic chemistry can often provide more reliable guidelines than, for example computational ligand-protein binding simulations that are hampered by the complexity of conformation space [63] . At least, for some decades investigation by bioinformatics has been considered as an important early step, certainly in the views of the present author and collaborators [64] [65] [66] . The main role of the project described in the present paper was initially to describe bioinformatics strategies, rather than binding studies, that have worked in other cases as discussed briefly shortly below, and to explore automation. Compared with the tasks of automating protein modeling and drug design in which the present author has been involved (e.g. Refs. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] 48] ) it seems clear that the above relatively simple series of bioinformatics steps can readily be automated. The main tasks are for this kind of work are (a) detecting those sequences that are conserved in a surface protein across a viral (and potentially bacterial or parasitic) group of organisms, strain and likely to be exposed to the exterior (prediction of coil C helps here as discussed in the text), and (b) programming the set of rules for the detailed choice of amino acid residue sequence and changes to it. Section 4.6 gave a set of rules for the present study that are readily automatable, and those rules are essentially the ones that have stood the test of time and appear logically justified. For design of synthetic vaccines, such automation has already been extensively implemented as prediction software by many workers [49] . All these are essentially tools for predictions, and they are rules-of-thumb particularly in the sense that they may not work in very case, and may needed to be adjusted on a trial-and-error basis. There are also ""weak"" rules for which evidence for general applicability is questionable, but which could work in a few special cases. The only ""rule"" in the original specification of Section 4.6 that on further consideration lacked generality, is that for proline discussed above in Section 5.3.Currently, computational chemistry, protein modeling, and binding simulations are popular tools. In practice, however, they must be used with caution because of complexity of the conformational space and, related to that, strong entropic contributions, including of course from the surrounding solvent. This is probably the main reason why IBM's very high performance computer Blue Gene, originally developed on the premise by some workers (including the present author) that it might be able to predict at least the three dimensional structure of some smaller proteins by folding simulation lasting for about a year of computer time [63] , did not succeed. It did however achieve many insights into protein modeling as discussed in Ref. [63] , and went on to have other applications, including drug design based on reading all US patents at the time, and evolving designs by DOCK and molecular dynamics simulations [48] . The scaling ""adjustment"" factors use in the molecular mechanics KRUNCH approach in Section 4.8 also depended on these more sophisticated, high grade simulations [48] . Other sources of error includes also (typically) include neglect of quantum mechanical contributions, neglecting quantization of vibrations and with modeling based primarily with atoms representing centers of interaction, essentially meaning limitations in potential functions, which in turn may largely mean neglect of changes in interactions and interaction centers in the environment of other electrical fields.From the preliminary conformation and binding studies carried out in the present study, one may conclude that these approaches are, for the proposed peptides, challenging by involving many degrees of freedom, both in the conformational and general sense. Simulation methods need to be enhanced by methods that can assess protein and protein-ligand interaction model (e.g. Ref. [62] ), and heuristics for overcoming the multiple minimum problem (e.g. Ref. [63] ), but so far these particular cited approaches have not provided a quick solution on a standard personal computer..For pharmaceutical reasons too, moving toward smaller non-peptide analogues may be the best direction. It is probably best to await detailed experimental structures of viral and human proteins involved in activation, and their interaction. The electrostatic tension that applied in the above choice of pharmacophore may not make it an optimal model system, but ""computer experiments"" and incidental observations can provide useful clues and insights. In earlier studies on related compounds including carbenoxelone, converting the ketone group ¼ O to a thioketone ¼ S derivative in most of the compounds studied appeared to enhance binding at first by relaxing the electrostatic tension despite increasing increased the van der Waal's repulsion, but it was subsequently appreciated that a stronger partial charge is required for the thioketone sulfur on a benzene ring because chemically this is strongly electronegative, carrying closer to a full electron unit of charge. The C--S bond length of thiobenzophenone is 1.63 Å thioformaldehyde, but due to steric interactions, the phenyl groups are not coplanar and the dihedral angle SC-CC is 36 � . Nonetheless, the binding energy of the emodin thioketone fell by 2 kcal/mol, and this is being investigated. However, the thioketone group is not an optimal choice to explore and might well cause oligomerization in practice, but studies like that above do support the idea that other replacements to the corresponding ketone group in multiple ring substructures of the steroid-like structure might reasonably be explored in pursuit of potent analogues. Of course, the appropriate pharmacophore could be one with hydrogen bonding requirements not met with the above model.Many principles similar to those of epitope selection apply to therapeutic pepidomimetic design, at least for the relatively simple step of proposing a retroinverso candidate. It is a worthy early strategy, if only on the grounds that it shows suggestive wanted activity, or it does not, and one might well consider it unfortunate if a great deal of computational medicinal chemistry and laboratory synthesis and testing is done, only to find later that using the retroinverso approach would have created a successful first candidate at the outset. A limitation of the approach is that one must be aware of coincidental matches that are not truly significant unless one can see that the proteins being compared are essentially of the same function or family, with the order of similar sections preserved, and that the correspondences make sense in the light of background biological knowledge. Even armed with such knowledge, one must be wary of making too big a jump. A curious example from the present study is as follows. Because in the author's experience a simple reversal of the peptide sequence (i.e. using L-amino acids) can sometimes have required activity, it was interesting to also perform a BLAST search on that reverse sequence. One of the closest matches is with a close match of the above reverse sequence with a sequence in a bacterial enzyme that interconverts D and L alanine: bifunctional UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide:D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase, also known as alanine racemase. More specifically, NFLLDEIFSRKSPKS finds a similar section NFLLNEEFSVIKSPKS in the racemases ID WP_090409885.1 and WP_158209963.1. This is an interesting coincidence, but it does not (as yet) stand up to investigation. This is primarily because amino acid residues from a variety of parts of the racemase appear to interact with itssubstrate, and because the sequence is not significantly preserved in a large number of both related and diverse racemases.In the ongoing fight against infectious disease there is accelerating progress in the identification of relevant peptides and, where appropriate, design of smaller drug molecules based on them should be applied (e.g. Refs. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] ) Such progress provides many additional tools and strategies that could be used. In some cases, one might find that repurposing existing drugs or herbal extracts with suspected genuine efficacy may help in the challenge. For 2019-nCoV, the light of all that is discussed above, it is plausible that a angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, i.e. an ACE inhibitor could do the same job as a petidomimetic. It is likely that the concentrations required may have an excessive effect on lowering blood pressure, but an aerosol preparation might be useful. However, a peptidomimetic based on the above motif perhaps also delivered as an aerosol, could perhaps be more specific and have less side effects. Design or discovery of more rigid molecules with similar van der Waals's and electrostatic surfaces would be the more traditional pharmaceutical choice.In the 2011 fictional movie ""Contagion"" [73] a herbal plant supplement claimed to cure a fictional viral infection played the role of the villain compared with established mainstream methods of vaccine and drug design; however, the villainy was not in the herbal origins but rather the fraudulent experiment in the movie that claimed to support its efficacy. For example, medicinal plants are often found to have an ACE inhibitor action (e.g. ref. [74] ). Many compounds studied in works referenced in Section 4.7 were plant extracts, derivatives, or analogues. Carbenoxelone is a derivative of a product from the licorice plant already proven in clinical trials and once marketed as an anti-inflammatory treatment for stomach ulcers, and is steroid-like. Emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) can be isolated from rhubarb, buckthorn, and Japanese knotweed and is produced by many species of fungi. The preliminary comparisons with the retroinverso peptide, carbenoxelone and emodin could, of course, emerge as a coincidental similarity of the same kind as that between the reverse sequence used in the retroinverso petidomimetic and a sequence in alanine racemease discussed above.A future Thinking Web WW4 beyond the current World Wide Web and emerging Semantic Web [28] remains an important goal to facilitate the response to old and emerging diseases. It seems clear, nonetheless, that rapid access to the emerging literature and the bioinformatics tools available on the Internet, guided by a human researcher, will for some time yet remain important weapons in the battle against viruses and other pathogens.

ft9l3sur,Baricitinib as potential treatment for 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease,"Given the scale and rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory disease, there is an immediate need for medicines that can help before a vaccine can be produced. Results of rapid sequencing of 2019-nCoV, coupled with molecular modelling based on the genomes of related virus proteins, 1 have suggested a few compounds that are likely to be effective, including the anti-HIV lopinavir plus ritonavir combination.BenevolentAI's knowledge graph is a large repository of structured medical information, including numerous connections extracted from scientific literature by machine learning. 2 Together with customisations bespoke to 2019-nCoV, we used BenevolentAI to search for approved drugs that could help, focusing on those that might block the viral infection process. We identified baricitinib, which is predicted to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells.Most viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The receptor that 2019-nCoV uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cellsurface protein on cells in the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and, importantly, lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells (figure). These AT2 cells are particularly prone to viral infection. 3 One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). Disruption of AAK1 might, in turn, interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles. 4 Of 378 AAK1 inhibitors in the knowledge graph, 47 have been approved for medical use and six inhibited AAK1 with high affinity. These included a number of oncology drugs such as sunitinib and erlotinib, both of which have been shown to inhibit viral infection of cells through the inhibition of AAK1. 5 However, these compounds bring serious side-effects, and our data infer high doses to inhibit AAK1 effectively. We do not consider these drugs would be a safe therapy for a population of sick and infected people.By contrast, one of the six highaffinity AAK1-binding drugs was the janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib, which also binds the cyclin G-associated kinase, another regulator of endocytosis. 6 Because the plasma concentration of baricitinib on therapeutic dosing (either as 2 mg or 4 mg once daily) is sufficient to inhibit AAK1, we suggest it could be trialled, using an appropriate patient population with 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, to reduce both the viral entry and the inflammation in patients, using endpoints such as the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. 7 JS is editor-in-chief of Oncogene. JS has previously sat on a number of scientific advisory boards, including BenevolentAI, and has consulted with Lansdowne partners, Vitruvian, and Social Impact Capital; he now sits on the Board of Directors for BB Biotech Healthcare Trust and chairs Xerion Healthcare. All other authors are employees of BenevolentAI. Events in relation to the 2019-nCoV outbreak are evolving rapidly, and we make our initial thoughts available in this Correspondence in good faith and to assist in the global response. Our early investigations and suggestions require further detailed work and analysis and should not be relied on as constituting any kind of medical or other advice or recommendation. "
x95h80nq,"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","Identification of pathogens mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection. According to the traditional Koch's postulates, virus isolation is the ""gold standard"" for virus diagnosis in the laboratory. First, viral culture is a prerequisite for diagnosing viral infections. A variety of specimens (such as swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharynx or trachea extracts, sputum or lung tissue, blood and feces) should be retained for testing in a timely manner, which gives a higher rate of positive detection of lower respiratory tract specimens. Then, immunological methods e including immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, direct fluorescent antibody assay, MAb-based rapid NP (nucleocapsid protein) detection, semiconductor quantum dots, and the microneutralization test e which measure binding between the antigen from the whole virus or protein of the coronavirus and corresponding antibody, are easy to operate rapidly but have a lower sensitivity and specificity [3, 4] . In addition, other immunological methods, including microneutralization ppNT assay (pseudo-particle neutralization) are highly sensitive and specific by using the gene coding for the coronavirus spike protein [5, 6] . In the case of 2019-nCoV, viral research institutions can conduct preliminary identification of the virus through the classical Koch's Postulates or observing its morphology through an electron microscopy [7] . Serology could also be used to identify the virus when 2019-nCoV-associated antigens and monoclonal antibodies are developed in the future [7e9] . All the examples above are traditional virus detection methods.Viral nucleic acids can also be used for early diagnosis. The following are some of the new coronavirus detection methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biological diagnosis technology based on the sequence of nucleic acids. The full gene sequence of 2019-nCoV has now been obtained [10], so patients who are suspected of being infected with 2019-nCoV [8] can be diagnosed by pan-coronavirus PCR for virus identification [11] . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a technology combining RNA reverse transcription (RT) with polymerase chain amplification (PCR) of cDNA. A duplex RT-PCR assay can be used to detect SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using pUC57SARS-pS2 and pGEM-MERSS2 as templates, respectively [12] . Also, samples collected from the upper respiratory tract (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal) and lower respiratory tract (endotracheal aspirate, expectorated sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage) of suspected 2019-nCoV patients can be diagnosed by RT-PCR [8]. Reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (RT-iiPCR), quantitative realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR), and one-step rtRT-PCR were all further optimized [13e16]. These optimized RT-PCR methods were used to detect the MERS-CoV envelope gene (upE) and the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) or open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) genes separately. However, rtRT-PCR was used to identify 2019-nCoV through preliminary and validation detection of its E gene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, and N gene [17] .There are other molecular-based detection techniques in addition to RT-PCR and similar optimized detection techniques. For example, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an RNA amplification technique that detects the N gene of MERS-CoV and the ORF1a gene [18] . One-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP) is the optimized RT-LAMP [19] , while RT-LAMP-VF is the deformation of RT-LAMP [20] , which is the combination of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and vertical flow visualization strips. Both are used to detect the N gene of MERS-CoV, making detection easier, faster, more efficient and highly specific. Besides these three methods, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-PRA) is also used to identify MERS-CoV [21] .Finally, the following multiplex tests can detect both coronaviruses and other viruses. MCoV-MS (multiplexed CoV mass spectrometry) uses an array matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system to accurately identify known human coronaviruses (hCoVs) and to provide phylogenetic evidence for emerging unknown hCoVs [22] . Another new test method, arch-shaped multiple-target sensor, is used to amplify the target for rapid identification of pathogens in clinical samples [23] . The method can detect hCoVs, and Zika and Ebola viruses. The last one, the paper-based colorimetric assay, uses Pyrrolidinyl Peptide Nucleic Acid-induced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) aggregation of pathogen DNA testing [24] . The color change of AgNPs can distinguish between MERS-CoV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus (HPV).The cellular receptors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been identified [25, 26] , and the virion spike (S) glycoprotein, was also well studied. S glycoprotein includes two subunits [27] , S1 and S2, resulting from cleavage of the one precursor into two parts. S1 determines the virus host range and cellular tropism with the key functional domain -receptor binding domain (RBD), while S2 contains two tandem domains, heptad repeats 1 (HR1) and heptad repeats 2 (HR2), to mediate virus-cell membrane fusion. It is believed that the fusion process is similar to that of HIV-1 [28] ; for example, when S1 binds to the receptor on the cell membrane, the fusion peptide at the N terminus of S2 inserts into the cell membrane, then three HR1s attach to each other in parallel as a trimer, followed by binding of three HR2s separately onto the outside of the trimer to form a 6-helix bundle, thus bringing virus and cell membranes close to each other to trigger fusion.As the major vaccine target, the S protein has been evaluated in different types of vaccines against infection by CoVs [29] . Apart from the inactive whole virus particle [30] , live attenuated virus with gene deletion [31] , four more vaccines which mainly contain S protein were studied. These include a virus-like particle which incorporated S protein into hepatitis virus or influenza virus protein [32, 33] ; virus vectors, such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or Adenovirus carrying S protein [34, 35] ; S protein subunit vaccine, like RBD-based protein [29, 36] ; and DNA vaccine which encodes the full length or part of the S protein gene [37, 38] . Most of them have been tested in mouse models and showed the ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies. The first SARS-CoV DNA vaccine was tested in humans only 19 months after the virus sequence was published [38] , while the DNA vaccine GLS-5300, the first MERS-CoV vaccine, went to clinical trials in 2016 [39] . In addition to these conventional vaccines, Liu et al. analyzed the T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, revealed the potential cross-reactivity of the coronaviruses, and assessed the possibility of developing universal vaccines against coronavirus infections [40] .Most CoVs share a similar viral structure, similar infection pathway, and a similar structure of the S proteins [41] , suggesting that similar research strategies should also be applicable for the 2019-nCoV. For example, the study of MERS-CoV vaccines was accelerated by virtue of strategies that had been established for SARS-CoV [42] . It has been reported that the 2019-nCoV is also genetically close to SARS-CoV [43, 44] . Therefore, to predict whether vaccines developed for SARS-CoV will also be effective against 2019-nCoV infection, the full length S protein sequences from the 2019-nCoV, a SARS-CoV, and two genetically similar bat CoV strains were selected for alignment (Fig. 1) . The results indicated more than 50% homology of the viruses. However, the most variable residues are located in S1, a critical vaccine target, implying that neutralizing antibodies that were so effective against SARS-CoV infection may fail to recognize the 2019-nCoV, and that multiple amino acid differences at the receptor binding motif may modify virus tropism, a possible reason for cross-species transmission. However, several bottlenecks typically delay the approval of vaccines to prevent CoVs infection. First, a lack of proper animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy. Second, there are limitations from the S protein itself, such as mutations in the neutralization antibody epitopes in S protein that can cause virus escape [45] , or non-neutralization antibody epitopes in vaccines that may elicit antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) [46] . Third, DNA vaccines may recombine with other viruses. Fourth, pre-existing immunity may eliminate the vaccine by removing the general human virus vectors [47] . Finally, there is the problem of return on investment which may be slow and, hence, inhibit investments and slow down the clinical study.Jiang and colleagues have demonstrated that RBD in the SARS-CoV S protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients and is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and long-term protective immunity in animal models. It contains 6 different conformational neutralizing epitopes, to which a series of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with different neutralizing activity were generated. Interestingly, these mAbs exhibited cross-neutralizing activities against divergent SARS-CoV strains isolated from SARS patients at different stages of SARS epidemics in 2002e2004 and those from palm civets [48e52]. This group has also shown that these SARS-CoV-RBDspecific neutralizing mAbs can cross-neutralize bat SL-CoVs, such as bat SL-CoV-W1V1 [53] , indicating that these antibodies may also cross-neutralize 2019-nCoV. Most importantly, RBD-based vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV infection in the immunized animals, while it did not elicit ADE or other harmful immune responses, unlike the virusinactivated vaccines or full-length S protein-based vaccines as discussed above. Therefore, this RBD-based SARS vaccine is expected to be safer and more effective than the vaccines targeting other sites in S protein. Jiang and Du's groups have collaborated with Hotez's group at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and Tseng's group at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas, USA in development of an effective and safe vaccine at the late stage of preclinical study [54] . The antibodies induced by this vaccine candidate are expected to cross-neutralize 2019-nCoV infection. If it is confirmed, this vaccine candidate has the great potential to be further developed promptly in clinical trials in both China and the United State through the continuous collaborations among the four groups of Drs. Hotez, Tseng, Du, and Jiang [55].At the present, no specific antiviral therapy has been approved for treatment of infection by human CoVs. As development of vaccines and compounds for prevention and treatment of infection have been brought to priority status by WHO and governments [56] , numerous drug studies have been done or are moving forward. Some of them focus on the CoV fusion/entry process either by inhibition of S1 mediated virus attachment or by blocking of S2 mediated virus-cell membrane fusion, and some of them interfere with viral replication [57] .Based on the previous experience in developing the HIV-1 fusion inhibitor SJ-2176 [58] , Jiang et al. discovered the first anti-SARS-CoV peptide (SC-1) from the HR2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein S2 subunit. SC-1 could bind onto the HR1 domain to form a six-helical bundle (6-HB), blocking S protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibiting SARS-CoV infection [59] . When MERS-CoV was circulating in human populations in 2012, following similar mechanistic design, Jiang's research group developed another peptide, designated HR2P, which was derived from the virus HR2 region as well and effectively inhibited MERS-CoV infection [60] . The further modified version of HR2P, HR2P-M2, presented even better anti-MERS-CoV activity and pharmaceutical properties.Development of broad-spectrum pan-CoV fusion inhibitors would be an ideal way to cope with epidemics or pandemics caused by emerging HCoVs. The conservative amino acid sequence of the HR1 region across different CoVs has the potential to be a target domain for development of an inhibitor. Continuing to work on the HR1 and HR2 domains, Jiang's group discovered that the peptide OC43-HR2P, derived from the HR2 domain of HCoV-OC43, broadly inhibited fusion by multiple HCoVs. By optimization of this peptide, a pan-CoV fusion inhibitor, EK1, was generated. It could form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) structure with HR1s and showed significantly improved fusion-inhibitory activity and pharmaceutical properties [61] . The alignment of S protein in Fig. 1 exhibited 100% identity at the HR2 domains between the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV; however, they found 7 amino acid changes in the fusion core of the HR1, located in the EK1 binding motif. Fortunately, the substitutions were conservative replacements which would not dramatically disrupt the interactions between EK1 and HR1, meaning that EK1 would still have the potential to be an effective inhibitor for 2019-nCoV infection.So far, most neutralizing antibodies recognize the RBD in the S protein S2 of CoVs. Compared with the high mutation rate in the S1 protein, S2 is much more conservative, thereby decreasing the offtarget risk caused by amino acid replacement [62] , and also bypassing the special epitopes that may cause ADE [63] . This means that the cocktail of monoclonal antibodies binding to different epitopes of RBD would be more desirable for therapeutic purposes [64] . For treatment, the monoclonal antibodies are from a human source or are humanized antibodies, isolated or generated with various approaches. For example, wild-type mice were immunized with soluble recombinant RBD containing the S protein. Then mouse antibodies were humanized and isolated, or transgenic mice were directly immunized, to express human versions of the antibodies [50, 65, 66] . However, direct cloning of single B cells from human survivors, used in combination with the phage-display antibody library, could provide authentic human antibodies. Until now, it should be noted that many neutralizing antibodies have been successfully discovered for treatment of SARS-CoV [67] and MERS-CoV infection [45, 68, 69] . These antibodies have all been described favorably in the literature [29, 70, 71] . A similar approach is known as single chain fragment variable (scFv) library screening, whereby the use of RBD as a bait protein allows some neutralizing antibodies to be screened out from non-immune humans [72, 73] .Antibodies effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV infection should also have the potential for treatment of 2019-nCoV as well, as long as the binding motif in RBD shares the same sequences. The new neutralizing monoclonal antibodies would also be isolated from the patients using the established techniques.Similar to developing vaccines, drugs effective against other RNA viruses were also repurposed for CoVs. Two major types of drugs being nucleoside analogues and immunomodulators. So far, the most common therapies tried in patients with CoVs are ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN, or their combinations [74] . Despite the antiviral activity observed with in vitro studies, the clinical effect was not consistent [75] , in that ribavirin does not prolong the survival of SARS-CoV patients [74, 76] , while lopinavir/ritonavir plus ribavirin seemed to improve clinical outcomes for SARS patients [77] , but the improvement was not confirmed in MERS-CoV patients. IFNs showed effective at inducing antiviral activity against both SARS-CoV and MRES-CoV, but without significant improvement in the outcomes for the patients [78, 79] . In addition to the drug regimens used in patients, numerous drugs developed for the treatment of infection with CoVs were thoroughly discussed in the literature [57] .However, replication of an RNA virus usually generates progeny viruses with a highly diverse genome. Recombination also easily takes place between viral genomes [80] , and these gene level changes may result in drug resistance if the mutations affect the drug target domain. Development of drugs is also hampered by various evaluation methods and animal models used for testing drug activity among different labs worldwide, which could postpone selection of the best drug for clinical trials.Taken together, 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus, and like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it belongs to Betacoronavirus. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were able to spread around the globe and posed a major challenge to clinical management and a great threat to public health. Similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on the monitoring and scientific forecast, 2019-nCoV may cause a worldwide threat to public health. Over the years, research on CoVs has resulted in multiple strategies for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of CoV infection. This brief review has demonstrated that such an achievement could very well apply to 2019-nCoV, or indeed, any newly emergent CoV in the future. At present, many companies engaged in the development of biologicals have marketed nucleic acid detection kits for 2019-nCoV, such as the new coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit (double fluorescence PCR method) from Shuoshi Biotechnology. Currently, however, no diagnostic test kit is available for the detection of antibodies to 2019-nCoV.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."
0xltztfg,Clinical considerations for patients with diabetes in times of COVID-19 epidemic,"COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2), has emerged as a rapidly spreading communicable disease affecting more than 100 countries across the globe at present. The disease is primarily spread through large respiratory droplets, though the possibility of other routes of transmission cannot be ruled out, as the virus has been found in stool and urine of affected individuals [1] . The disease severity has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. There are regional variations in the mortality rates and these estimates are rapidly changing as more data are becoming available. There were 95,333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4% according to the situation report of World Health Organisation on March 5, 2020 [2] . However, a much lower mortality of 1.4% has been reported in analysis of data of 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland China [3] . Considering that the number of unreported and unconfirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the reported cases, the actual mortality may be less than 1%, which is similar to that of severe seasonal influenza [4] . India has 39confirmed cases till 10th March, 2020 and contact surveillance of these cases is going on. The understanding of epidemiological characteristics of this infection is evolving on a daily basis as the disease is spreading to different parts of the globe.Individuals with diabetes are at risk of infections, especially influenza and pneumonia. This risk can be reduced, though not completely eliminated, by good glycaemic control. All people with diabetes (above 2 years of age) are recommended pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccinations. Not only this, patients with diabetes have a severe disease when infected with respiratory viruses. Indeed, diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for Data about COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is limited at present. Diabetes was present in 42.3% of 26 fatalities due to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China [8] . In a study in 140 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, diabetes was not a risk factor for severe disease course [9] . However, another study in 150 patients (68 deaths and 82 recovered patients) in Wuhan showed that the number of co-morbidities to be a significant predictor of mortality [10] . Analysis of 11 studies regarding laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 did not mention raised blood glucose or diabetes as predictor of severe disease [11] . Notwithstanding these small series, a report of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 published by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed increased mortality in people with diabetes (2.3%, overall and 7.3%, patients with diabetes) [12] .Our knowledge about the prevalence of COVID-19 and disease course in people with diabetes will evolve as more detailed analyses are carried out. For now, it is reasonable to assume that people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing infection with SARS-CoV-2. Coexisting heart disease, kidney disease, advanced age and frailty are likely to have further increase in the severity of disease.Following measures are suggested for prevention of this disease in patients with diabetes:A. Specific Measures in Patients with Diabetes:a. It is important that people with diabetes maintain a good glycaemic control, as it might help in reducing the risk of infection and also the severity. More frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels (with use of self-monitoring blood glucose) is required. Good glycemic control may lessen chances of superadded bacterial pneumonia as well.b. Patients with diabetes and co-existing heart disease or kidney disease need special care and attempts should be made to stabilise their cardiac/renal status. c. Attention to nutrition and adequate protein intake is important. Any deficiencies of minerals and vitamins need to be taken care of. d. Exercise has been shown to improve immunity, though it might be prudent to be careful and avoid crowded places like gymnasia or swimming pools. e. It is important to take influenza and pneumonia vaccinations.The latter may decrease chances of secondary bacterial pneumonia after respiratory viral infection, however, data in present viral epidemic is not available. B. General Preventive Measures a. Thorough handwashing with soap and water should be encouraged since it kills the virus. Use of alcohol-based hand rubs is also useful. b. There is a need to practise proper respiratory hygiene with covering of mouth and nose with bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Touching of mouth, nose and eyes should be avoided. c. Contact with an affected person needs to be minimised. Use of recommended face masks is advised if there is a contact with someone with respiratory symptoms. d. Non-essential travel to major affected areas should be avoided in order to restrict the spread of infection.a. In case a person with diabetes develops fever, cough, running nose or dyspnoea, the appropriate health authority needs to be notified as testing for this disease is available at selected places only. b. The affected person needs to be isolated for 14 days or till the symptoms resolve (whichever is longer).Country-specific guidelines need to be followed. c. Majority of patients have a mild disease and can be managed at home. Hydration should be maintained and symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen, steam inhalation etc. can be given. d. Patients with type 1 diabetes should measure blood glucose and urinary ketones frequently if fever with hyperglycemia occurs. Frequent changes in dosage and correctional bolus may be required to maintain normoglycemia. e. Anti-hyperglycemic agents that can cause volume depletion or hypoglycemia should be avoided. Dosage of oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be reduced. Patients should follow sick day guidelines and may need more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and drug adjustment. f. Hospitalised patients with severe disease need frequent blood glucose monitoring. Oral agents especially metformin and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors need to be stopped. g. Insulin is the preferred agent for control of hyperglycemia in hospitalised sick patients.In the absence of a specific antiviral drug, anecdotal use of drugs like lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon-1b, RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and chloroquine has been reported. 2019-nCoV receptor binding site has a strong affinity with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and inhibitors of the rennin angiotensin system may have a role in treating severe respiratory disease [13, 14] . Zinc nanoparticles were shown to have inhibitory effects on H1N1 viral load, though their effect in COVID-19 is unknown and untested [15] . Vitamin C supplementation has some role in prevention of pneumonia and its effect on COVID-19 needs evaluation [16] . Efforts to develop a vaccine are underway, which will be a major tool to contain this epidemic [17] ."
d7n1zy0b,"Anti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19","A new emerged human coronavirus is reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1, 2] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance draft in January 2020, any traveler to Wuhan, Hubei Province in China, two weeks before the onset of the symptoms, is suspected to be a COVID-19 patient [1, 3] . Additionally, WHO distributed interim guidance for laboratories that carry out the testing for the newly emerged outbreak and infection prevention and control guidance [4, 5] . COVID-19 viral pneumonia is related to the seafood market when an unknown animal is responsible for the emergence of the outbreak [2] . Other countries started their surveillance borders to prevent the spread of the new unknown coronavirus [6] . Until one month ago, 41 cases were confirmed to be COVID-19 positives leaving one dead and seven in critical care in China. This number is grossly increasing daily, and the number of confirmed cases at the date of writing this manuscript exceeded 80,000, with > 2700 deaths [7-9[63] ]. On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China confirmed the human-to-human transmission of the Wuhan outbreak (COVID-19) [9] . The symptoms include fever, malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress [2] .COVID-19 is a member of Betacoronaviruses like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Human coronavirus (SARS HCoV) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Human coronavirus (MERS HCoV) [10, 11] . Until today, six different strains of Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported, in addition to the newly emerged COVID-19 [2, 12] . 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs belong to Alphacoronaviruses while OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 HCoVs belong to Betacoronaviruses [2, 11] . SARS and MERS HCoV are the most aggressive strains of coronaviruses, leaving about 800 deaths each. SARS HCoV has a 10% mortality rate, while MERS HCoV has a 36% mortality rate, according to the WHO [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . HCoVs generally are positive-sense and very long (30,000 bp) single-stranded RNA viruses. Two groups of protein characterize HCoVs; structural, such as Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) Matrix (M) and Envelope (E), and non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) [11] . RdRp is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. RdRp is targeted in different RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), and coronaviruses (CoVs) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The active site of RdRp is highly conserved representing two successive aspartate residues protruding from a beta-turn structure making them surface accessible through the nucleotide channel (free nucleotides can pass through) [25, 26] Several in vitro and clinical trials started in China during the last month with the first approved drug, Favilavir, by the National Medical Products Administration of China is announced yesterday (18 February 2020) in Zhejiang province. Different directly acting antiviral drugs are approved against other viruses, by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), such as Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin against RdRp of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). These drugs are nucleotides derivative competing with physiological nucleotide for RdRp active site [22, 27, 28] . Additionally, a huge number of attempts to develop anti-RdRp compounds are under clinical testing against different viruses. The half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) for Ribavirin against COVID-19 is 109.5 μM, while its half-maximum Inhibition Concentration (IC50) against Dengue virus is 8 μM [29, 30] . Sofosbuvir show 4 μM against the Zika virus [31] . Remdesivir shows EC90 of 1.76 μM against COVID-19 in vitro [30] . We focus here in the present study on nucleotide inhibitors due to its strong evidence of inhibiting emerging viral RdRps [11, 16] . We build the COVID-19 RdRp model using homology modeling after sequence comparison to the available structures in the protein data bank [32] . Molecular docking is then performed to test some direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against COVID-19 RdRp (Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Remidisvir, IDX-184). Additionally, the native nucleotides GTP and UTP, from which IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir are derived, are also tested against COVID-19 RdRp model. The results are promising and suggest possible inhibition for the currently available therapeutics against the newly emerged coronavirus.The first available full genome sequence for the newly emerged COVID-19 (NC_045512.2) is retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database [33] . Swiss Model web server is used to build a model for RdRp using its automated mode [34] . SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) is used as a template that shares identical 97.08% of the sequence with COVID-19 RdRp. 6NUR, chain A, is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved experimentally using cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) with 3.1 Å resolution deposited in the protein data bank last year [35] . The Molprobity web server of the Duke University, and the structure analysis and verification server (SAVES) of the University of California Los Angles (UCLA) are used to test the model [36, 37] . The program used to judge the validity of the model are PROCHECK [38] , Verify 3D [39] , PROVE [40] , and ERRAT [41] in addition to the Ramachandran plot of the Molprobity. After validation, the computational chemistry workspace SCIGRESS is used to minimize the model and to perform molecular docking experiments [20, 22, 42, 43] . The minimization of the model is performed using the MM3 force field after the addition of missed Hydrogen atoms [44] .Docking experiment is performed using the optimized COVID-19 and SARS (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) RdRps by the aid of AutoDock Vina software implemented in SCIGRESS [45] . Eight different compounds [11, 19, 23, [51] [52] [53] ). Ribavirin is a broad-acting antiviral drug used to treat different viruses in combination with immunomodulators or direct-acting antivirals [54] [55] [56] . Remdisivir is a nucleotide analog used to treat Ebola virus, Marburg virus, MERS and SARS infections [57] . Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone are negative control compounds that proved its inactivity against RdRp in HCV and Zika virus [26] . After docking, the structures are examined by the aid of the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) web server (Technical University of Dresden) and tabulated for comparison [58] . Fig. 1A shows the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of RNA dependent RNA polymerases from Different HCoV strains including the Alphacoronaviruses (229E and NL63) and the Betacoronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19). SARS HCoV secondary structure is shown at the top of the MSA (PDB ID: 6NUR chain: A) while its water accessibility found at the bottom of the MSA. Highly accessible residues are in blue boxes, while buried residues are represented in white at the bottom of the MSA. The black-dashed rectangle marks active site residues (successive aspartates residues D255 and D256). The active site aspartates are protruding from the beta-turn joining the β15 and β16. As implied from the MSA, the active site is highly conserved (highlighted in red). Also, the 5 Å region surrounding the D255 and D256 is highly conserved in all HCoVs, as shown by the blue-dashed rectangles. This region includes Y114, C117, N186, N190, M251, I252, L253, S254, A257, V258, E306, F307, C308, and S309. The active site residues and most of the 5 Å region surrounding it are surface accessible, though can bind to the free nucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) [23, 25] . figure) . The active site is surface accessible as we can see from the surface representation allowing the interaction with the free nucleotides passing through the nucleotide channel of the RdRp. Although some insertions found in COVID-19 RdRp, these insertions are apart from the active site aspartates and have little effect on the model quality (see the Ramachandran plot). Additionally, the homology built model is minimized using the MM3 force field to ensure its reliability before performing the docking study.For COVID-19 RdRp the percent sequence identity against SARS, MERS, OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1 HCoV strains are 90.18%, 56.76%, 55.07%, 48.79%, 48.55%, and 48.16%, respectively. Therefore, the SARS HCoV RdRp is the closest strain to the COVID-19. The complete genome for Wuhan SARS-like HCoV has a sequence identity of 89.12% and 82.34% with Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS coronavirus ZS-C, respectively. This information is important for drug designers to find a quick and potent solution against the newly emerged COVID-19 strain.COVID-19 RdRp model (801 residues) is built by the aid of the automated homology modeling, Swiss Model, web server using SARS HCoV RdRp (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) as a homolog. The model has a very high (97.08%) sequence identity to the template suggesting the high-quality model that could be obtained. The model is valid based on the values we obtain from the validation web servers. The Ramachandran plot shows 100% of the residues in the allowed regions, 97.5% in the most favored region (Fig. 1C) . Additionally, 89.9% of the residues have averaged 3D-1D score ≤ 0.2 based on the Verify 3D software, while the overall quality factor of ERRAT is 95.9%.Before performing the docking study, the structures of the small molecules (GTP, UTP, Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Cinnamaldehyde, and Thymoquinone) are prepared, ensured to be in the optimized triphosphate form. Optimization is performed using MM3 then PM6 force field after that further optimization is accomplished through B3LYP functional of Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum mechanics [44, [59] [60] [61] . The active site aspartates D255 and D256 are treated as flexible during the docking experiment. A grid box size of 30 × 30 × 30 Å centered at (x, y, z) of (142.1, 138.7, 150.0) Å is used in the docking by utilizing the AutoDock tools [62] . AutoDock Vina utilizes its scoring function (Vina) to predict the interaction between the abovementioned ligands and the RdRps' active site. Fig. 2 shows the docking score values for COVID-19 (blue columns) and SARS HCoVs (orange columns). The SARS solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) is used to dock the same ligands in order to compare its binding energy to that of COVID-19 RdRp. The grid box (30 × 30 × 30 Å) for SARS RdRp is centered at (141.2, 138.5, 149.4) Å. As reflected from the docking scores, the eight compounds, including the physiological GTP and UTP and the four drugs IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir can bind to both COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps with good binding energy (−6.5 up to −9.0 kcal/mol). Despite SARS HCoV RdRp show slightly higher binding energies (lower in binding) compared to COVID-19 RdRp, the difference is still non-significant for Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Sofosbuvir and its parent nucleotide, UTP. On average, 0.95 kcal/mol is the difference between the SARS and COVID-19 RdRps' binding energies for these compounds. On the other hand, the difference between COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps' binding energies to IDX-184 and its parent nucleotide GTP are 2.3 and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, all the tested compounds show lower (better) binding energies to COVID-19 RdRp compared to SARS RdRp. The negative control compounds Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone both show lower binding affinities to either SARS or COVID-19 (higher than −5.6 kcal/mol).In order to check the possible reason for the differences in the binding energies, we examined the interaction complexes formed after docking by the aid of the PLIP web server. Fig. 3 shows the formed interactions between the DAA drugs and COVID-19 RdRp after docking. The docking scores are listed under each complex to reflect the binding potency. Ligands are shown in orange sticks, while protein residues are in cyan stick representations labeled with its one-letter code. H-bonds are solid blue lines, while the dashed lines represent the hydrophobic interactions. Only one salt bridge (yellow spheres connected by a dashed line) is formed in the case of IDX-184 with D514, which is responsible for the increased stabilization of the formed complex, reflected on the docking score. The number of H-bonds for IDX-184, Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin are 11, 7, and 13, respectively. On the other hand, IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir both form metal interaction through the Mg +2 with D652 (two interactions) and E702, respectively. This is another reason for the increased stabilization of the formed complexes for IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir. Additionally, Sofosbuvir formed two hydrophobic interactions with Y510 and D651 of the COVID-19 RdRp.To summarize the abovementioned data, we can say that IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin can tightly bind to the newly emerged coronavirus RdRp and hence contradict the function of the protein leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 show more promising results then comes Sofosbuvir as a potent inhibitor against the newly emerged COVID-19 strain of HCoV. Further optimization of these two compounds can result in a more potent compound able to stop the newly emerged infection.The newly emerged coronavirus in Wuhan city in China has a health concern since the last outbreak of these types of viruses (SARS) in the year 2002-2003 in the same country leaving > 700 deaths and 8000 cases in hospitals. Besides, another outbreak in the Middle East region has an entirely different infection pattern (MERS) leaving > 800 deaths and 2500 hospitalizations. The present study aimed to test and suggest possible inhibitors, DAA drugs, currently in the market stop the infection immediately. Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remdisivir can be used against the new strain of coronavirus that emerged with promising results. GTP derivatives may be used as specific inhibitors against COVID-19.The docking structures are available upon request from the corresponding author. The author declares that there is no competing interest in this work."
2hgwa6pq,A potential role for integrins in host cell entry by SARS-CoV-2,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (nCoV) of animal origin started infecting humans, initiating a severe outbreak in China. This virus, named ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), can cause a severe and even fatal respiratory disease, called Coronavirus disease-19 , and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus is highly contagious and transmission occurs presumably via airborne droplets, and fecal-oral route . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the large family of Coronaviridae (""BetacoronavirusṼ iralZone,"" n.d.). This genus comprises mainly vertebrate respiratory viruses, including HCoV-OC43, which is responsible for 10% of common colds (McIntosh et al., 1970) , and SARS, the cause of an epidemic in 2003 with over 8000 infected individuals in 30 countries (Guan et al., 2004) . The SARS-CoV-2 genome has now been sequenced: its close similarity to SARS suggests that it has emerged from the same reservoir, namely bats .The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is the main molecule present at the surface of the virion. This large glycoprotein assembles in trimers that form a crown-like structure on the envelope which gives this virus family its name (corona = crown) (Fig. 1) . The spike protein is a multifunctional protein that contributes to host receptor binding, cell tropism and pathogenesis. It acts by binding host receptors on target cells, inducing endocytosis of virion particle, and then catalyzes the fusion between host and viral membranes, allowing penetration of the virus genome into host cytoplasm. It is also the major target for the host immune system, adding selective pressure to this complex machinery. The angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is a known cell receptor for SARS in human and bats, and is also used by SARS-CoV-2 . We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may also use integrins as cell receptors in one or more host species, binding to them through a conserved RGD (403-405: Arg-Gly-Asp) motif that is present in the receptor-binding domain of the spike proteins of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed to date (Fig. 2) . The motif was identified by a PROSITE scan that included motifs with a high probability of occurrence (PDOC00016) (Sigrist et al., 2013) . It is absent from all other coronavirus spike proteins (n = 30) and from all SARS sequences tested (n = 155). The RGD motif is the minimal peptide sequence required for binding proteins of the integrin family, which are commonly used as receptors by many human viruses (Hussein et al., 2015) . RGD motif integrin-binding is essential for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (Chang et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2014) , human Adenovirus type 2/5 (Wickham et al., 1994) , human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5) (Feire et al., 2004) , Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (HHV-8) (Hussein et al., 2015) , Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4) (Xiao et al., 2008, p. 2), Rotavirus (RV) (Zárate et al., 2004) , and Coxsackievirus A9 (Williams et al., 2004) . The conservation of the motif and its localization in the receptor-binding region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggests that integrins may be alternative receptors for this virus. This could broaden cell tropism and potentially affect viral pathogenicity and transmission.In order to bind integrin, the motif must be present at the surface of the protein. To assess the localization of the RGD motif in the spike protein, we have analyzed its 3D model from SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018) . This model was derived from homology modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein sequence from UniProt (P0DTC2; SPIKE_WCPV) with the SARS spike glycoprotein 3D structure (PDB 6ACD) as template (Berman et al., 2000) . The RGD motif and other known binding regions were visualized with Jmol, an open-source Java viewer for chemical structures in 3D (http://www.jmol.org/).The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RGD lies in the receptorbinding domain (amino acids 319 to 541) (Fig. 2) at the border of the subdomain (amino acids 437 to 508) that is specifically involved in the binding to human ACE2 (Li et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2003) . In the unbound state, i.e. the ""down"" or mushroom-like conformation, the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RGD motif defines a small loop (restricted to the motif) between two secondary structures, a β-strand and a α-helix, near the surface of the spike protein ( Fig. 3a and b) . Structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bound to ACE2 receptor motif have been recently made available (Lan et al., 2020, p. 2; Yan et al., 2020) . ACE2 binding induces dramatic conformational changes involving one of the receptorbinding domains of the trimer. This adopts a protruding ""up"" conformation, exposing the ACE2 binding subdomain, as well as the region containing RGD (Fig. 3c and d) . However, it is difficult to predict from ACE2 binding how an integrin-binding would look like. It could induce a different conformational change of the receptor-binding domain, exposing the RGD motif to integrin binding.Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that play roles in cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell signaling processes (Hynes, 2002) . Viral proteins with RGD motifs promote infection by binding integrin heterodimers such as αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ5, αVβ6, αVβ8, α5β1, α8β1 and αIIbβ3 (Hussein et al., 2015) , activating transducing pathways involving phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) or mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK), which promote virus entry and infection of the host cell. Adenoviruses of serotypes 2 and 5 possess such proteins, Fig. 2 . Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein with a focus on the receptor-binding domain. The sequences of 12 betacoronavirus were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2019) . The receptor-binding domain and the ACE2 receptor-binding region are colored in blue and light blue, respectively. The RGD motif of SARS-CoV-2 is highlighted in color. Numbers refer to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence.A) The mushroom-like fold of the model is the classical one in absence of ligand binding. Ligand binding causes a drastic conformational change leading to the protrusion of one of the trimeric binding domains, further exposing the RGD-loop. The receptor-binding domain has been colored in blue, with a focus in light blue on the part binding the receptor ACE2. The RGD motif is colored in red. B) Enlarged view of the receptor-binding domain. The region demonstrated to bind ACE2, as well as the RGD-loops, are located at the surface of the domain even in the absence of ligand. Same colors as in A. C) and D) Model of SARS-CoV-2 structure in the conformational state of ACE2binding provided by SWISSMODEL and visualized with Jmol. C) The receptor-binding domain of the trimer is in the ""up"" conformation exposing the RGD motif. Same color as in Fig. 2; ACE2 is not represented. D) Close-up view of the receptor-binding domain, highlighting the location of the RGD motif at the very surface of the domain. Same colors as in A. as does human metapneumovirus (Chang et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2014) . This virus is the closest to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of organ tropism and symptoms, although it mainly affects children. Interestingly, the metapneumovirus protein F's RGD motif adopts a fold similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, with a small loop inserted between two secondary structures (in this case two β-sheets) (Cox et al., 2012) . Given these apparent similarities, it is plausible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired integrin-binding to promote virus entry into host cells, but experimental proof of this is required. Binding to integrin may play a supplemental role to ACE2 binding, like facilitating endocytosis by signaling through the integrin. Alternatively, the virus could infect different target cells by binding to ACE2 or to integrins.There are currently few antiviral molecules that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 Agents that block integrin binding may provide a promising avenue of research. Known blockers of integrin binding include the antibody natalizumab (a α4β1/β7 integrin antagonist) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis/Crohn's disease, the small molecule tirofiban (an αIIbβ3 inhibitor) for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome, as well as inhibitors of αV RGD-binding integrin (Hatley et al., 2018) . Anti-integrin pharmacotherapy is certainly possible, although no treatment is yet available that prevents virus-integrin binding, suggesting that further research is necessary to neutralize these pathogens.Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (nCoV) of animal origin started infecting humans, initiating a severe outbreak in China. This virus, named ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), can cause a severe and even fatal respiratory disease, called Coronavirus disease-19 , and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus is highly contagious and transmission occurs presumably via airborne droplets, and fecal-oral route . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the large family of Coronaviridae (""BetacoronavirusṼ iralZone,"" n.d.). This genus comprises mainly vertebrate respiratory viruses, including HCoV-OC43, which is responsible for 10% of common colds (McIntosh et al., 1970) , and SARS, the cause of an epidemic in 2003 with over 8000 infected individuals in 30 countries (Guan et al., 2004) . The SARS-CoV-2 genome has now been sequenced: its close similarity to SARS suggests that it has emerged from the same reservoir, namely bats .The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is the main molecule present at the surface of the virion. This large glycoprotein assembles in trimers that form a crown-like structure on the envelope which gives this virus family its name (corona = crown) (Fig. 1) . The spike protein is a multifunctional protein that contributes to host receptor binding, cell tropism and pathogenesis. It acts by binding host receptors on target cells, inducing endocytosis of virion particle, and then catalyzes the fusion between host and viral membranes, allowing penetration of the virus genome into host cytoplasm. It is also the major target for the host immune system, adding selective pressure to this complex machinery. The angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is a known cell receptor for SARS in human and bats, and is also used by SARS-CoV-2 . We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may also use integrins as cell receptors in one or more host species, binding to them through a conserved RGD (403-405: Arg-Gly-Asp) motif that is present in the receptor-binding domain of the spike proteins of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed to date (Fig. 2) . The motif was identified by a PROSITE scan that included motifs with a high probability of occurrence (PDOC00016) (Sigrist et al., 2013) . It is absent from all other coronavirus spike proteins (n = 30) and from all SARS sequences tested (n = 155). The RGD motif is the minimal peptide sequence required for binding proteins of the integrin family, which are commonly used as receptors by many human viruses (Hussein et al., 2015) . RGD motif integrin-binding is essential for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (Chang et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2014) , human Adenovirus type 2/5 (Wickham et al., 1994) , human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5) (Feire et al., 2004) , Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (HHV-8) (Hussein et al., 2015) , Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4) (Xiao et al., 2008, p. 2), Rotavirus (RV) (Zárate et al., 2004) , and Coxsackievirus A9 (Williams et al., 2004) .

r22x7gnu,Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro,"to be 100% effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC 50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 μM, 4 suggesting further in vivo studies are recommended to evaluate this antiviral nucleoside. Nafamostat, a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV, which prevents membrane fusion, was inhibitive against the 2019-nCoV infection (EC 50 = 22.50 μM, CC 50 > 100 μM, SI > 4.44). Nitazoxanide, a commercial antiprotozoal agent with an antiviral potential against a broad range of viruses including human and animal coronaviruses, inhibited the 2019-nCoV at a low-micromolar concentration (EC 50 = 2.12 μM; CC 50 > 35.53 μM; SI > 16.76). Further in vivo evaluation of this drug against 2019-nCoV infection is recommended. Notably, two compounds remdesivir (EC 50 = 0.77 μM; CC 50 > 100 μM; SI > 129.87) and chloroquine (EC 50 = 1.13 μM; CC 50 > 100 μM, SI > 88.50) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high SI (Fig. 1a, b) .Remdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV 5 ) infection in cultured cells, mice and nonhuman primate (NHP) models. It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. 6 Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination. 7 Our time-ofaddition assay showed remdesivir functioned at a stage post virus entry (Fig. 1c, d) , which is in agreement with its putative antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue. Warren et al. showed that in NHP model, intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir resulted in concomitant persistent levels of its active form in the blood (10 μM) and conferred 100% protection against Ebola virus infection. 7 Our data showed that EC 90 value of remdesivir against 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.76 μM, suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in NHP. Our preliminary data (Supplementary information, Fig. S2 ) showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV. 2 Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broadspectrum antiviral drug. 8, 9 Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/ cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV. 10 Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at postentry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1c, d) . Besides its antiviral activity, chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration. The EC 90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV in Vero Cytotoxicity of these drugs to Vero E6 cells was measured by CCK-8 assays. The left and right Y-axis of the graphs represent mean % inhibition of virus yield and cytotoxicity of the drugs, respectively. The experiments were done in triplicates. b Immunofluorescence microscopy of virus infection upon treatment of remdesivir and chloroquine. Virus infection and drug treatment were performed as mentioned above. At 48 h p.i., the infected cells were fixed, and then probed with rabbit sera against the NP of a bat SARS-related CoV 2 as the primary antibody and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Abcam) as the secondary antibody, respectively. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Bars, 100 μm. c and d Time-of-addition experiment of remdesivir and chloroquine. For ""Full-time"" treatment, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with the drugs for 1 h, and virus was then added to allow attachment for 2 h. Afterwards, the virus-drug mixture was removed, and the cells were cultured with drug-containing medium until the end of the experiment. For ""Entry"" treatment, the drugs were added to the cells for 1 h before viral attachment, and at 2 h p.i., the virus-drug mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium and maintained till the end of the experiment. For ""Post-entry"" experiment, drugs were added at 2 h p.i., and maintained until the end of the experiment. For all the experimental groups, cells were infected with 2019-nCoV at an MOI of 0.05, and virus yield in the infected cell supernatants was quantified by qRT-PCR c and NP expression in infected cells was analyzed by Western blot d at 14 h p.i. E6 cells was 6.90 μM, which can be clinically achievable as demonstrated in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg administration. 11 Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.Our findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. Since these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments, we suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease.to be 100% effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC 50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 μM, 4 suggesting further in vivo studies are recommended to evaluate this antiviral nucleoside.

vbayngh0,SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor,"The emerging SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens public health. Hoffmann and coworkers show that SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the host cell factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor. These findings might help to establish options for prevention and treatment.Several members of the family Coronaviridae constantly circulate in the human population and usually cause mild respiratory disease (Corman et al., 2019) . In contrast, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are transmitted from animals to humans and cause severe respiratory diseases in afflicted individuals, SARS and MERS, respectively (Fehr et al., 2017) . SARS emerged in 2002 in Guangdong province, China, and its subsequent global spread was associated with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths (de Wit et al., 2016; WHO, 2004) . Chinese horseshoe bats serve as natural reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005a) . Human transmission was facilitated by intermediate hosts like civet cats and raccoon dogs, which are frequently sold as food sources in Chinese wet markets (Guan et al., 2003) . At present, no specific antivirals or approved vaccines are available to combat SARS, and the SARS pandemic in 2002 and 2003 was finally stopped by conventional control measures, including travel restrictions and patient isolation.In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred (Chan et al., 2020) and the disease, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease . On February 12, 2020, a total of 44,730 laboratoryconfirmed infections were reported in China, including 8,204 severe cases and 1,114 deaths (WHO, 2020) . Infections were also detected in 24 countries outside China and were associated with international travel. At present, it is unknown whether the sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV translate into similar biological properties, including pandemic potential (Munster et al., 2020) .The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the surface unit, S1, of the S protein to a cellular receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells. In addition, entry requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, which entails S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2' site and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes, a process driven by the S2 subunit (Figure 1A) . SARS-S engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (Glowacka et al., 2011; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011) . The SARS-S/ACE2 interface has been elucidated at the atomic level, and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a key determinant of SARS-CoV transmissibility (Li et al., 2005a (Li et al., , 2005b . SARS-S und SARS-2-S share $76% amino acid identity. However, it is unknown whether SARS-2-S like SARS-S employs ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for host cell entry.Evidence for Efficient Proteolytic Processing of SARS-2-S The goal of our study was to obtain insights into how SARS-2-S facilitates viral entry into target cells and how this process can be proteolytic cleavage sites (S1/S2, S2 0 ). Amino acid sequences around the two protease recognition sites (red) are indicated for SARS-S and SARS-2-S (asterisks indicate conserved residues). Arrow heads indicate the cleavage site. (B) Analysis of SARS-2-S expression (upper panel) and pseudotype incorporation (lower panel) by western blot using an antibody directed against the C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag added to the viral S proteins analyzed. Shown are representative blots from three experiments. b-Actin (cell lysates) and VSV-M (particles) served as loading controls (M, matrix protein). Black arrow heads indicate bands corresponding to uncleaved S proteins (S0) whereas gray arrow heads indicate bands corresponding to the S2 subunit. (C) Cell lines of human and animal origin were inoculated with pseudotyped VSV harboring VSV-G, SARS-S, or SARS-2-S. At 16 h postinoculation, pseudotype entry was analyzed by determining luciferase activity in cell lysates. Signals obtained for particles bearing no envelope protein were used for normalization. The average of three independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. Unprocessed data from a single experiment are presented in Figure S1 . blocked. For this, we first asked whether SARS-2-S is robustly expressed in a human cell line, 293T, commonly used for experimentation because of its high transfectability. Moreover, we analyzed whether there is evidence for proteolytic processing of the S protein because certain coronavirus S proteins are cleaved by host cell proteases at the S1/S2 cleavage site in infected cells ( Figure 1A ). Immunoblot analysis of 293T cells expressing SARS-2-S protein with a C-terminal antigenic tag revealed a band with a molecular weight expected for unprocessed S protein (S0) ( Figure 1B) . A band with a size expected for the S2 subunit of the S protein was also observed in cells and, more prominently, in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing SARS-2-S ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, an S2 signal was largely absent in cells and particles expressing SARS-S ( Figure 1B ), as previously documented (Glowacka et al., 2011; Hofmann et al., 2004b) . These results suggest efficient proteolytic processing of SARS-2-S in human cells, in keeping with the presence of several arginine residues at the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-2-S but not SARS-S ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, the S2 0 cleavage site of SARS-2-S was similar to that of SARS-S.Replication-defective VSV particles bearing coronavirus S proteins faithfully reflect key aspects of coronavirus host cell entry (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019) . We employed VSV pseudotypes bearing SARS-2-S to study cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Both SARS-2-S and SARS-S were robustly incorporated into VSV particles ( Figure 1B) , allowing a meaningful side-by-side comparison; although, formally, comparable particle incorporation of the S1 subunit remains to be demonstrated. We first asked which cell lines were susceptible to SARS-2-S-driven entry, using a panel of well-characterized cell lines of human and animal origin, respectively. All cell lines were readily susceptible to entry driven by the glycoprotein of the pantropic VSV (VSV-G) (Figure 1C;  Figure S1 ), as expected. Most human cell lines and the animal cell lines Vero and MDCKII were also susceptible to entry driven by SARS-S ( Figure 1C ). Moreover, SARS-2-S facilitated entry into an identical spectrum of cell lines as SARS-S (Figure 1C) , suggesting similarities in choice of entry receptors.In order to elucidate why SARS-S and SARS-2-S mediated entry into the same cell lines, we next determined whether SARS-2-S harbors amino acid residues required for interaction with the SARS-S entry receptor ACE2. Sequence analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoV-related viruses from bats (SARSr-CoV), of which some but not all can use ACE2 for host cell entry (Figure 2A ; Figure S2 ). Analysis of the receptor binding motif (RBM), a portion of the receptor binding domain (RBD) that makes contact with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a) , revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ACE2 binding by SARS-S were conserved in SARS-2-S ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, most of these residues were absent from S proteins of SARSr-CoV previously found not to use ACE2 for entry ( Figure 2B ) (Ge et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2013; Menachery et al., 2020) . In agreement with these findings, directed expression of human and bat (Rhinolophus alcyone) ACE2 but not human DPP4, the entry receptor used by MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013) , or human APN, the entry receptor used by HCoV-229E (Yeager et al., 1992) , allowed SARS-2-S-and SARS-S-driven entry into otherwise non-susceptible BHK-21 cells ( Figure 3A ). Moreover, antiserum raised against human ACE2 blocked SARS-S-and SARS-2-S-but not VSV-G-or MERS-S-driven entry ( Figure 3B ). Finally, authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected BHK-21 cells transfected to express ACE2 cells but not parental BHK-21 cells with high efficiency ( Figure 3C ), indicating that SARS-2-S, like SARS-S, uses ACE2 for cellular entry.The Cellular Serine Protease TMPRSS2 Primes SARS-2-S for Entry, and a Serine Protease Inhibitor Blocks SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Lung Cells We next investigated protease dependence of SARS-CoV-2 entry. SARS-CoV can use the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) (Simmons et al., 2005) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 (Glowacka et al., 2011; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011) for S protein priming in cell lines, and inhibition of both proteases is required for robust blockade of viral entry (Kawase et al., 2012) . However, only TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host whereas CatB/L activity is dispensable (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Shirato et al., 2016; Shirato et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2015) .In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can use CatB/L for cell entry, we initially employed ammonium chloride, which elevates endosomal pH and thereby blocks CatB/L activity. 293T cells (TMPRSS2 À , transfected to express ACE2 for robust S protein-driven entry) and Caco-2 cells (TMPRSS2 + ) were used as targets. Ammonium chloride blocked VSV-G-dependent entry into both cell lines whereas entry driven by Nipah virus F and G proteins was not affected ( Figure S3A ; data not shown), consistent with Nipah virus but not VSV being able to fuse directly with the plasma membrane (Bossart et al., 2002) . Ammonium chloride treatment strongly inhibited SARS-2-S-and SARS-S-driven entry into TMPRSS2 À 293T cells ( Figure S3 A), suggesting CatB/L dependence. Inhibition of entry into TMPRSS2 + Caco-2 cells was less efficient compared to 293T cells ( Figure S3 A), which would be compatible with SARS-2-S priming by TMPRSS2 in Caco-2 cells. Indeed, the clinically proven serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which is active against TMPRSS2 (Kawase et al., 2012), partially blocked SARS-2-S-driven entry into Caco-2 (Figure S3 B) and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells ( Figure 4A ). Full inhibition was attained when camostat mesylate and E-64d, an inhibitor of CatB/L, were added ( Figure 4A ; Figure S3B ), indicating that SARS-2-S can use both CatB/L as well as TMPRSS2 for priming in these cell lines. In contrast, camostat mesylate did not interfere with SARS-2-S-driven entry into the TMPRSS2 À cell lines 293T ( Figure S3B ) and Vero ( Figure 4A ), which was efficiently blocked by E-64d and therefore is CatB/L dependent. Moreover, directed expression of TMPRSS2 rescued SARS-2-S-driven entry from inhibition by E-64d ( Figure 4B ), confirming that SARS-2-S can employ TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.We next analyzed whether TMPRSS2 usage is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells. Indeed, camostat mesylate significantly reduced MERS-S-, SARS-S-, and SARS-2-S-but not VSV-G-driven entry into the lung cell line Calu-3 ( Figure 4C ) and exerted no unwanted cytotoxic effects (Figure S3 C). Similarly, camostat mesylate treatment significantly reduced Calu-3 infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4D ). Finally, camostat mesylate treatment inhibited SARS-S-and SARS-2-S-but not VSV-G-driven entry into primary human lung cells ( Figure 4E ). Figure S2 for more details). (B) Alignment of the receptor binding motif of SARS-S with corresponding sequences of bat-associated betacoronavirus S proteins, which are able or unable to use ACE2 as cellular receptor, reveals that SARS-CoV-2 possesses crucial amino acid residues for ACE2 binding.Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells.Evidence that Antibodies Raised against SARS-CoV Will Cross-Neutralize SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibody response directed against the viral S protein (Liu et al., 2006) . We investigated whether such antibodies block SARS-2-Sdriven entry. Four sera obtained from three convalescent SARS patients inhibited SARS-S-but not VSV-G-driven entry in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5 ). In addition, these sera also reduced SARS-2-S-driven entry, although with lower efficiency compared to SARS-S ( Figure 5) . Similarly, rabbit sera raised against the S1 subunit of SARS-S reduced both SARS-S-and SARS-2-S-driven entry with high efficiency, and again inhibition of SARS-S-driven entry was more efficient. Thus, antibody responses raised against SARS-S during infection or vaccination might offer some level of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.The present study provides evidence that host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming. Moreover, it suggests that antibody responses raised against SARS-CoV could at least partially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results have important implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenesis and reveal a target for therapeutic intervention.The finding that SARS-2-S exploits ACE2 for entry, which was also reported by Zhou and colleagues (Zhou et al., 2020) while the present manuscript was in revision, suggests that the virus might target a similar spectrum of cells as SARS-CoV. In the lung, SARS-CoV infects mainly pneumocytes and macrophages (Shieh et al., 2005) . However, ACE2 expression is not limited to the lung, and extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV in ACE2 + tissues was observed (Ding et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2005; Hamming et al., 2004) . The same can be expected for SARS-CoV-2, although affinity of SARS-S and SARS-2-S for ACE2 remains to be compared. It has been suggested that the modest ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory tract (Bertram et al., 2012; Hamming et al., 2004) might limit SARS-CoV transmissibility. In light of the potentially increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV, one may speculate that the new virus might exploit cellular attachment-promoting factors with higher efficiency than SARS-CoV to ensure robust infection of ACE2 + cells in the upper respiratory tract. This could comprise binding to cellular glycans, a function ascribed to the S1 domain of certain coronaviruses (Li et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019) . Finally, it should be noted that ACE2 expression protects from lung injury and is downregulated by SARS-S (Haga et al., 2008; Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005) , which might promote SARS. It will thus be interesting to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 also interferes with ACE2 expression.Priming of coronavirus S proteins by host cell proteases is essential for viral entry into cells and encompasses S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2 0 sites. The S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-2-S harbors several arginine residues (multibasic), which indicates high cleavability. Indeed, SARS-2-S was efficiently cleaved in cells, and cleaved S protein was incorporated into VSV particles. Notably, the cleavage site sequence can determine the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses (Menachery et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2014 Yang et al., , 2015 , and a multibasic cleavage site was not present in RaTG13, the coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. It will thus be interesting to determine whether the presence of a multibasic cleavage site is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells and how this cleavage site was acquired.The S proteins of SARS-CoV can use the endosomal cysteine proteases CatB/L for S protein priming in TMPRSS2 À cells (Simmons et al., 2005) . However, S protein priming by TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L is essential for viral entry into primary target cells and for viral spread in the infected host (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Kawase et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015) . The present study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 spread also depends on TMPRSS2 activity, although we note that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells was inhibited but not abrogated by camostat mesylate, likely reflecting residual S protein priming by CatB/L. One can speculate that furin-mediated precleavage at the S1/S2 site in infected cells might promote subsequent TMPRSS2-dependent entry into target cells, as reported for MERS-CoV (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018; Park et al., 2016) . Collectively, our present findings and previous work highlight TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor that is critical for spread of several clinically relevant viruses, including influenza A viruses and coronaviruses (Gierer et al., 2013; Glowacka et al., 2011; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Kawase et al., 2012; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2015) . In contrast, TMPRSS2 is dispensable for development and homeostasis (Kim et al., 2006) and thus constitutes an attractive drug target. In this context, it is noteworthy that the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which blocks TMPRSS2 activity (Kawase et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015) , has been approved in Japan for human use, but for an unrelated indication. This compound or related ones with potentially increased antiviral activity (Yamamoto et al., 2016) could thus be considered for off-label treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibody response that can be detected even 24 months after infection (Liu et al., 2006) and that is largely directed against the S protein.Moreover, experimental SARS vaccines, including recombinant S protein (He et al., 2006) and inactivated virus (Lin et al., 2007) , induce neutralizing antibody responses. Although confirmation with infectious virus is pending, our results indicate that neutralizing antibody responses raised against SARS-S could offer some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have implications for outbreak control.In sum, this study provided key insights into the first step of SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral entry into cells, and defined potential targets for antiviral intervention.Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: We thank Heike Hofmann-Winkler for discussion, Andrea Maisner for Nipah F and G expression plasmids, Anette Teichmann for technical assistance, and Roberto Cattaneo for plasmid pCG1.

The average of three independent experiments performed with triplicate samples is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. Statistical significance was tested by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett posttest. dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) and human TMPRSS2 have been described elsewhere (Bertram et al., 2010; Brinkmann et al., 2017; Gierer et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2013; Hofmann et al., 2005; Kleine-Weber et al., 2019) . For generation of the expression plasmids for SARS-2-S with or without a C-terminal HA epitope tag we PCR-amplified the coding sequence of a synthetic, codon-optimized (for human cells) SARS-2-S DNA (GeneArt Gene Synthesis, ThermoFisher Scientific) based on the publicly available protein sequence in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBI Reference Sequence: YP_009724390.1) and cloned in into the pCG1 expression vector via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites.For pseudotyping, VSV pseudotypes were generated according to a published protocol (Berger Rentsch and Zimmer, 2011) . In brief, 293T transfected to express the viral surface glycoprotein under study were inoculated with a replication-deficient VSV vector that contains expression cassettes for eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and firefly luciferase instead of the VSV-G open reading frame, VSV*DG-fLuc (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer, Institute of Virology and Immunology, Mittelhä usern/Switzerland). After an incubation period of 1 h at 37 C, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed with PBS before medium supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC) was added in order to neutralize residual input virus (no antibody was added to cells expressing VSV-G). Pseudotyped particles were harvested 16 h postinoculation, clarified from cellular debris by centrifugation and used for experimentation.For transduction, target cells were grown in 96-well plates until they reached 50%-75% confluency before they were inoculated with respective pseudotyped VSV. For experiments addressing receptor usage, cells were transfected with expression plasmids 24 h before transduction. In order to block ACE2 on the cell surface, cells were pretreated with 2 or 20 mg/mL anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems, goat, AF933). As control, an unrelated anti-DC-SIGN antibody (Serotec, goat, 20 mg/mL) was used. For experiments involving ammonium chloride (final concentration 50 mM) and protease inhibitors (E-64d, 25 mM; camostat mesylate, 1-500 mM), target cells were treated with the respective chemical 2 h before transduction. For neutralization experiments, pseudotypes were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 C with different serum dilutions. Transduction efficiency was quantified 16 h posttransduction by measuring the activity of firefly luciferase in cell lysates using a commercial substrate (Beetle-Juice, PJK) and a Hidex Sense plate luminometer (Hidex).Cell viability following treatment of Calu-3 cells with camostat mesylate was analyzed using the CellTiter-Gloâ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). In brief, Calu-3 cells grown to 50% confluency in 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of different concentrations (1-500 mM) of camostat mesylate. Next, the culture medium was aspirated and 100 ml of fresh culture medium was added before an identical volume of the assay substrate was added. Wells containing only culture medium served as a control to determine the assay background. After 2 min of incubation on a rocking platform and additional 10 min without movement, samples were transferred into white opaque-walled 96-well plates and luminescent signal were recorded using a Hidex Sense plate luminometer (Hidex).To analyze S protein expression in cells, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged SARS-2-S or SARS-S or empty expression vector (negative control). The culture medium was replaced at 16 h posttransfection and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Then, the culture medium was removed and cells were washed once with PBS before 2x SDS-sample buffer (0.03 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the samples were heated for 15 min at 96 C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.For analysis of S protein incorporation into pseudotyped particles, 1 mL of the respective VSV pseudotypes were loaded onto a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion (volume 50 ml) and subjected to high-speed centrifugation (25.000 g for 120 min at 4 C). Thereafter, 1 mL of supernatant was removed and the residual volume was mixed with 50 ml of 2x SDS-sample buffer, heated for 15 min at 96 C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. After protein transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk solution (5% skim milk dissolved in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated over night at 4 C with the primary antibody (diluted in in skim milk solution)). Following three washing intervals of 10 min in PBS-T the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (diluted in in skim milk solution), before the membranes were washed and imaged using an in in house-prepared enhanced chemiluminescent solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.6], 250 mg/mL luminol, 1 mg/mL para-hydroxycoumaric acid, 0.3% H 2 O 2 ) and the ChemoCam imaging system along with the ChemoStar Professional software (Intas Science Imaging Instruments GmbH). The following primary antibodies were used: Mouse anti-HA tag (Sigma-Aldrich, H3663, 1:2,500), mouse anti-b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A5441, 1:2,000), mouse anti-VSV matrix protein (Kerafast, EB0011, 1:2,500). As secondary antibody we used a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, 115-035-003, 1:10000).Infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2 BHK-21 cells (1.6 x10 5 cells/mL) were transfected with ACE2 and DsRed as a negative control. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and infected with 8x10 7 genome equivalents (GE) per 24-well of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Munich 929 for 1 h at 37 C. Calu-3 cells (5 x10 5 cells/mL) were mock treated or treated with 100 mM camostat mesylate (Sigma Aldrich) 2 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolate Munich 929 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 for 1 h at 37 C. After infection, cells were washed three times with PBS before 500 ml of DMEM medium was added. At 16 or 24 h post infection, 50 ml culture supernatant was subjected to viral RNA extraction using a viral RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GE per ml were detected by real time RT-PCR using a previously reported protocol (Corman et al., 2020) .The convalescent human anti-SARS-CoV sera (CSS-2 to CSS-5) stemmed from the serum collection of the national consiliary laboratory for coronavirus diagnostics at Charité , Berlin, Germany or the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany. All sera were previously tested positive using a recombinant S-based immunofluorescence test (Buchholz et al., 2013) . CSS-2 was taken from a SARS patient 3.5 years post onset of disease. CSS-3 and CSS-4 originated from a second SARS patient 24 and 36 days post onset of disease. CSS-5 was collected from a third SARS patient 10 days post onset of disease. Rabbit sera were obtained by immunizing rabbits with purified SARS-S1 protein fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin.Phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining tree, bootstrap method with 5,000 iterations, Poisson substitution model, uniform rates among sites, complete deletion of gaps/missing data) was performed using the MEGA7.0.26 software. Reference sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) databases. Reference numbers are indicated in the figures.One-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett posttest was used to test for statistical significance. Only p values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant (p > 0.05 [ns, not significant], p % 0.05 [*], p % 0.01 [**], p % 0.001 [***]). For all statistical analyses, the GraphPad Prism 7 software package was used (GraphPad Software).The study did not generate unique datasets or code.Cell 181, 1-10.e1-e5, April 16, 2020 e5 Figure S1 . Representative Experiment Included in the Average, Related to Figure 1C The indicated cells lines were inoculated with pseudoparticles harboring the indicated viral glycoprotein or harboring no glycoprotein (no protein) and luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined at 16 h posttransduction.

After the solution was clear (about 5 minutes), supernatant was carefully removed and discarded. A washing step (2 times) was performed by adding 200 μl of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube while in the magnetic rack and incubated at room temperature for 30 seconds, supernatant was then carefully removed and discarded. The beads were air dried for 5 minutes while the tube was on the magnetic rack with the lid open. Once dried, DNA target from the beads was eluted with 23 μl 0.1X TE. Tube was mixed on a vortex mixer or by pipetting up and down, quickly spun and incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature, and placed on magnetic rack. Without disturbing the bead pellet, 20 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a clean PCR tube. Libraries could be stored at -20 °C if not used immediately. Using the protocol described above we have sequenced 100% of the virus from the patients and made available on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) [1, 2] under accessions EPI_ISL_403962 and EPI_ISL_403963. In assembling the read data from the sputum specimen to the Wuhan Bat CoV virus reference sequence, the coverage and read depth was similar to that from the upper respiratory specimen. To obtain a complete consensus of the virus, the sequencing reads from the sputum and nasopharyngeal specimens from this patient were pooled. Consensus sequences were generated from threshold coverage values of 2 and 4.Phylogenetic tree of Wuhan CoV full genome sequences in context of representatives of all CoV families (alignment with MAFFT [3] whole genome Neighbor Joining, Maximum Composite Likelihood, uniform rates, 500 bootstrap, using MEGA X [4] ). Figure 2 : The number of base differences per sequence from between sequences are shown. This analysis involved 23 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 29904 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [4] .Structural mapping of mutations in the spike glycoprotein between SARS and the current SARS-CoV-2 was done using MAFFT [3] for sequence alignment and a custom Perl script to map differences to the known crystal structure of SARS spike glycoprotein (PDB:6ACG [5] ) using YASARA [6] .We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in travellers from Wuhan, China to Thailand. Both were independent introductions on separate flights, discovered with thermoscanners and confirmed with RT-PCR and genome sequencing. Both cases do not seem directly linked to the Huanan Seafood Market in Hubei but the viral genomes are identical to four other sequences from Wuhan, suggesting early spread within the city already in the first week of January.In late December 2019, an outbreak with an initially undiagnosed pneumonia was reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and linked to the Huanan Seafood Market [1, 2] . The causative pathogen was identified as a novel betacoronavirus within the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) family, recently termed SARS-CoV-2 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In response to the outbreak, several countries including Thailand, established thermal screening at the airport for travellers from Wuhan since 3 January. On 8 January and 13 January, suspected cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 were identified at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport. We report the investigation, basic clinical characteristics and viral genomes derived from these cases.A woman in her early 60s from Wuhan developed a fever with chills, sore throat and headache on 5 January 2020. She went to a local health facility in China and received undisclosed medication. On 8 January 2020, she took a direct ca 4 h flight to Thailand from Wuhan, with five family members, as part of a tour group of 16 (including the case). Her measured temperature at the arrival gate was 38.6 °C by thermoscanner, and confirmed with a tympanic thermometer. After being interviewed by quarantine officers, she was transferred to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute (BIDI) Hospital, Nonthaburi, for isolation and laboratory investigations. She reported a runny nose and sore throat but no dyspnea or diarrhoea. Upon admission, her vital signs were normal except for elevated blood pressure. Her physical examination was unremarkable including inconspicuous lung sounds. Her complete blood count suggested a viral infection from relatively decreased neutrophil (48%; norm: 35-75%) to lymphocyte (40%; norm: 20-59%) ratio [8] . The chest X-ray (CXR) results on 8 January were compatible with pneumonia with mild thickening lung marking at both lower lungs possibly because of crowded lung rather than infiltration. It also showed borderline cardiomegaly. Repeat CXR after 7 days showed no remarkable changes.In the interview, the patient explicitly stated that she had not visited the Huanan Seafood Market but she was living near another local market, which she visited daily until illness onset. This market was at ca 7.5 km distance from the Huanan Seafood Market. The patient also reported that she had not purchased live animals and or visited stalls with live animals. She did not visit Jinyintai Hospital or other hospitals in Wuhan. However, she visited local dispensaries in Wuhan to obtain medication. She also reported no contact with persons with respiratory symptoms.Clinical specimens collected on admission included the upper respiratory tract secretions and sputum. These specimens tested positive on 12 January for the CoV family by using a conventional nested RT-PCR [9] . Genomic sequencing analysis included Sanger and next generation sequencing were performed by the Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Center, the Thai Red Cross Society and the Thai National Institute of Health, Department of Medical Sciences and the sequence shared via the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database (EPI_ISL_403962). The sequencing protocol and details are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The patient recovered after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, and returned to China without signs and symptoms on 18 January 2020.A woman in her mid-70s from Wuhan landed at Suvarnabhumi airport on 13 January. She travelled to Thailand with three family members as part of a tour group of 20 (including the case). An airport thermoscanner detected a fever of 38.0 °C that was confirmed with a tympanic thermometer. The patient reported a sore throat, that her fever onset date was 13 January and that she had a cough for an undetermined period. The patient was hospitalised at BIDI. Upon admission, she reported mild tachypnoea, and her CXR was compatible with pneumonia. Similar to case 1, the first CXR taken on 13 January, showed thickening interstitial lung marking at both lower lung fields and both perihilar regions because of interstitial infiltration or crowded lung marking, mild cardiomegaly and dilated aorta. Follow-up CXR on 17 January additionally showed recent hazy with reticular opacities at left middle lung field. The patient was not in severe condition but stable.In the patient interview, she reported that she did not visit the Huanan Seafood Market or other markets. She also reported no contact with pigs, camels, other The phylogenetic tree was created from whole genome alignment with MAFFT using the neighbour-joining method with maximum composite likelihood (MCL) model, uniform site rates and 500 bootstrap tests using MEGA X.mammals (or areas with dead birds), or any consumption of raw or undercooked foods. She stated that she was not in contact with persons with respiratory symptoms.A conventional nested RT-PCR test of this patient was positive for the CoV family [9] . Subsequent genome sequencing was again compatible with the SARS-CoV-2 and shared via the GISAID EpiCoV database (EPI_ISL_403963). A nasopharyngeal swab also tested positive by RT-PCR for adenovirus. The patient was no longer febrile as of 17 January, and after testing negative for the CoV family by conventional nested RT-PCR, she was discharged and she returned to China.Comparing the two genome sequences with a nonredundant selection of representatives from all known CoV families by alignment [10] and phylogenetic tree ( Figure 1A ) [11] shows that they belong to the SARS family of betacoronaviruses and while related to SARS-CoV (80% genome identity), they were most closely related to SARS-like bat CoV from China (88% identity) as closest known sequence at the time of emergence. Structural mapping of mutations in the spike glycoprotein between SARS CoV and the two cases of the SARS-CoV-2 reported here shows only 76% identity at the protein level ( Figure 1B ). This surface protein is critical for ACE2 host receptor interaction and is also a target of the immune response [12, 13] . Given several mutations in the binding interface, it may differ in host cell binding efficiency compared with SARS-CoV which could result in differences in virulence and transmission potential [14, 15] .The genomes of the two separate cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are identical over the full length of close to 30 kb and are furthermore identical to five other sequences (four from Wuhan and one from Zhejiang); together these sequences form the largest cluster of identical cases within the early outbreak, comprising a core of at least indirectly linked cases ( Figure 2 ). Within-outbreak sequence divergence is generally low with 0-9 nt differences over the whole genome and mutations unique to individual strains are possibly related to quality differences of the samples and noise of the methods used for sequencing.Case 1 travelled in a tour group with 15 others and 40 close contacts were identified: 15 members of the tour group, 15 people sitting within two rows in front and back of the seat of case 1 on the same airplane, nine crew members and one port health officer. They wereWithin-outbreak SARS-CoV-2 sequence divergence and clusters, China and Thailand, January 2020 According to the cases' history, the two imported COVID- 19 People travelling out of the city since then may have spread the virus further before travel restrictions were enforced on 23 January [17] .Thailand implemented measures for screening patients travelling from Wuhan since 3 January 2020 at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang, Phuket and Chiang Mai airports, and stepped up surveillance at public and private hospitals. The two cases described here who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were the first confirmed exported cases from China, suggesting early international spread. Therefore, while one cannot exclude the possibility that asymptomatic cases in their incubation period would be missed and become infectious later, screening of incoming travellers from an affected area proved successful at least in these two instances, when COVID-19 cases were detected, isolated, observed and only discharged once they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid response including genome sequencing and sharing via GISAID [18, 19] (https://www.gisaid.org/) enabled fast dissemination of results and provided a glimpse of early transmission patterns in this outbreak.We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in travellers from Wuhan, China to Thailand.

9ukf9vpg,COVID-19: combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments,"Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are characterised by an overexuberant inflammatory response and, for SARS, viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms. 1,2 In our previous Correspondence to The Lancet, 3 we described how BenevolentAI's proprietary artificial intelligence (AI)-derived knowledge graph, 4 queried by a suite of algorithms, enabled identification of a target and a potential therapeutic against SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative organism in COVID-19). We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numbassociated kinase (NAK) family-including AAK1 and GAK-the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro. 5, 6 Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We suggested that this drug could be of use in countering SARS-CoV-2 infections, subject to appropriate clinical testing.To take this work further in a short timescale, a necessity when dealing with a new human pathogen, we re-examined the affinity and selectivity of all the approved drugs in our knowledge graph to identify those with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Such drugs are predicted to be of particular importance in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, when the host inflammatory response becomes a major cause of lung damage and subsequent mortality. Comparison of the properties of the three best candidates are shown in the table. Baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib are potent and selective JAK inhibitors approved for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis. All three are powerful anti-inflammatories that, as JAK-STAT signalling inhibitors, are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines (including interferon-γ) typically observed in people with COVID-19· 2 Although the three candidates have similar JAK inhibitor potencies, a high affinity for AAK1 suggests baricitinib is the best of the group, especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile. 7 The most significant side-effect seen over 4214 patient-years in the clinical trial programmes used for European Medicines Agency registration was a small increase in upper respiratory tract infections (similar to that observed with methotrexate), but the incidence of serious infections (eg, herpes zoster) over 52 weeks' dosing was small (3·2 per 100 patient-years), and similar to placebo. 7 Use of this agent in patients with COVID-19 over 7-14 days, for example, suggests sideeffects would be trivial.Other AI-algorithm-predicted NAK inhibitors include a combination of the oncology drugs sunitinib and erlotinib, shown to reduce the infectivity of a wide range of viruses, including hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. 5, 6 However, sunitinib and erlotinib would be difficult for patients to tolerate at the doses required to inhibit AAK1 and GAK. By contrast, at therapeutic doses used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the free plasma concentrations of baricitinib are predicted to be sufficient to inhibit AAK1, and potentially GAK, in cellbased assays.The predicted inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by baricitinib is unlikely to be observed with other anti-arthritic drugs or JAK inhibitors. Our analysis of the closely related JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and fedratinib (table) illustrates that the predicted unbound plasma exposure required to inhibit the enzymes needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis greatly exceeds the currently tolerated exposures used therapeutically. These drugs are, therefore, unlikely to reduce viral infectivity at tolerated doses, although they might reduce the host inflammatory response through JAK inhibition. Intriguingly, another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, shows no detectable inhibition of AAK1. The high affinity of baricitinib for NAKs, its anti-inflammatory properties, and its ability to ameliorate associated chronic inflammation in interferonopathies, 8 together with its advantageous pharmacokinetic properties, appear to make it a special case among the approved drugs.In addition, the potential for combination therapy with baracitinib is high because of its low plasma protein binding and minimal interaction with CYP enzymes and drug transporters. Furthermore, there is the potential for combining baricitinib with the directacting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) currently being used in the COVID-19 outbreak, since it has a minimal interaction with the relevant CYP drugmetabolising enzymes. Combinations of baricitinib with these direct-acting antivirals could reduce viral infectivity, viral replication, and the aberrant host inflammatory response. This work demonstrates that the use of an AI-driven knowledge graph can facilitate rapid drug development.JS is editor-in-chief of Oncogene.

8xz0ddci,Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: A brief perspective from the front line,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single positive stranded RNA viruses, which belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae. The CoVs genome, ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length, is probably the largest viral RNA known. 1 , 2 Previously, there are six CoVs known to cause human diseases, and these can be divided into low pathogenic and highly pathogenic CoVs. 2 , 3 The low pathogenic CoVs, including 229E, HKU1, OC43 and NL63, account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections and typically cause mild respiratory diseases. 3 , 4 In contrast, the highly pathogenic CoVs, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV, predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia. 2 , 5 SARS-CoV emerged as a new human infection in South China in November 2002 and ended in July 2003. It infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths with an overall mortality rate of about 9.6%. 6 , 7 MERS-CoV, another highly pathogenic CoV, first emerged in Saudi Arabiawas, has caused a total of 2494 laboratoryconfirmed cases and 858 deaths from 27 countries (mortality rate, 34 .4%) since September 2012. ( http://www.who.int/emergencies/ mers-cov/en/ ). 8 These two highly pathogenic β-CoVs have posed a substantial threat to public health.In late December 2019, a novel CoV was identified as a pathogen that caused the outbreak of a SARS-like illness in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and this was officially named as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). Subsequently, the full genomic sequence from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center argued for a bat origin for the 2019-nCoV. 9 From the beginning, clusters of cases of novel CoV infection were reported to be epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 10 Subsequently, the evidence for the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV was further confirmed by the infection of 15 healthcare practitioners after close contact with once infected patient in a Wuhan hospital. 11 As of February 9, 2020, 2019-nCoV has infected a total of 37,590 cases from all over the world.Despite several decades of research, there is a lack of a specific vaccine or treatment for human CoVs. In this review, we summarize the advance of the nature of the 2019-nCoV and its clinical characteristics and therapeutics, which may be critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.The 2019-nCoV belongs to lineage B β-COVs, subgenus Sarbecovirus, which possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA surrounded by an envelope. 9 ( Fig. 1 ). Recently, phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 from Yunnan, China in 2013 with a 96.3% sequence identity, and that this is more correlated two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21(approximately 88% identity) which came from Zhoushan, China in 2018. However, this is discordant with SARS-CoV (approximately 79% identity) and MERS-CoV (approximately 50% identity). 9 , 12-14 The genome of the 2019-nCoV consists of six major functional open reading frames (ORFs), including ORF1a/b, S, E, M, N and several other accessory genes, such as ORF3b and OFR8. Replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are ORF1a/b would be proteolytic cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) which are involved in the transcription and replication of the virus. 9 In addition, the ORF3b encoded a completely novel short protein without an exact function. The new ORF8 likely encodes a secreted protein formed by an alpha-helix, followed by betasheets that contain six strands that have no known functional domain or motif similarly. 9 The S gene of the 2019-nCoV has less than 75% sequence identity to those of the two CoVs, bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV. 14 Similarly, the spike glycoprotein encoded by the S genes of the 2019-nCoV was longer than that of the SARS-CoV. 12 , 14 The spike protein, composed of S1 and S2 domain, was crucial to the determine host tropism and transmission capacity through the mediation of receptor binding and membrane fusion. 12 Among these, the S2 subunit of the 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and has a 99% identity with that of SARS-CoV. 12 The receptor-binding domain, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1 to directly contact the human receptor. Although, the S1 domain of the 2019-nCoV only has approximately 70% identity with SARS-CoV, homology modelling revealed that the 2019-nCoV has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV. 9 , 12 Notably, Zhou et al. found that the 2019-nCoV just like SARS-Cov may also use ACE2 as an entry receptor in the ACE2expressing cells, and the majority of which are type II alveolar cells (AT2) in human lung. 14 , 15 Therefore, further investigations are needed to determine whether ACE2 targeting drugs would be effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV.Since the genomic sequences of the 2019-nCoV obtained from different patients were extremely similar to each other, which exhibited more than 99 • 9% sequence identity, 12 , 14 it could be reasonably considered that the 2019-nCoV originated from one source rather than a mosaic and could be detected relatively rapidly. However, mutations need to be constantly monitored when the virus is transmitting to an increasing number of individuals.On the basis of the initial investigation, the shared history of exposure to the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market highly suggested that wild animals sold in the market such as bamboo rats, raccoons, and snakes would be the original source of the novel virus. 16 Soon afterwards, the traceability analysis supported that the 2019-nCoV would be from Rhinolophus. This is with the phylogenetic analysis results that the 2019-nCoV was most related to BatCoV RaTG13 from the bat. 13 , 17 However, intermediate host is likely to exist between bats and humans which is similar to masked palm civet for SARS-CoV35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. The newest research suspected pangolins are potential intermediate hosts for novel coronavirus but may not the only.Epidemiologically, 2019-nCoV is highly infectious with about 2 h survive time in the air. The incubation period after infection is generally 4-8 days. 10 , 18 , 19 All age groups are susceptible to the virus, of which elderly patients with comorbidities are more likely to experience severe illness. 10 , 18 , 19 Importantly, the people who are primary, asymptomatic and in incubation period are the main sources of infection, which is of critical significance to the epidemic prevention and control. 16 Up to now, respiratory droplets is the major route of transmission. Besides, the fecal-oral route of transmission is considered but unconfirmed because 2019-nCoV nucleic acids could be detected in the stool samples of pneumonia patients with abdominal symptoms. 20 Vertical transmission between mothers and infants is another possible route based on the finding that a 30 h-old newborn was confirmed with 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Children's Hospital. Some researchers also warn that the transmission through the ocular surface must not be ignored considering human conjunctival epithelium can be contaminated easily by infectious droplets and body fluids. 21 To our knowledge, basic reproduction rate (R0), as the rate reflecting the speed of disease transmission, differs in time periods estimated by researchers and is also substantially affected by reporting rate. The latest R0 is 2.68 estimated by Wu et al., roughly identical to the rate published by WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control, all of which indicate that the number of infected patients will increase as long as R0 is greater than 1. 16 , 22 , 23 As a result, the WHO has declared the outbreak of 2019-nCOV pneumonia to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 30 and adopted control measures to reduce R0 rate to below 1 globally.The present clinical data obtained from 31 provinces of China revealed that the 2019-nCoV shared many clinical features with SARS-CoV. 24 , 25 The median age of these patients was 47 years old, with a predominance of male patients (58.2%). The mean incubation time was 3.0 days (range: 0-24.0 days). 24 The most common symptoms are fever (87.9%), fatigue (69.6%), dry cough (67.7%) and myalgia (34.8%), and these are accompanied with rhinobyon, rhinorrhoea, pharyngalgia and diarrhea in few patients 24 ( Table 1 ) of these patients were characterized by dyspnea and hypoxemia, which can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in one week. 18, 24 Some laboratory tests could provide some hints of the early forms of the disease, such as lymphopenia (82.1%), thrombocytopenia (36.2%) and leukopenia (33.7%). Most patients demonstrated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition, severe cases could have increasing levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and creatine. 18, 24 All suspected patients are recommended to be examined by chest computerized tomography (CT). Most of the confirmed patients suffered from pneumonia (76.4%), and were characterized with groundglass opacity (50.0%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (46.0%) in the chest CT, and even subsegmental consolidation in severe patients. 24, 26 To date, most of these patients had a good prognosis. However, the mortality rate was higher in elder patients with chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension and angiocardiopathy, etc.) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, reaching 17-38% in recent reports. 18, 19 The diagnosis is based on the epidemiological risks, clinical features and laboratory tests. Patients who have a history of travel from Chinese city of Wuhan or close contact with confirmed or suspected case of 2019-nCoV, and then present with fever or respiratory symptoms within incubation period should be suspected. In addition, due to the discovery of asymptomatic CoVcarriers and negative of viral nucleic acid test in many times before comfirmed, the typical pulmonary imaging performance can not be ignored, and even can be used as a preliminary screening method. Positive of viral nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR detection with specimens from the respiratory tract or serum are confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. 14Despite several therapeutic options have been experimented in 2019-nCoV infected patients, there are still no specific ther-apies. As one kind of RNA virus, 2019-nCov may possess some similar functional proteins for processing virus replication and assembly to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thus, the HIV protease inhibitors may also effective to 2019-nCov. At present, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) combination, which was previously confirmed effective in SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, has been recommended for the treatment of 2019-nCoV in the latest guideline. 27 , 28 Besides, by homology modelling and molecular docking, another anti-HIV drug nelfinavir was predicted to be active against 2019-nCoV and could be a potential drugs. 29 Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development, has been proved to be a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral. 30 , 31 Wang et al. showed that RDV could inhibit 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. 32 And the successful use of RDV in the first case of 2019-nCoV in the United States posted the bright perspective. 33 More promisingly, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of safety and efficacy of RDV is ongoing in Wuhan (NCT04252664). Meanwhile, Wang and his colleagues also provided evidence of the potential that chloroquine was also effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection. 32 Arbidol has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against respiratory viruses. Recent news reported that arbidol can inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro. A phase 4 clinical trial of arbidol for new coronavirus pneumonia had been registered (NCT04246242).As for monoclonal antibody (mAb), several researches showed that the combination of RDV and mAb would likely to be the ideal treatment for 2019-nCoV. Tian et al. reported for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human mAb, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV receptor binding domain. 34 Therefore, CR3022 may be developed to prevent and treat new coronavirus infection. Additionally, The janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib, which can disrupt receptor mediated endocytosis and interrupt the passage of the virus into cells, was identified to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells and be a potential treatment for 2019-nCoV. 35 In addition to the therapeutics discussed above, Chinese healthcare practitioners also have started clinical trails of stem cell infusion and traditional Chinese medicine for severe patients. We ex- March 9, 2020; 11:25 ] pect that these therapies will improve clinical outcomes in 2019-nCoV patients.The world has experienced three outbreaks of highly pathogenic CoVs, including the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012 and now, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. [6] [7] [8] It is clear that 2019-nCoV is another lineage B β-COV and has been postulated that bat is the primary host. 9 Despite only 75% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV, 9 , 14 2019-nCoV shares many features with SARS-CoV, such as epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and the entry receptor ACE2 and so on. 14 , 15 , 24 , 25 The 2019-nCoV jumps unpredictably, spreads rapidly and has posed severe threat to public health. Although the overall mortality rate is lower than SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, the mortality in elder patients with chronic diseases and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, reaching 17-38% in recent reports. 18, 19 As yet, no specific therapy of proven efficacy has been recommended for human CoVs infection. Retrospective analysis showed that most deaths of the CoVs infection patients were due to severe pneumonia. 2 , 5 Previous studies indicated that viral evasion of host maladjusted immune responses are believed to play critical roles in acute lung injury (ALI), in addition to CoVs-induced direct cytopathic effects. 5 Indeed, changes of some immune index have been detected in the CoVs infection patients, such as lymphopenia, monocytosis and elevated cytokine levels. 2 , 5 , 25 The treatment of corticosteroids may reduce the risk of lung inflammation but also delay CoVs clearance in addition to other side effects. [36] [37] [38] Thus, the topic of corticosteroid use in patients with CoVs has been a matter of debate for years. The available clinical data tends to argue for no net benefit derived from corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. [38] [39] [40] Recently, the study of the largest case series of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan showed that there was no effective outcomes were observed with usage of varied dose of methylprednisolone. 25 The outbreak of 2019-nCoV poses a serious challenge to China. Currently, the most effective measures to 2019-nCoV are still early detection and quarantine of new sources of infection, and early diagnosis and supportive treatments for confirmed patients. Considerable advances have been made in preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases since the SARS-CoV epidemic 17 years ago. In addition, based on the successful therapy of SARS-CoV, a series of effective treatments have been adopted for the patients with 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we are confident that these would effectively curb the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. The epidemic peak may soon be reached and the final victory is not far away.The authors declare that they have no competing interests."
